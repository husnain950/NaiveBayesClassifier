Pos,    stuart little   is one of the best family films to come out this year    it s a cute   funny and very good natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords    though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about   i do know that this film does not disappoint    finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be   with a few surprising twists   some very funny moments   and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie    stuart little is a mouse    he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption   he now lives with the littles    a nice little   no pun intended   family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city    they have a little boy george   played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki   and now they have a new son    at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat    george doesn t take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first   but once the two play together they instantly bond    stuart however is missing something   and he wants to know who his real parents are    the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back    hesitating the littles know what s best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat   he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart s past ending up to a sentimental and very heart warming ending    one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects    just like in   star wars   episode 1  the phantom menace   stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real    from the detail of their fur   to the detail of the way the walk   the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $90 million dollar film and it shows    another movie that this has in common with is   babe   with it s talking animals and people understanding them    it has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids    michael j   fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the   homeward bound   movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could    he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable    another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball    when he was timon in 1994 s   the lion king   i would have sworn he was a comedian   and now in   stuart little   he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike    for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well    she fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr   little    both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996 s   jerry maguire      even though stuart little is completely cgi   the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other       stuart little   is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter    we get entertainment   laughs   cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie    its nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see    even though it has a $90 million dollar budget i m sure it will make over that or just below it respectively    for all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie   i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know   stuart little   and   toy story 2   are by far the best family films this year    a winner      
Neg, a movie like mortal kombat   annihilation works   and must be reviewed on   multiple levels    first   there s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie    but occasionaly   almost as if making an ironic   self depreciating remark   the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery    no no        just kidding    had you going there for a moment   didn t i    in all seriousness however   and to be fair to the movie   it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints   that of a movie watcher unfamiliar   or only marginally familiar   with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon   and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games    the first movie   mortal kombat   1995     concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth   and it s 5 billion inhabitants      the mortals won   and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth    unfortunately   shao khan was a poor loser   and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway   ready to take over the planet   as our heroes assumed a fighting stance    the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those   like myself   who are fans of the game    i d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie    the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself   and they didn t try to overachieve    there were a lot of really cool fight scenes   with really cool accompanying music     intersperesed with some distracting   but ultimately non intrusive   bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot    and   as we know   the movie was a smashing success at the box office    mortal kombat   annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off   with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie    shao khan has decided that he s going to take over the earth * anyways *   and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament    thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused   being trite   being silly   and being just plain stupid    one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought   hey   that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now      too bad they didn t simply stick with the formula from the first movie    i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture   but here are the high points     * the acting is truly bad    sandra hess   playing the sonya blade character   is particularly execrable   especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage   a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie       * in one of the worst pieces of mis casting i think i ve * ever * seen   james remar plays raiden   the god of thunder    in the first movie   christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke   a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics    i generally like it when actors are cast against type   tim   tiny   lister   jr   being cast as the president of the u   s   in the fifth element   for example     and remar has always been one of my favorite   utility   actors but he s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn t even have the luxury of amused self awareness     * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important   but then never seen again     * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks   including a muddled scene where liu kang   robin shou   seeks out nightwolf   litefoot     has a mystical hallucination   and then wanders off with jade   irina pantaeva      for these reasons   and many others     i can only give the movie a 2               unless you re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie    in that case   the following critiques also apply     * sandra hess   while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson   who played sonya blade in the first movie     is much more convincing as a fighter    wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer    hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts   and puts together a much more believable fight scene     * in the fights   each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game   and often more      sonya does her   kiss of death     jax does his   earthquake     liu kang does his   animality     and so on    a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely     * there aren t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first   because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between    silly   silly folks    and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud wrestling match    lame and so obviously sexist even i   politically incorrect   for the most part   noticed and remarked upon it     * the special effects are generally better   except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their   animalities      motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie    for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games   i give this a 5    you ll probably like it   but not nearly as much as you liked the first one    
Neg, and just when you thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners   not rating anything lower than your standard   this movie sucks     along comes this cinematic atrocity and he s forced to take out his secret weapon and spray it with a stench so thick   even the bravest movie goer would think twice about seeing this waste of time    yes   despite being a third sequel to a successful original movie   the latest highlander doesn t seem to have anything going for it    oh stinky movie   let me count thee ways        plot     from what i understood   a really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal       or  something along those lines    critique   a complete and utter mess    disjointed   incoherent   boring   corny   filled with bad dialogue       and  that s just the first thirty minutes !  this film doesn t seem to know what to do with itself    it s confusing to anyone who doesn t know the series   i include myself in that group   and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series   i include die hard highlander fan the arrow in that group      the film doesn t explain anything about itself       it  just goes from one inexplicable situation to another    one moment they re in the present time   the next moment   they re in italy in the 1600s    why    who knows    what are they talking about    no idea    flashbacks mixed in with the present   mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again   and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene ! !  hullo         !    confused yet    i was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story    random swordplay   mad max like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s    or were they in the present at that time    who knows       and to be honest       who  seriously cares !  this series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery a long time ago   but sadly   someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it    please   please       for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of movie making   and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film   put this series to bed and end it !  even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one    the director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material   but all he could come up with is plenty of slo mo action   some fast motion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere    and is there anything spectacular about the sword play or fight scenes    nope    and i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face close ups       yipes    the man is not aging gracefully   is he    oh boy   and i haven t even gotten around to the greatest piece of over acting that i ve seen in years    the man who plays kell in this movie   bruce payne   should get a ham trophy for literally chewing up every piece of scenery that he gets near    overacting is not a hobby for this guy       it s  a living !  he s also very funny   not purposely though    all in all   the movie stinks    nuff said    
Pos, every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio   with every indication that it will be a stinker   and to everybody s surprise   perhaps even the studio   the film becomes a critical darling    mtv films   election   a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon   is a current example    did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened    the plot is deceptively simple    george washington carver high school is having student elections    tracy flick   reese witherspoon   is an over achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question   way   way   high    mr     m     matthew broderick     sick of the megalomaniac student   encourages paul   a popular but slow jock to run    and paul s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well   for personal reasons    the dark side of such sleeper success is that   because expectations were so low going in   the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be    you can t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews   which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have     election   a good film   does not live up to its hype    what makes  election  so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from  rushmore    released a few months earlier    the similarities are staggering    tracy flick    election    is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs   and is involved with the school play    max fischer    rushmore    is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs   and is involved with the school play    the most significant tension of  election  is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student    the most significant tension of  rushmore  is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student    tracy flick is from a single parent home   which has contributed to her drive    max fischer is from a single parent home   which has contributed to his drive    the male bumbling adult in  election    matthew broderick   pursues an extramarital affair   gets caught   and his whole life is ruined    he even gets a bee sting    the male bumbling adult in  rushmore    bill murray   pursues an extramarital affair   gets caught   and his whole life is ruined    he gets several bee stings    and so on    what happened    how is it that an individual screenplay    rushmore    and a novel    election    contain so many significant plot points   and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other   made from two different studios   from a genre   the high school geeks revenge movie   that hadn t been fully formed yet    even so   the strengths of  election  rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick   witherspoon   and newcomer jessica campbell   as paul s anti social sister   tammy    broderick here is playing the mr   rooney role from  ferris bueller    and he seems to be having the most fun he s had since then    witherspoon is a revelation    it s early in the year   it s a comedy   and teenagers have little clout   but for my money   witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination    and once campbell s character gets going   like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium   then you re won over    one thing that s been bothering me since i ve seen it    there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film    i suppose that   coming from mtv films   i should expect no less        but the film starts off light and airy   like a sitcom    as the screws tighten   and the tensions mount   alexander payne decides to add elements that   frankly   distract from the story    it is bad enough that mr   m doesn t like tracy s determination to win at all costs   but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship    even so   there s no logical reason why mr   m has an affair when he does    there s a lot to like in  election    but the plot similarities to  rushmore    and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex driven   mark this as a disappointment    
Neg, for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo   the killer   hard boiled   face off   appears to have made an exciting   elegant   charming spy thriller   kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american   read   unsophisticated   hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them    sadly   as the picture progresses   the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up   two hour long episode of magyuver    and not a particularly good one at that    what went wrong    mi2 begins flashily enough   that initial flash leading us to believe that it ll soon give way to something of a plot   but it only gives way to more flash   then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise s firing gun just so they can die really cool    early on   during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt   tom cruise   and nyah nordoff hall   thandie newton     woo works some of his trademark magic    in one hypnotic   though completely inexplicable sequence   the director slows the action down to a languid semi stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other s eyes with come hither sexuality       just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance   coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff    prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain   sans scaffolding   then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another    why    i haven t the foggiest    i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply    with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine   the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects    it s possible that these   spies   could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off   though of course this is never explored    the scenes i ve described are really only included to titillate   not to give any insight into character    god forbid    woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic   but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial like visuals    still in terms of crackerjack eye candy   the opening has much to cherish    cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices   the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is      between the frantic dancing   woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact    the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way   yet it has style and something of soul   and woo casts a bit of a spell on us    sure it s all smoke and mirrors   but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product    thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight    they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres    newton bats her eyes flirtatiously    cruise grins a little too slyly    the cruise character   ethan hunt   has been drastically altered since the first film    here cruise plays him more as a hip   sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1    he s cool and dashing   which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut   which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film     and blustered his way through magnolia   quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90 s      sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise s initial   i m the man !    charm and more slo mo close ups of his preening mug    mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act   which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won t stop    the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle   the first gun fight in the film     which really should be unheard of in a john woo film   but alas this particular battle could ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi   of course excepting the   symbolic   pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture      we ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand    it isn t done any differently here    the action is pure hard target \ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind    he s cool for sure but he s made to be as empty as the movie    the actor isn t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks   he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment   be it during a gunfight   before one or after one    when he s not beaming away   he s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell   but woo s editing seriously undermines the effort    he fetishizes cruise s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof    i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he s really austin powers    in a classic woo action moment   ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin up boy angel of death    the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual   one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise   basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does      the lead bad guy   played by the appropriately british dougray scott   and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken       on motorcycles    though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment   the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug   only to fly about a hundred feet   still in bear hug position     land on a beach below and begin a mano e mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a   so you thought i was dead            not to worry   cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat    what a hero !  you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2 s plot    my reasoning is simple   i m not sure of any good it would do    the film itself has absolutely no concern with story   only with hurtling forth to the next   special   effect    i wasn t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video    nobody will go to this for the plot   and if they do they ll surely regret it    as summer movies evolve   or devolve   character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing    in mi   the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma s   that film s director   stylistic flourishes   while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo s non stop masturbatory pandemonium    it s irrelevant in every sense   as is character    all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors    
Neg, for better or worse   the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated   oversexed   underwritten thrillers    apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn t change a thing   since body of evidence wasn t written by him   but has a puzzling eszterhas ish presence all over it    in other words   it s a   really dirty and b   really   really stupid    madonna   first warning sign   stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job   she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi naked   presumably for the edification of the shrimp    she s been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover    already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect    the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she s under thirty   or at least looks it     and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men    what s worse is that the movie confirms all the above   and wallows in them as well    madonna s character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition       and yes   there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy    this movie leave no scummy stone unturned      anyway   willem dafoe   very good but completely wasted   also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna s sexuality    how do we know this    because his character is set up with the token wife and kids    how obvious is it that he s gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up    and get kicked out of the house    and get welcomed back anyway    don t skip to the end yet   we re just getting warmed up    dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie    most of it is about as erotic as open heart surgery   since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax   always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don t know the first thing about * really * kinky sex   and smashed light bulbs    don t ask    another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story   it s insanely dull    what s worse is that body of evidence is dull * everywhere *   not just in the sex scenes    the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes    the thriller business itself is ridiculous    it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs   and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor    and the ending    another homage to eszterhas   maybe       is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact * frame * where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in    the director is uli edel   all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f   everyone has to eat   i guess   but this isn t a meal ticket   it s leftovers    
Neg, i have a great idea for a movie   one that can t miss    see   i ve got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack   and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances    it s about professional basketball   so i ll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity    as for what the movie is actually about       well   that will all sort itself out eventually    i figure it will be a comedy   so i ll throw a half dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with    maybe we ll put a gender spin on it   see if we can get some women out to see it   too    eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind    twister   as inane as the script might have been   at least required some creative technicians   mission   impossible   overwrought plot and all   at least involved genuine effort    eddie just sits there   hawking up a formula story without any laughs   and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required    whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin   a new york limo driver and die hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team    coach john bailey   dennis farina   has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas   and the losses are beginning to mount    the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess   frank langella   to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team    the winner   surprise   surprise   is eddie   who becomes a fan favorite   and eventually the actual coach    the knicks continue to lose   but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops    incidentally   the knicks eventually start winning    please raise your hand if that comes as a shock   and i will invite you to my all night marathon of the bad news bears   major league   angels in the outfield   the mighty ducks   the big green   cool runnings and little giants    awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds   it s what they do    those teams usually involve kids   for a very sound comedic reason   it s funnier when they screw up   and they re more sympathetic    those which  don t  involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles   for another very sound comedic reason   they generally have developed some sort of comic timing    eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it s easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players    this finds nba players like greg ostertag   dwayne schintzius   rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper   though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players      perhaps that all didn t matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines   and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick    steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming     don t blame me   i just work here      perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn t a movie    it s a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while    among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump   new york mayor rudolph giulianni   former new york mayor ed koch   david letterman   letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam   espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert   as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas    and those are the real jokes in eddie    nothing these individuals say or do is funny   you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice     hey   it s donald trump !    or   hey   it s mujibur and sirajul !    it s difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can t even get the cliches in a cliche ridden genre script right    the knicks coach who is eddie s antagonist early in the film reappears at the end   but he isn t given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs    neither is frank langella   and none of the athlete actors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of    that leaves her to do her street wise miss thang routine   but with no character   no sharp lines and no help    eddie isn t just a bad movie with a formulaic premise    it s a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended   because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie   and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy    
Pos, if he doesn=92t watch out   mel gibson is in danger of being known as someone other than mad max    of course there are still a few big guns in this film   but there=92s some accomplished acting too    although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti hero skin as his career progresses   here he explores a new genre   the businessman as action hero    in ron howard=92s latest film   gibson plays tom mullen   a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers    mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom   but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation    a veteran of numerous hard nosed business negotiations   the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive   he has to play his hand differently    the casting is what puts this film over the top    the trio of gibson   the kidnappers  mastermind   gary sinise   and fbi team leader   delroy lindo   play off of each other wonderfully    sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark    his speech to mullen over a walkie talkie about h   g   wells=92 morlocks and eloi reveal his vision of=  society   mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes dwell below   feeding off the unsuspecting    gibson=92s character is an all american hero with a few flaws    his cowboy=  tactics tend to work   but they are also what got him into this situation to begin with    in a round about way   if he weren=92t known as a man who i= s willing to buy his way out of trouble   his son wouldn=92t have been kidnapped    as sinise says   you=92re a payer    you did it once and now you=92re going to do it again      one of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities    lindo calls home to talk to his kids   obviously shaken at working this case    even the kidnappers are real people   arguing about the ultimate fate of sean mullen and feeding him candy bars    gibson=92s break down on the balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective    it=92s one of the best filmed representations of a man=92s world falling apart that i=92ve seen    it=92s not all perfect    the shoot  em upending   while emotionally satisfying seems tacked on to be just that rather than to provide a powerful resolution    as well crafted as the scene is   we=92ve seen it before    mullen=92s wife   rene russo   has several good moments   but occasionally just seems to be there    while adequate   brawley nolte   sean   doesn=92t provide much to the film other than occupying space to build the story around    but you=92ll ignore these problems as each minute of the movie builds on the previous one    forget about the large coke   you won=92t want to leave for that five minute break an hour later    
Pos, if there s one thing in common about all of hollywood s major studios   it s that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more    although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures   fox searchlight and fine line respectively     it s obvious there s no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater    so when a movie like gary ross  pleasantville comes along   wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production   it s a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes    although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted   pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no thought movie    quite the opposite is true   in fact   as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen    the story   both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation   captures the essence of statement making in the cinema    not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution   and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross  work   it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough    kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture    it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who   through quite a bit of luck   find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named   pleasantville      maguire   as the reserved bud parker   is perfect for the pseudo world   but the rebellious mary sue   witherspoon   is not at all made for the father knows best times    it s not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end   and begins to teach the townspeople   in a quite unlikely way   what life is * really * like    soon hues of color creep into the black and white world   and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism   others fear the strangeness    at one end is a soda shop owner turned painter named mr   johnson   jeff daniels   and at the other end is a close minded mayor   j   t    walsh   and his chamber of commerce   but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town    fine performances are turned in all around    maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads   but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j   t    walsh   in his latest and final posthumous performance      daniels brings an atmosphere of awe   inspiration   and hope to his character   whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness   almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman s envy    for daniels   it s his most commendable performance of the last three years   or more   and for walsh   it s a complementary exclamation point on a fine career    also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen   and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish    there s not much to dislike about pleasantville   and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don t    
Neg, if you haven t plunked down your hard earned money yet for   wild wild west     the latest summer holiday offering from will smith   let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck s frappacino or on a ben & jerry s sundae    these treats are great relief from the summer heat    in contrast   this film made me simmer in disappointment    i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat    this was true of star wars episode i   but at least in that film   the story and the characters were still in the back seat    in this film   they are no where to be found    what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats   lots of female extras who look like can can dancers   and a clunky   80 foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula    two men are asked to stop this threat    one is artemus gordon   kevin kline     an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents    among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest    the other man is jim west   will smith     who prefers the shoot first then shoot some more method of investigating    although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success   their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate   two man vaudevillian act    for example   there is a scene where west   being more debonair than the reserved gordon   notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat   which is what it is currently filled with       now touch my breast     west says    gordon does so and then softly coos his approval    i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness    the script fails to generate any sense of drama   humor   or fun for that matter    i did enjoy kline s reserved performance   but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith    could it be that will smith is just so bankable that he s not even required to act    it was as if the director was yelling   will smith   do your own thing       and  action !    here s an example    in this scene   will smith is about to be hanged by a group of angry white people    he must endear himself to the crowd to escape    the director yells     will smith   do your own thing       and  action !    in another scene   he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades       will smith   do your own thing       and  action !    worse still   the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess    there are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look    there s actually a lot of imagination at work in this film    there are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced   but all of this imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat    and that s too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his  thing     this film might have been palatable    as it turns out     wild wild west   is the wild   wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year    
Pos, if you want some hearty laughs   then rat race is the movie for you    this unpretentious little comedy   which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype   will have you bouncing in your theater seat    and while the film fits neatly into the low brow   slapstick school of comedy   one refreshing aspect is its lack of mean spiritedness    the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner   john cleese   who must race from vegas to a bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city   n   m    inside the locker is a duffel bag containing $2 million    the first one to open the locker   gets the bag and the money    what the group of participants doesn t know is that cleese s donald sinclair     i can do anything i want   i m eccentric !     is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel    the participants include vera   whoopi goldberg   and merrill   lanai chapman     a newly reunited mother and daughter   disgraced pro football referee owen templeton   cuba gooding jr       italian tourist mr   pollini   rowan atkinson     randy pear   jon lovitz   and his family   the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody   seth green and vince vieluf     and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer   breckin meyer      various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city    screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another    the most side splitting situations involve vera and merrill s encounter with the squirrel lady   a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates   owen s commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look alikes on their way to a lucy convention   the cody brothers misadventures with a hot air balloon   a flying cow and a monster truck   and the pear family s stopover at a barbie museum   which turns out not to be what they think it is    the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman s script builds the laughs    without going into detail   this bit segues from the museum to hitler s touring car   to eva braun s dark lipstick   to lovitz burning his tongue   culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans    rat race s cast is first rate    cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap   lovitz is   at first   a bit whiny   but his character grows on you   gooding is having a fine romp   and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese s deadpan assistant   a man   born without a personality      the film is directed by jerry zucker   who knows something about comedy    along with his brother   david   and friend jim abrahams   he was responsible for such hits as airplane !  and ruthless people    a throwaway subplot   which is good for some laughs   features cleese and his buddies   betting on a series of outlandish situations   including one dealing with a hooker and pepto bismol    this is a fun little feature    the only letdown comes at the finale   which is too touchy feely and sweet   almost negating what came before it    rat race is a summer sleeper   but it will keep you awake   as will the laughter of those watching around you    
Pos, in the opening shot of midnight cowboy   we see a close up of a blank movie screen at a drive in    we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses  hooves    without an image projected onto the screen   the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind s eye    even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie   somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema    but do cowboys really exist   or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper    exploring this theme   director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream   an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept    is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend    midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream   like image of the cowboy   is merely a myth    as joe buck migrates from place to place   he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself   only further degeneration    during the opening credits   joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne   the alamo      as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show   a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper   but he s dead      a troubled expression comes across joe s face   as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone    having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth   joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody    joe s persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream    he romanticizes about making it in the big city   but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance    by the end of midnight cowboy   joe buck loses everything and gains nothing    just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen   we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success    but how realistic are these ideals    joe had raped and been raped in texas    the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york   but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas    alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation    the ability to pack up one s belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention    schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe s abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny    we understand that joe adopts the fa   ade of a cowboy   a symbol of virility and gallantry   as an attempt to neutralize his shame    he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york    in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe s encounter with the gay student   joe buck spills ketchup on himself    standing up   we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh    schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe s virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals   signifying emasculation    beyond the symbol of castration   the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin s first sexual encounter   a reference to joe s first homosexual liaison    the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe s emasculation    it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients   but effortlessly attracts men    joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity   new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff      there are two predominant images of new york    the first is that new york is the rich   cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty    the other new york is travis bickle s new york   a seedy   corruptive hell on earth    joe envisions new york as the former   but is presented with the latter    mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine   he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men    joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york   but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions    the people steal joe s money   the landlord confiscates his luggage   and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity    what has become of joe s american dream    schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party    joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food   drugs   and sex    at the party   all of joe and ratzo s desires are made flesh   joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami    contrasting joe s daily struggles   shots of warhol s crew display wanton indulgence    there is an irreverence in the partygoers  attitude   we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular   orgies breaking out in the periphery   and drugs passed around like party favors    the party makes a mockery of joe  s ideals    joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america   scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe s toils    the american dream   schlesinger suggests   is merely a proletarian fantasy   for those who are content no longer dream   but become indolent    as joe heads to miami   all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him    his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished    for joe   nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately   he surrenders the identity    tossing his boots into the garbage   he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami    the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus   more introspective   taking only a few glances outside the window    instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york   schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe    reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus  window with joe hardly taking notice    the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before    the world seems smaller to joe now   the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream    no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo   he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means    midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream    there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians   you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family    then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock   with perseverance   can make a fortune in the big city    joe s attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york    during his search for an intangible paradise   joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man    an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream   joe buck s progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons    
Neg, let s get this one over with as quickly as possible    if there was a possibility to receive a refund   this review would not be forthcoming    but as it is     godzilla   is without a doubt the loudest   longest   and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio    producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves   and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch   last year at merienbad   until they can grasp the idea of content and plot    no amount of hype   no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine   billy the kid vs    dracula         godzilla   opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs    we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship   a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins      well   the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature    later   a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache   jean reno   interview the sole survivor    in a state of shock   the only thing the man can utter is the word   gojira     the japanese name of the famed beast      we are then introduced to dr   nick tatopoulos   matthew broderick   with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film      he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population    he is immediately drafted by the u   s   military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature    in a short amount of time   another fishing boat   loaded with canned tuna from the u   s   and korea for some reason   is found grounded in jamaica    well   it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york    when the beast finally appears   he tears up one building   stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert   thumbs up for new york      the military   with dr   tatopoulos s help   have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system    it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr   tatopoulos who snaps the beast s picture    the monster eats the fish   the military starts shooting   and the chase is on   with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage    working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple   dr   totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open   even though new york has been evacuated      well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant    needless to say   no one believes the good doctor about his discovery   so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster s nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city   even though the monster isn t dead yet      i sincerely hope that i ve completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film    i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous   or foolish   enough to drop down an hour s wage on this tripe    everything about   godzilla   reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast    the script   and let s be clear here   by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years   razzie   award    the dialogue between maria pitillo   as audrey timmonds   dr   tatopoulos  estranged girlfriend   and mr   broderick is so adolescent   it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief   as happened during the screening i witnessed      the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn t take itself so damn seriously    but to what end   as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature   nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind    no   godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it    the film is bleak and ugly looking    taking place at night during a rain storm   the movie has little or no depth    everything is ugly and dark    new york has never looked so inhospitable since   death wish      in an attempt to give the film some color   audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue    the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica   where dr   tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint    the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up    you know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint    for a scientist   this is very poor observation    let s look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film   this activity   is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game      1     why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs   and how do those eggs fuse into one beast    2     why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate   such as new york   to nest    i don t think iguana s have a habit of migrating    3     how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system   slice a submarine in half   yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin   in comparison   steel cable on the brooklyn bridge    4     the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it s suspension cables    5     did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly    if so   then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures       note   each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide    godzilla would have to be over 1   000 feet tall to carry them all      6     godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters   but new york cabs are made of stronger steel    7     godzilla can out maneuver helicopters   bullets   torpedoes and missiles   but can t catch you on foot    8     taxis can out maneuver godzilla    9     godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can t tear through the park avenue tunnel    10     why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla    maybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel    11     galapagos iguana s actually live in the french polynesian islands    12     why was dr   tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway    13     how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day   and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey    14     new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting    new yorkers hate beta cam    i could go on and on   but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is    don t be fooled   this film has less gray matter than any episode of   america s funniest home videos      the performances in the film are singularly bland    not one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror    the characters   in the midst of the onslaught   have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee   failed relationships   career choices    the only common occurrence that doesn t take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement   but then that would have made them believable    godzilla for the most part is okay    the design of the beast is funky   if not very memorable    one thing that comes to mind   the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark   namely his atomic breath    now   i for one can t quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait    a good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly    there is so much wrong with this film that i can t really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted   except for my divorce      any film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac    the addition of the baby raptors   ah   i meant godzillas     are nothing but a direct rip off of  jurassic park     but with none of that film s suspense or tension    suffice to say that     godzilla   is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade    this is a film that needed the hype    with the current level of writing and directing   nothing else about the film succeeds    if you ve seen the trailers   you ve seen the best parts    my only suggestion for mr   d and mr   e   is that they could always go back to selling shoes       this film could be the next   rocky horror      only it s not funny !  
Pos, meet joe black   reviewed on nov   27/98    starring brad pitt   anthony hopkins   claire forlani  in   meet joe black     brad pitt plays death    that s all that really needs to be said   but nevertheless   i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description    death decides to take a holiday   what with all the rigors of soul collecting and all   and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it s like to be human    death assumes the body of brad pitt   and from there   much trouble ensues    for one thing   death as pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter   played by claire forlani    obviously this enrages hopkins   because really   what can death offer    besides eternal damnation   of course    there is also a sub plot about forlani s ex boyfriend   she dumps him for pitt   trying to take over hopkins company       meet joe black   runs just under three hours    i ve always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics       meet joe black   is neither historical nor is it an epic   though i get the feeling martin brest   the director   desperately wants it to be    every single scene in the movie goes on about 3 4 minutes too long    and the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should    a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent   instead of just good   which is what it is    pitt   an actor i normally loathe   is actually quite engaging as death    i believed his performance   and i could see why forlani s character would fall in love with him    i have to agree with roger ebert   though   who found it hard to believe that an entity that s been around for all time wouldn t know what peanut butter was    that has nothing to do with pitt s performance   of course   but it is a little distracting    hopkins gives his usual excellent performance    he s able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left   without making him an obnoxious whiner    and in her first major studio role   claire forlani is surprisingly good    she has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her    so     meet joe black   is a good movie hampered by it s ridiculous running time    had the film been cut by an hour or so   i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review    
Neg, okay   i just don t know why   but i seem to be getting this diversion to disney made real life actors movies       as  well as real life acting tim allen movies    i couldn t even make it through   the santa clause     so why did i even see this       just to make an idle point   i did like   toy story     but that was good   also   i have this aversion to bad french farces   and if they remake them into american films    well   this is my excuse   it was prom night   i m not a prom person   my best friend and i impulsively went to the drive ins where they were playing   grosse pointe blank     wouldn t mind seeing it again   but i had to suffer through this first    i agreed to go    ugh    in all fairness   i can say that at least this inane plot wasn t dreamed by an american    it was originally a french film released in america under the pseudonym of   little indian   big city     french title     un indien dans la ville        i stayed away from it like it was limburgher   and according to roger ebert   that was a good idea    but i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement    the stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his current marriage    let me clarify   his wife   jobeth williams   left him years ago   and i mean years   around 13 or so   and went to an island in the carribean or something    he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this       thing     played with an emphasis on over done by lolita davidovitch   who is usually good      she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off    he meets him   he has a weird name   mimi seku   i think       or  as the bad joke goes     mitsubishi     laugh track cue     he knows english   they fish   more bad jokes   pirhanna joke   the kid has a pet spider   he makes a promise to take him to the statue of liberty       you  know the drill    now this is where the plot complicates   well   complicates for this one   at least     the fish out of water joke switches from tim allen on an island to his island son in new york city    tim is a stock broker and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died and he wasn t able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is   martin short    a russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere   how come in every hokey french import   there is a mob   !    tim learns a lesson of life from his son and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island even though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries    the story is crap   the jokes are hokey and not really funny   and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting    but the material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldn t help it    the whole time   i kept thinking that a grown person had to think this up and several more grown people had to do this    at the end of filming   did they all scream out     we ve made a great movie   guys !    i sure hope not    big question to get from this film   why would someone want to remake what was billed as one of the worst films of all time if they re just going to do it the exact same way    huh    my   for some of the actors  names and a joke or two that made me chuckle   i guess       okay    so i really feel bad for it   so i only gave it one star    
Neg, some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others   almost as gifted   have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable    as was amply evident after basic instinct   sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon    rejecting her natural abilities   she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type    gloria is her latest disaster    babe ruth didn t quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity   and neither should stone reject what she does best    janeane garofalo   for example   is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone s part in basic instinct   neither is stone any less talented because she couldn t do garofalo s comedic roles    gloria   directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes   was not screened in advance for critics   almost always a sign that the studio isn t behind the picture    after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened   it is clear why they held it from the press    it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed    as the story opens   an angry gloria   stone   is being released from prison after 3 years confinement    she s got a bad attitude and a big mouth    she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents   a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast    an annoying child actor named jean luke figueroa plays a soon to be orphan named nicky    just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria s ex boyfriend kevin   jeremy northam     nicky s dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin s operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice       be a man     his father lectures him sternly       don t trust nobody    not no broads    nobody      most of the film s leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time and temperature announcements    add in the movie s almost non existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing   and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones    lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting    they stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse         say you re my baby     kevin coos demandingly       i m not gonna     gloria pouts back      the movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites    the kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared   no matter how many people are after him with guns   trying to kill him    and in one key scene   the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied    gloria   who keeps saying how she hates kids   takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys    think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends    if you don t know the answer   you may be just the right viewer for this film    you have to say this for stone   she can keep a straight face    when explaining life to a 7 year old kid   she says with utter seriousness     you got a lot of love making to make   you got a lot of boozing to do      gloria runs 1   48    it is rated r for profanity   violence and brief male nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers    
Pos, steven spielberg s   amistad     which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship   then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who   owned   them   is concerned with several different aspects of this story    first   the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery    second   it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case   including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams   anthony hopkins      last   and most importantly   it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade       amistad   succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements    i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another   anti slavery   movie    having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery   i doubted that there was much i didn t already know about it    fortunately   i turned out to be wrong    for one thing   spielberg s camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders  operations in africa   so   amistad   was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning    and some of the images here are   in fact   much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery    one scene in the middle   in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their   excess   slaves by throwing them overboard to drown   has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year    spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would   and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc 17 rating    the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians   such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain   whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time    exposing politicians as narrow minded   opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff   of course   but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation    the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time   such that john quincy adams   and probably other politicians like him     who clearly disapproved of the practice   was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court    the biggest success of   amistad   is probably the characterization of cinque   djimon hounsou     who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin   matthew mcconaughey     the lawyer who represents them in court    through cinque   we are given a window into the native culture   as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member   or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ    cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that   again   contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles       what kind of country is this   where laws  almost  work     he asks baldwin in bewilderment   when he learns that the case must be re tried before the supreme court    spielberg s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times   such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque s angry outburst in the court room    still   there isn t enough of this for it to be a serious problem    the main flaw in this film   which prevents it from earning four stars   is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can t quite handle all of these issues at the same time   so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie    this summer s contact   for example   dealt with several issues at once   but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and   most importantly   all of them were resolved at once       amistad   tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams   but it somehow feels a little forced   and in any case the speech itself   which lasts almost fifteen minutes   wears out its welcome about halfway through    perhaps the best way to describe it is this     amistad   is three four star films edited into one    almost every individual scene works   but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence   and thus is less than the sum of its parts    however   i can t honestly say how it could have been done differently   and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film   and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery    
Neg, the camera zooms in incredibly close    it focuses on the closed eyes of a person presumed dead    all of a sudden   with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse   his eyelids open    the camera zooms in incredibly close    it focuses on one of the characters desperately running for her life    then   with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse   she bumps into the killer    the camera zooms in incredibly close    it focuses on a door from where seemingly strange sounds emanate    all of a sudden   with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse   the doors swing open to reveal what s inside    close up thrill shots such as these seemed to elicit more laughter from the audience rather than genuine fear   which is a pretty good sign that you re not watching the thriller that the director had originally envisioned    rather   you adopt the opinion that the characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that they re in   that you stop caring about who lives   who dies and where the story goes    instead   you become more interested in how the characters get killed off    the four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs for this movie are helen and barry and julie and ray   two couples and dear friends to one another    during the summer just after high school graduation   they take a fateful drive down a dark mountain highway    suddenly   without warning   their car hits someone whom the teens presume was killed as a result of that collision    fearing jail time and possible manslaughter charges if they confess   they instead decide to dump the body into the ocean and make a pact never to discuss the episode again    a year goes by and things among the four friends begin to change    relationships fizzle   future dreams crumble   and attitudes change    but   they can not forget what they did    and apparently   neither can someone else    someone begins to send letters to all four of the teens with the frightening message     i know what you did last summer      the letter writer   a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a large metal hook   soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt down the four teens    it s now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer is before it s too late    while this movie has some nice visually eerie effects   too much of it s impact had to be generated with extreme close ups   while the level of suspense was choppy at best    there is so much more that this movie could have been   but decided to give us nothing but cheap thrills    it could have been a clever whodunit   but discovering who ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders    it could have explored the changed friendships after a year of adulthood   but seemed to only include that aspect to add 15 more minutes to the film    it could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you re alone and you see shadowy figures moving about   you don t walk towards them yelling   hello      once you yell   hello     you can expect an extreme close up   a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse    it s difficult to be in suspense when you know what s about to happen    the only redeeming aspect of the movie is that i now have a neat idea for a halloween costume   but i m not sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks    the horror that i experienced from this film is realizing that i actually went to see it    
Pos, the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year    we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics   loved by the people   and make tons of money at the box office    this year   the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic   the mummy    i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies   and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them    that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza    in the mummy   the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o connell    he teams up with a curious   clumsy librarian named evelyn   played by rachel weisz   to find the mysterious city of the dead   hamunaptra    evelyn loves egypt   and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable    rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle   and that s why she chose him to lead her there    also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn s brother   jonathan   played by john hannah   sliding doors      now in hamunaptra   the three uncover   the book of the dead      the curious evelyn unlocks the book   reads from it   and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep   arnold vosloo   becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book    along with imhotep arising from the dead   the ten curses of egypt become in full effect   launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra    not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him   he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt    don t expect huge things out of the mummy   but just expect to have a good time    this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects   which may turn off some viewers    on the other hand   this type of film is one of my favorites   but that s up to you to decide    there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though    the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world    we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert   swarms of beetles and locusts   and even creatures crawling under a human s skin    these may have been in other movies before   but not like in the mummy    as of now   the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year   but all this could change when star wars episode 1   the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country    in the past   brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles    when playing   george   in disney s george of the jungle   he was mainly not known by anyone    i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name   and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens    in the mummy   fraser gets to play an action hero   and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role   as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle    although brendan fraser is great   rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast    weisz really reminded me of a character from an old   horror film    the way she acts   looked   and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time    evelyn is probably the only character that was likable   considering that the other characters   like john hannah s   didn t get much personal attention    in many films   when different genres are mixed   the mixing usually works   and i like it for the most part    in the mummy though   not all of the mixing works    there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror   some with potential comedy   some with potential drama   and some with potential pure action   but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work    the mummy could have gotten an   a   rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these    i didn t mind the corny one liners here and there during action sequences   but it certainly could have done without them    the cinematography is amazing in the mummy    particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt   we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt   mummies   and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians    the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography    from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits   the costumes are always top notch    the bottom line  with the mummy   the summer is off to its usually great start    
Pos, tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently    the dalai lama has made speaking tours   tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops   the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months       kundun       presence     a name the monks call the young dalai lama   opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader    a group of monks enters a village and a two year old child catches their attention    the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as   mine      he and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country    he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950    the peaceful and isolated country is ill equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results    eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india    comparisons to   seven years in tibet   are inevitable    both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner s point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt       kundun   features only native actors and is more of an insider s story    in some ways   this makes this film a superior concept   but it lacks the movement and spark that made   seven years   such an audience pleaser    the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie   filmed in morocco for obvious reasons      the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer generated character    on an intellectual level   it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts    some events are depicted differently and pitt s austrian mountain climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama s life isn t even mentioned here    glossed over in   seven years     the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses   we were just about to change things   after the chinese attack    the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins    his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail    especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain    the visual treats more than make up for the movie s faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience    walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience    martin scorsese   known for his dark tales of the underworld     goodfellas       taxi driver       casino     has shifted gears    something of a thematic follow up to his   the last temptation of christ     this is his slowest film yet    oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese   most of these events take place off screen    his decision to not over explain rituals is commendable    the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon fed interpretations    philip glass s score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting    i talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again    hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india   i was struck by what was missing in the movie    as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is   there is a distance between the audience and the movie    the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings    with the exception of a few scenes   involvement with the characters is slight    one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama   shown as a mischievous boy who can t resist being a kid sometimes    an encounter with his older brother thubten j   norbu   a retired indiana university professor   who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment   but there aren t many of these    even with its problems   the   kundun   experience is phenomenal   but one that i fear most will miss    many people who saw   seven years in tibet   will have a   been there   done that   attitude    it s likely that the film will miss a wide spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping    
Pos, weir is well respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject matter into deceptively simple   powerful films   the mosquito coast   utopia   and fearless   post traumatic stress disorder   among them    in the truman show   weir essentially breathes life into the now tired concept of media manipulation by tackling the material from the inside out    it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top form playing the title character   truman burbank    by now you must be aware of the premise   unbeknownst to him   truman   carrey   is the star of his own tv series   a 24 7 peep show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations   people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants    `seahaven    his hometown   and the show itself   are the brainchild of christof   harris     who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon   directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras    for 30 years   truman suspects nothing `we accept the reality we re given     poses christof but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji    mcelhone   who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement   overwhelms him    thus   christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact   lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly rated program    in a few broad strokes   weir creates a convincing second reality   and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three quarters through    this allows us to comprehend and accept truman s world before we contextualize it    for all his madness   christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship   and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it    truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be   well   so darn nice   like a sibling   or   perhaps more appropriately   a caged animal in an interactive zoo     they want to see him succeed    the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey he really is an everyman here   abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible   wide eyed bewilderment    cinematically   the truman show is impeccable   stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images    as well   it employs wojciech kilar s piece   zycie za zycie  masterfully and beautifully    if the film has any flaws   one may find them in laura linney s characterization as meryl   truman s   wife     i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone     and in a subplot involving truman s `father    which feels curiously incomplete    there are a few stupendous sequences   and the film pulls off a wonderful trick   we become truman s audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film    they wear buttons asking `how will it end      i couldn t wait to know myself   though i didn t exactly want it to end   for this inspired movie is possibly the best and most complex summer picture in years    
Neg, 2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off    it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways    i m not going into much greater detail than that   since it would take forever to explain   and quite frankly   i m not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that i ve already wasted    while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction   2 days in the valley falls way short    this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello   james spader and jeff daniels    while the story isn t much   and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better   2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots    james spader s character   while not much better than the rest   is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way    and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron   in her first role      you know a movie isn t that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women    even if they are both gorgeous    i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted    but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result    while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting   they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about    if i were to put a number on it   only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch    this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent   and even then prepare for disappointment    not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again    or at least not all of it anyway    
Pos, carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven   robocop   came together to create the 1990 mega hit that is total recall    the film is a masterpiece of sets   action   and special effects    action and science fiction just don t get any better than this !  the story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid   arnold schwarzenegger   who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori   sharon stone      quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice   a brain implant   fake memory   of a two week vacation on mars    while being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaid s memory has previously been erased    now the people who did it are after him    quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead    the plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action   special effects   and twist after mind boggling twist    it grabs you and never lets go !  this film is a winner from beginning to end    the plot is superb   combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a rip roaring saga    schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever   and the supporting cast is good too    the action and stunts are terrific    the sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail    the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action    the make up effects by rob bottin   the howling   the thing   and robocop   are top notch   not to mention extremely outlandish    the visual effects by dream quest   the abyss   and industrial light and magic   star wars trilogy   jurassic park   and terminator 2   are phenomenal !  the visuals had such a state of the art   slickness   that they won an oscar    of course the film isn t always realistic   it s more fiction than science    for example   it is true that a body won t explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do    who cares    it s a movie    movies are supposed to entertain    and in my opinion this film achieves an entertainment level in film that is so terrific   it may be impossible to beat    
Pos, contact   pg   there s a moment late in robert zemeckis s contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place    we see a scientist   dressed in a silvery space suit   walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact   spherical space pod   unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops    anticipation   excitement   anxiety   fear  the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character   nervously   breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead    it is this sense of discovery   the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration   that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical   captivating entertainment    jodie foster stars as dr   ellie arroway   a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals    and i mean life  after losing her entire family when she was young   the only thing occupying ellie s world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth    after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers   ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega   which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport    from this synopsis   contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact   but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci fi hook    the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe   but perhaps more than anything else   contact is a character study of ellie   whose obsession with empirical   scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power    the irony is that   while admitting to having no religious faith   she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes   in a sense   a religion in its own right    it would be easy for scripters james v   hart and michael goldenberg   in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine   to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones   but they wisely eschew easy answers   giving equal time to both sides   and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane    in the end   there is no right or wrong   nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other   even slightly so  there are just two very viable points of view   each with their own merits   each with their own faults    the complex role of ellie is an actress s dream   and foster   a virtual shoo in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year   more than rises to the challenge    she conveys intelligence   determination   warmth   and   in a gutsy move   always on edge    we root for ellie and feel for her   but we also feel at times that she goes too far    contact is clearly foster s vehicle   but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles    matthew mcconaughey   who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role   holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie   spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss   however   his main storyline   the tentative palmer ellie romance   is the film s weakest subplot      john hurt is effectively creepy as s   r    hadden   the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding    angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine    most memorable of all   though   are tom skerritt and james woods   who play rival scientist dr   david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz   respectively   both   especially skerritt   embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances    zemeckis comes off of his three year break in top shape    always known as a director of effects laden extravaganzas   it comes as no surprise that contact s visual effects are quite stunning    the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001   a space odyssey   but with more advanced technology at his disposal   zemeckis s voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick s yet more wondrously pure    and zemeckis doesn t resist the urge to use the always interesting incorporate actors into existing film footage effect   which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump    effects   however   are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama   emotion   and pure wonder   which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump    it says a lot that   in a summer science fiction film such as this   it s not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised    the thought provoking   two hour plus contact is a much welcome change of pace from summer no brainers   but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn t entertaining    for all the interesting questions it asks   the film is still what it s being sold as     a journey to the heart of the universe      and what a fascinating   unforgettable journey it is    
Pos, historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s    for many critics   scholars and   most importantly   film producers   it was a thing of the past   something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black and white television and non cgi special effects    but in 1995   same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago   there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor   producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre    and   same as in the case of dances with wolves   he was awarded for his effort with   oscars      the name of the film was braveheart   and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson    the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace   1272   1305      in his time   english king edward i   longshanks     played by patrick mcgoohan   has almost completely subdued entire british isles   including scotland   whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by   ius primae noctis   and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights    although english had killed his father many years ago   young scottish commoner william wallace   played by mel gibson   doesn t care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron   played by catherine maccormack      murron s death changes that and wallace takes arms and   together with small but dedicated band of followers   begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country    through time   more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace s rag tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge    but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves   especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce   played by angus macfadyen     who wouldn t like to have a simple commoner as a national leader    braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson   so it wouldn t be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann    however   even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre    the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism    while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale like vision of picturesque castles   splendid costumes and knights in shining armour   gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard   short and brutish    this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle   where hand to hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details   never seen since verhoeven s ultra naturalistic flesh & blood    compared with this naturalistic approach   most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays    braveheart also employs humour at the right places   not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences   but also to underline its down to earth atmosphere   so different from previous historical epics    what makes braveheart   larger than life   is his protagonist    mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and   as a result   character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero    wallace is more than superior to his enemies   both physically and mentally   yet he is able to show his sensitive   more vulnerable side    naturally   when the character is based on epic poems   most of historical accuracy is going down the drain   which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s      however   even those who don t particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace   especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel   played by sophie marceau   and make her a child    because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended   and final scenes aren t as effective as they should be    mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful   and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors    most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan   whose cold   calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema    brendan gleeson   who would later become famous for his role in boorman s general   is also very good as wallace s trusted companion   as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy stricken king john balliol    david o harra is very entertaining as wallace s irish ally   and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience stricken character of robert the bruce    women in this film have rather thankless roles   especially marceau as one dimensional french princess    catherine mccormack as wallace s wife was more interesting   but she was eliminated from the picture early on    from the technical point of view   the film is also very good    photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen    on the other hand   the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern day instruments for period piece set in medieval times    although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike   braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism    the main reason for that was the fact that gibson   among many historical facts   chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of   longshank    s son prince edward   played by peter hanly      he is not only presented as a villain   but also as one of the less competent in villain s camp   and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in   politically correct   hollywood    to make things even more obvious   good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward   rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives  common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals    however   although the message of this film might look right wing   it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century    according to that ideology   oppressed classes   workers   peasants   are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and   as such   they are more radical   less willing to make compromises and more efficient   on the other hand   privileged classes   aristocracy   bourgeoisie   are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges    this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety    in the end   whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic   braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre    
Pos, i feel no hesitation in saying that   there s something about mary   is the best film that i will see all year    from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture   there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998    it is that good of a film    when gene siskel said this about   fargo   only a few months into  96   i dismissed the notion as ridiculous    how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it    but after seeing the farrelly s hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork   i now know what siskel was talking about    once in a   very great   while   a film comes along that is so daring   so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end   you just want to stand up and cheer    and you know   at that instant   that you have just experienced something very special    now for the shocker     mary   is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed     pink flamingos   obviously notwithstanding      the movie is so rude and   i guess   inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents   luckily i had seen it before them   so i could warn the about what they were in for      forget   blazing saddles       animal house   and even the former king of gross out comedy     monty python s meaning of life     they were all only preludes to the farrelly s assault on the senses    in fact   this may even be the funniest film i ve ever had the pleasure of seeing   the only real contender is   monty python and the holy grail       and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade    but as funny as it is   something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of   mary     it has a huge heart    you see   the farrelly s are truly gifted filmmakers    they don t just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes   although there are plenty to go around      they also   very wisely   add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses    it s funny   though    if you just look at an outline of the story   it seems kind of contrived and predictable    but believe me   it is anything but    ben stiller plays ted   a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe   mary   cameron diaz      after he sticks up for her retarded brother   warren   w    early brown   the cameraman   believe it or not   from   scream       his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom    in one of the film s funniest scenes   something goes wrong   i won t ruin it for those who know nothing about the film   and ted is unable to face mary ever again    jump to the present    after years of self loathing   ted finally hires private detective pat healy   a suitably slimy matt dillon   to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school    healy finds that mary is still a full blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself    admittingly   the basic story line leaves a little to be desired    after all   with a not really all that funny premise   how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours    somehow   the farrelly s pull it off    the performances here are also right on target    as ted   stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating   as he would normally be   but very lovable    and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons   but the actor who really grabs your attention is w   earl brown as mary s brother    no other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here    i know he won t be nominated   but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february    as good as the actors are   though   it s the directors  movie all the way    i guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year   you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg s wwii epic   saving private ryan      and yes   that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting    but which is harder   making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can t breath for minutes at a time    i ll let you decide that one for yourself   but this critic is sticking to his guns    there is just something about   mary      
Pos, i guess it s a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating   comedy   of chris tucker    i m a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium   and this movie lets him not only do his impressive as ever martial arts schtick   but show off his comic timing as well    it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title    the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects    this time around   the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan   john lone     who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states   i m still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that   is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones        the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns    of course   it s up to hong kong detective lee   chan   and trash talking lapd detective james carter   tucker   to take the bad guys out and the authorities   to the extent that they even exist   stay out of their way    rush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that here it s carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out    i guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan    he refuses to shut up    not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head   but his jokes just aren t funny   a pathetic mixture of sub par eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock white man black man jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny    i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates   but didn t anyone realize how irritating tucker s incessant ranting and raving was    if this is all the comedian has to offer then i don t care to see any more of his films    fortunately   chan makes for a marvelous straight man   and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely    it s not often that one actor can so completely save a movie   but there is no other name for what he does   whenever he s on screen   rush hour 2 comes to nearly breathtaking   often hilarious   life    much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a   player     but who cares    i can think of few high concepts that are funnier    the movie ends with outtakes that   as usual   show that chan isn t perfect   and that it does   indeed   take him a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless    chris tucker botches some lines as well   and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie    a lot of people have pointed out rush hour 2 isn t very different from its predecessor in tone or style    but i liked the original   and i like the sequel   though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it    director brett ratner   the family man   keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes   i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works      it s not great jackie chan   but it s jackie chan   and that s enough    up next   jay and silent bob strike back  
Pos, i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night    i went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success   personal growth and insightful humor about life    i came away somewhat disappointed in this regard   getting some of the latter and not much of the former    the basic plot revolves around billy crystal   who plays mitch robbins   turning forty    he s now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original    he s given a job at the radio station to his best friend   played by daniel stern   out of sympathy while stern s character works through his divorce    his loser younger brother   john lovitz   comes to mitch s house to bum a money and place to live   all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday    during the celebration   mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curly s   the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance   old hat    after a business trip to las vegas   crystal   stern   and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure    on the way   they run into curly s twin brother   duke   played by   you know who   jack palance    first of all   the cinematography was beautifully done   especially the outdoor scenes in the desert    the scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself    there is some character development during the film    the actors remain true to their characters and play them well   without overplaying the jokes    the movie is a good basic adventure   with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict    the movie is paced well   but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end    humor wise   the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film    there are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake   but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel   surprise   surprise for a sequel   right        however   the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film s manipulation of the audience    the film tries to pull your heart strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other   like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend s butt    this is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original    there were also some parts which appeared unrealistic   like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn t worry more about water while tromping around the desert    some strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here    since the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich   unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original     i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey    overall   i d say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some story line deficiencies making it less worthy than the original    it may be worth the full price of admission   but a matinee would be a better bargain    
Neg, i think of i know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream 2 could have been    mind you   though   i mean this in the worst possible way    i know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the scream s    as a result   it s even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures   see nightmare on elm street   because it thinks it s about thirty times smarter than it is    based on a teen book of the same name and   disappointingly   adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson   i know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top    the appropriate mood being set   this is angst horror for the 90 s     we cut over to the july 4th parade in a small north carolina town    from there   we see the blond   female protagonist   helen shivers   woodenly played by sarah michelle geller     getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male   hero     barry cox   woodenly played by ryan phillipe     and matched brunette pair of protagonists   julie james and ray bronson   woodenly played by party of five s jennifer love hewitt and freddie prinze jr     respectively   cheer her on    after getting drunk at a party   going to a beach to wittily discuss urban legend and indulge in some foreshadowing   and having some meaningful sex   if you believe what the characters say     the four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night    his face is mangled so they can t tell who it is   and they come to the decision to dump him in the ocean so as to not ruin any of their future chances for success in the world    cut to one year later    the lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad    main brunette female   the bright one of the bunch   has been plagued with guilt and almost failed out of college    blond female has forfeited her dreams of starring on guiding light   and now works at the family store in town    brunette male is a fisherman   living off the land    blond male has become a complete jerk and quarterback on some college football team    then   predictably   their past comes back to haunt them    it all begins with an irrational murder   followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer   bad acting by a good actress   anne heche     an improbable plot   bad acting by the main bad actors   some more killing   concluding in a climactic scene   mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie    all the while   the actors and actresses spout off bad lines   and main brunette male does his best keanu reeves imitation    not that the movie was without pleasure    count the illogical plot twists and bad lines for some fun    mostly   though   note the costumes of main females and how trendily unattractive they make the otherwise eye catching pair look    
Neg, it s a good thing most animated sci fi movies come from japan   because   titan a   e     is proof that hollywood doesn t have a clue how to do it    i don t know what this film is supposed to be about    from what i can tell it s about a young man named kale who s one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and re generating what is left of the human race    that s a fine premise for an action packed sci fi animated movie   but there s no payoff    the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil   dredge   aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason    so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights   fistfights   blaster fights and more double crosses than you can shake a stick at    there s so much pointless sci fi banter it s too much to take    the galaxy here is a total rip off of the   star wars   universe the creators don t bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing   the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring    despite the fantastic animation and special effects   it s just not an interesting movie    
Pos, once again   the battle is dreamworks versus disney   earlier this year   the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end of the world asteroid flicks   deep impact and armageddon    here we are now   just a few months later   and they re at it again with dueling bug movies   antz and a bug s life    what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution    i mean   come on    what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer animated films about bugs    as was the case with the meteor movies   disney has come out on top   though antz is a likable movie   a bug s life is far superior    in fact   this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz   i became immersed in the world of a bug s life   while antz just made me scrutinize everything    but it s not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison    a bug s life is a remarkable film in its own right   and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer animated film about bugs    in fact   it s one of the best films this year   it s smart   subtle   and funny   but it s also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining    i haven t had such a good time at the movies in months    it tells the story of an ant named flick   voice by dave foley     he s a nice guy   but he s also a troublemaker    the ants spend all season putting together the offering   a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers    just before the grasshoppers come   flick accidentally knocks over the offering   and ruins everything for the entire colony   the grasshopper s leader   hopper   kevin spacey     is enraged   and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer   or they re all dead    flick   feeling responsible for this   sets off to look for help    he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them    he heads to the city   the city being a house a few miles away     where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs   a ladybug   denis leary   who is spectacular     a black widow   bonnie hunt     a caterpillar   joe ranft     a butterfly   madeline kahn     a rhinoceros beetle   michael mcshane     and a stick   david hyde pierce   also giving a hilarious performance      flick doesn t know they re actors   and they don t know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers   so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position    the most obvious element of a bug s life is the quality of animation    created by pixar   the same people who brought us toy story   a bug s life has some of the most amazing visuals i ve ever seen    the bugs seem to inhabit a three dimensional space   and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action    this is a lush   colorful world   full of life and imagination   the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives   matches   bottlecaps   tin cans   etc     and make them active objects in the bugs  world is innovative    the film is also mercilessly exciting   particularly in a superbly staged scene involving our heroes  escape from a bird   a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening      but the makers of a bug s life know where the importance lies   story and characters    flick   with solid voice work from foley   is a great guy to lead the story    but the real treat comes with the circus bugs   they re such a likable group of characters    the standouts are the stick   hyde pierce is so good     francis the ladybug   and the big fat caterpillar    all of these bugs have more than a token personality   which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs   and it also keeps the tear jerking scenes from seeming obligatory    in my review of antz   i said that the film is a clever cop out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant like existence    in concept   a bug s life is basically the same movie   except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn t like about it    with such strong work in both animation and script   a bug s life is nothing but a joy to sit through    it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie   but a bug s life is so good that i m sure it will find its audience    after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies   it s downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty    
Neg, susan granger s review of   mulholland drive     universal focus    whatever david lynch is selling   i m not buying    from the writer/director of   blue velvet   and   twin peaks   comes another dark   mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive   the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills    dazed   a beautiful brunette   laura elena harring   emerges and stumbles down a hill   slipping unobserved into a  30s style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip    the next morning   a dewy blonde   naomi watts   from deep river   ontario   arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase    her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet    the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust    meanwhile   a hotshot director   justin theroux     whose wife is in bed with the poolman   is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there s an assassin   mark pellegrino   roaming the city    the tortuous paths of these various characters   and others named cookie   coco and cowboy   intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because   midway through the story   lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality   leaving a huge wad of cash   a blue metallic key   a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered    elena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses   effectively making the subtle switch    the same cannot be said for former m   g   m    dancer ann miller who s stiff and self conscious   speaking   like most lynch players   in staccato tones    on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10     mulholland drive   is a frenzied   frustrating 4   originally designed as an episodic tv pilot   this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out    
Neg, synopsis   big breasted and dim witted sculptress britt gets really mad at her grad student boyfriend because he spends too much time on his thought transference experiments instead of her art showings    elderly   evil scientist everett longstreet switches minds with britt s boy   in the meantime   and goes completely mental    comments   naked souls opens with a naked woman   and the movie makes no illusion that it s a sci fi vehicle designed to show pamela anderson s   um   talents    if you are really interested in seeing anderson s talents   however   i suggest you skip over this dud and watch the infamous pam and tommy lee honeymoon sex tape   now available on home video    at least with that   movie     you don t have to go through the painful experience of watching pamela try to pronounce multiple syllable words like   eclectic      a premise does exist in the movie    basically   while anderson wears skimpy clothes which barely contain her talents   she practices her art    brilliantly slapping plaster of paris on naked women    her boyfriend   meanwhile   spends 20 hours a day in a morgue trying to view the memories of dead prison inmates because this will   make a difference to humanity      whatever    the movie fails to explain how these two hooked up    be grateful    after we meet the evil everett longstreet   lots of technobabble and mystical mumbo jumbo get tossed about   pammy has sex replete with cheesy make out music   and minds get transferred    never fear   though   pammy uses her sharp mental abilities   ahem   to save her boyfriend in the end    unfortunately   no one saves the movie    avoid this would be sci fi thriller   unless you re in for a good laugh or two    
Pos, the rocky horror picture show  special edition    1975    starring   tim curry and susan sarandon  cult films are never mainstream    the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused   yelling out  what the hell is that        fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the  hidden jokes  they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like they re insane    the rocky horror picture show   recently re released in a  special edition  to video   is the mother of all cult films    period    like some other cult films   most notably little shop of horrors   the rocky horror picture show is a musical with a twisted edge to it    this movie begins out innocently enough  a couple get engaged at a friend s wedding and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while it s raining    they go to a castle to try to use the phone    little do they know that the castle is owned by dr   frank n   furter   a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use for personal reasons    the acting is pretty good overall    tim curry   home alone 2   legend   is over the top as frank n   furter    it s interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandon s   dead man walking   first film  she plays janet   the girlfriend of brad majors    even the singer meatloaf is in it ! !  the songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way    a sampling of titles range from damn it   janet to touch a touch a touch a touch me    all the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors  kind of a bad thing    barry bostwick   brad majors   tries to sing as does susan sarandon   but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience    meatloaf sings like meatloaf    the new special edition contains two original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the original version    sadly   the songs are tacked after the credits  kind of defeats the purpose    if you want to see a different film   watch this one ! !  
Pos, there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie    action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences   while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full circle    for fans of both genres   however   realism is key    action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic   and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie s end    on this advice   director john frankenheimer   the island of dr    moreau   strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller   ronin    the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing   considering the fare that s fallen into the same category over the last few years    the script   written by j   d   zeik in his big screen debut   approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission   impossible two years ago    a certain number of people will be lost by this   but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times    frankenheimer masters the script with poise   and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck    his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here   and ronin becomes a better movie because of it    robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time    he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex spy sam   a man who s called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre   natascha mcelhone   recover a package    the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast   especially once the requisite double crossing begins   and its role is skillfully penned by zeik    at times   however   zeik s tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission   impossible   de niro might easily become tom cruise   the package might become cruise s computer disk    fortunately   the focus here is almost entirely on the package   whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double cross and why it happened    the action content is impressive   and it lives up to the hints given in previews    the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness    ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish   but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots    the suspense tapers off considerably by the end   a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie s open    considering these factors it s good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well   and it s another good bet this month    since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months   it s definitely worth the visit    
Neg, there was probably a good reason that the warner bros   studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened    and   after seeing this piece of toxic waste   i now know why    this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago    fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god s country   somewhere in eastern kentucky    it s beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate   kris kristopherson   who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role      it turns out that he s filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit    seagal plays jack taggert   an aikido versed   fighting machine   who is an agent with the epa    no       not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa    it s the environmental protection agency    i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers !  taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice    written by someone named jeb   i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships   banjo picking preachers   and dumb as nails rednecks    but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in    seagal s idea of a disguise is a long length $1000 leather jacket    but to get closer to the kinfolk   he will fix people s porches for free    that s another great epa asset   teaching agents how to fix porches    slow and plodding   this project is a total mess    the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige    here   his bravado basically turns into bullyness    townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued    fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever    and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes    the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony   gets behind the pulpit   and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment    but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping   kristopherson   meets up with seagal    kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away    seagal gallantly replies     i ll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth      i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background    this is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal s righteousness and narcissistic arrogance    seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace   that of the enviro thriller   on deadly ground      however   the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this    still   i believe in preserving mother earth   so save your $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity    
Neg, this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney s live  action george of the jungle    tarzan and the lost city   the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough s legendary hero to the big screen   is one of the most inept and ill timed of any tarzan adventure so far    badly conceived and poorly executed   tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves    i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan   it s not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie    furthermore   it s even more curious that this film is rated pg   which   by definition   rules out any sex or explicit violence    and   while i m not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story   tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production    of course   no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city   since the film s troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line    imagine george of the jungle stripped of all   intentional   humor   and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like    with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences   the film barely registers a pulse    anyone in search of a relatively entertaining   family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book   which uses the same basic elements to much better effect    the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery   which   unfortunately   includes the two lead actors      the film doesn t attempt to re tell the origin story   the thinking is that it has been done often enough    instead   tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a   k   a   john clayton a   k   a   tarzan the ape man   casper van dien   several days before his marriage to lady jane porter   jane march      he is living happily in england   enjoying the benefits of being a land owning noble    meanwhile   in central africa   the dastardly nigel ravens   steven waddington     a self proclaimed scholar and explorer   believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar   which he calls the cradle of civilization    on the way there   he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things   like burning native villages   to earn the wrath of the locals    one shaman   determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal   sends a mystical message to tarzan for help    with lady jane following close behind   he returns to the jungle where he was born    its patently obvious that casper van dien   one of the pretty boy heroes of starship troopers   was not hired on the basis of his acting ability    with his plastic facial expressions   monotone voice   and complete inability to make convincing animal noises   his range rivals that of steven seagal    his pecs   however   are impressive   and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off    jane march   on the other hand   has to keep her shirt on   which may be a first for her    some six years ago   march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud s steamy the lover    since then   she made the career killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night   which exploited her every acting defiency    tarzan continues this trend    march may be attractive   but   at least judging by this performance   she can t act    meanwhile   steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy    instead   he turns out to be little more than a nuisance    the story line is pure formula   which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies    the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless    the romantic elements are all contrived   in fact   lady jane s presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance    the special effects are truly bottom of the barrel   including some laughably bad men in ape costumes   apparently   animatronics were too expensive for this production      and   of course   as with all jungle movies   there are the obligatory cute animals    over the years   the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material    the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller   but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part   including gordon scott   who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role      weismuller made 12 tarzan features   van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number    and   having seen tarzan and the lost city   i would argue that the movie going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12    
Pos, when andy leaves for cowboy camp   his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys    one of these toys is wheezy   a penguin with a broken squeaker    woody   tom hanks   saddles up andy s dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy    woody succeeds in his mission   but doesn t make it back to the house before al   the unscrupulous owner of al s toy barn   recognizes woody as a rare collector s item and steals him    buzz lightyear   tim allen   leads hamm   john ratzenberger     mr   potato head   don rickles     slinky dog   jim varney     and rex   wallace shawn   into the city to find their friend    meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped    al has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950 s tv puppet show   woody s round up   except for a woody doll    now that the collection is complete   al plans to sell woody and his round up gang bullseye the horse   jessie the cowgirl   joan cusack     and stinky pete the old prospector   kelsey grammer    to a toy museum in japan    the gang is happy about the move   they ve been in storage for years waiting for woody    if woody doesn t go with them   they ll be closed up in a dark box again   possibly forever    trying to convince him to stay with them   jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up   and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered    while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy   buzz and the boys invade al s toy barn   where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn t know he s a toy    the new buzz generates the movie s biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on   zurg s fortress     i   e     al s apartment building      the original   toy story   won me over because its central themes reflected a grown up sensibility rather than the usual this is what we think kids want to hear    while most kids  movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill   in   toy story   buzz discovered that he wasn t special   that he was just like everyone else    buzz sank into a suicidal depression   but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy    in other words   it s okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life    most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we re not space rangers and we re never going to be       toy story 2   addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie    woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded   abandoned   or sealed up in a dark box in the attic    this is another big grown up theme   everything ends    the theme is introduced early in the movie when woody s arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp    on the shelf   woody meets wheezy   who s dusty   broken   and forgotten    the other toys are shocked that woody has been   shelved     and they worry that woody s ride out to the 25 cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt    after he s stolen   woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals    of course   in spite of the heavy themes   toy story 2   explores   it s also very funny    most of the laughs come from the toys  assault on al s toy barn and on the apartment building    the brief substitution of a new   still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise   i d wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original    most of the vocal performances are first rate    tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work    however   one voice over also stands out as horribly miscast    kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector    although he does a lot of voice over work in commercials and on   the simpsons     as sideshow bob     grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice    he doesn t have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete    the animation is even better than in the first    especially impressive were the textures of the figures    we can now see the difference between flesh and plastic   in the first movie the people looked just like the toys   but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint    we can also see that bo peep is porcelain    as you can tell from the long winded phrasing common in the merchandising      disney and pixar s  toy story 2       this is pixar s coming out party    to celebrate they appended their first project   a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball   to the beginning of the movie    they made the short in 1986   which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then    on the downside     toy story 2   follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale   and some sections tend to drag    overall   though   i had a great time and found   story 2   to be a worthy successor to the first   toy story      bottom line   this one really is fun for the whole family !  
Neg, wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions    over black and white drawings   we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange   sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation induced mutation    the   original   inhabitants of the earth   fairies and elves   return to populate the globe   along with their evil   mutant counterparts    one day   and i say   one day   not to be trite   but because that s exactly how it happened   no advance notice     a fairy queen gives birth to twins   one good and one evil    the twins grow up to be powerful wizards   the good one embracing magic   and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire    we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology    as unoriginal as the premise is   i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out    there s a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world   after all    i soon learned   however   that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film    once the transition was made from still art to color animation   an entirely different feel takes precedence    rather than the epic saga promised by the narration   we get a goofy looking world of a saturday morning cartoon    not just the look   mind you   but all the zany sounds like >honk boing  for years   blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good   since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined    however   blackwolf now has a secret weapon   nazis    yup   adolf hitler   the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht    okay   not the real things   but an archival film his minions dug up    projected into the sky for all to see   it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up    before you know it   there are dead elves everywhere    this is just as well    the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn t care about any of them    they re either silly   sappy   or both    the dialog gets much of the credit for this    an example is when avatar nonchalantly says     well   looks like my brother and i begin our final battle      not very formidable when he s also the guy who says     this is the biggest bummer of a trip i ve ever been on      my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can t fight back against the nazi charged evil    her response is     they have weapons and technology    we just have love      suffice to say   the characters are strictly two dimensional   and we therefore don t expect anything more than the obvious to happen    which it does    the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out   which is anticlimactic and disappointing    please note that it is the action that is unexpected    that it is disappointing is not    the film couldn t settle on a particular mood    it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle    scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity    the dramatics   which seem to occur at random   are overly staged and overly acted   detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned    ralph bakshi   the director   makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film   hitler and the nazis were bad    so who doesn t know this already    well   maybe children    okay   so you might say that this is a movie for children    it s not    in the scenes where good fights evil   there s a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they re watching a cartoon    so is the film for adults    if so   we probably don t need to be bashed over the head to get the point    why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know    wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes   and hitler giving speeches    however   we don t see any reason why they should be considered bad    we see no atrocities being committed   not even any real battle footage    there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich   and we re not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place    this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made   since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment    i d like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere   at any time   and we must therefore be vigilant    however   i m not sure if i want to give him that much credit    
Neg,    houston   we have a serious problem      after making   mission   impossible     brian de palma has a lot to live up to    by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew   he hopes to reach the modern audience    and the possibilities are certainly there   but the result is a great disaster    starting in a near future   with a prologue copied from   apollo 13     de palma slowly builds up his   story      the human race has already set foot on mars    a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened    this is basically the whole plot    so it s hard to imagine that it can be stretched to 2 hours    but de palma manages to do that    it is not a very good achievement    as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space   the hardest thing to do is stay awake    the film s major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is    david mamet s dialogue   while trying to seem natural   is distant and simply fake    de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot    the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick s   2001   a space odyssey       apollo 13   and   godzilla      to make time pass   the creators have inserted several   refreshing   scientific details   that would not convince a half crazed frog    it consists of multiple copies and direct ripp offs from several great science fiction films and stories    when it finally presents an almost original idea   it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity    i can t even call this film predictable   since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this    sometimes it gets so cheesy   that you ll start laughing when you re supposed to cry and cry when you re supposed to laugh    you ll see enormous sandstorms   hear mysterious sounds and   last but not least   on this   constantly surprising   tour you ll see    an alien    it s really hard to find comparisons to such an experience   and i know that i ve never said that before   i thought i never would     but   lost in space   is actually better    that s an achievement in itself !  director brian de palma has stroke gold with   untouchables   that became an instant american classic    it is for this film that he will be remembered   while all his other failures will be forgotten    he ll live to fight another day !  i send the actors my condolences   since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters    and both the cinematography   production design and art direction are very decent    it is because of the achievement of 254 people   that i rate this film 2/10    unfortunately their hard work was in vain    if you have problems with insomnia   i recommend you this film    if you re not asleep within the first half hour   consult your doctor    
Pos,    when it s cold   molecules aren t moving    everything is clean      these are the essential words of mikey carver   elijah wood     a young teenage boy living in 1973 new canaan   connecticut in the ice storm    when mikey delivers these words to a bored science class   it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikey s life and the lives that surround him    his father jim   jamey sheridan   is rarely seen and his mother janey   sigourney weaver   is having an affair with married neighbor ben hood   kevin kline      ben s wife elena   joan allen   suspects the affair   but doesn t say anything    meanwhile   ben s 14 year old daughter wendy   christina ricci   continuously lures mikey and his younger brother sandy   adam hann byrd   into sexual explorations    tobey maguire plays paul hood   the 16 year old narrator of the story who also happens to be the least prevalent character    we start the film with an interesting outlook on family from paul    he compares family to the fantastic four comic book   and even goes so far as to say that family is everybody s own anti matter   something everybody will return to eventually   and the farther you go   the deeper you ll return    the ice storm is a character piece that explores a dismal time both in america   and in the individual lives portrayed in the movie    everything parallels everything else    the young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs   sex   and alcohol is really almost identical to the parents trying to figure out the purpose in their own lives using the same methods       when it s cold outside   the molecules aren t moving    everything is clean      everything is clean because nobody will admit what s going on    even the president is on tv denying his wrong doings    how can you expect anything more out of a couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution    all the sex and drugs is so obviously empty   and i think that s the point of the film    at first viewing   the entire movie might seem empty   but then why shouldn t it parallel itself    you don t get to know the characters very deeply   but i think that s because nobody in the movie knows each other either    we sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another    at first glance   you might think emotion is lost in the ending scenes because you haven t gotten to know the characters well enough to sympathize   then you realize that just might be the point   and then you do feel the pain    the acting by all is quite good   but i particularly liked elijah wood    he doesn t seem to be receiving as much recognition as the others   but i still found him to possess quite a real sense of being    christina ricci is being acclaimed for her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more to her life in the pants of every available boy    still   i say hats off remain to wood   joan allen s subtle but believable performance as a lonely   unappreciated wife   and the always excellent kevin kline    tobey maguire did a fine job   but his character which   perhaps   was the most intact   sensible person in the story   seemed a little lost    he was needed   but perhaps he should ve been used more    the ice storm is being hailed by many as one of the best films of the year    i hate to say that i don t agree   but i don t    in fact   i can think of many other films that i would rank higher than this one    even so   it is a very good film    it takes a lot of retrospect to fully appreciate it s art   but when you finally start seeing things in it that you didn t before   you start to grow even fonder of the characters and the story    perhaps this is one to see   ponder   and then watch again with different eyes    
Neg, a number of critics have decided that it s open season on freddie prize jr     slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound alike   disposable teen fluff like   head over heels       boys and girls       down to you   and   she s all that      while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend   his talent is not    i first saw him in the independent dark comedy   the house of yes     where he gave a subtle   impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america s freakiest families    prinze has the acting chops   he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown up movies to show the non believers that he has what it takes       summer catch   certainly won t help his case    inoffensive   but utterly generic   the baseball related romantic comedy does little more than kill time    the story deals with the love affair between tenley   jessica biel     a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan   prinze     a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a big time baseball star    ryan s preoccupation with his new honey bunny drives her elitist father   bruce davison   crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team    it s a wonder the kid has any time to pitch   as his time is occupied with making out with tenley   fighting with her dad   bonding with his own dad   fred ward   who deserves better than this     fighting with his brother   jason gedrick   and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates    the filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky   character heavy baseball movie like   bull durham     but haven t got a clue how to get there    and so they glide from one clich   to the next for 108 minutes    the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a center fielder from texas    in an early barroom scene   blucas   best known as demon fighting riley finn from   buffy the vampire slayer     hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass   then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states     he does have a nice ass    a bubble butt      when lillard gives him an   are you insane      look   blucas calmly says     it s nothing sexual     then goes on to evaluate the hind ends of some other players   including lillard s    speaking of asses   prinze does not bare his in the movie    the actor has a no nudity clause in his contract   so two stunt butts were employed for a couple of semi nude shots    blucas   whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story   gets another unique moment late in the film    sick of hearing teammates make   fat chick   jokes   he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amply sized ladies    while his speech still ends up objectifying women   it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie    trivial tidbit     summer catch   marks a scooby doo summit    marc blucas appears in   jay and silent bob strike back   as fred from the scooby doo gang   while freddie prinze jr   plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon    
Neg, an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis  1981 feature   an american werewolf in london    where the original had comedy   the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit coms    where the first installment had chills   this one has sequences that are inappropriately   unintentionally funny    in short   while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre   the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax   it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity      the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans    andy   tom everett scott     brad   vince vieluf     and chris   phil buckman      sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping    soon they have company in the person of serafine   julie delpy     who has decided to end it all    she jumps   but andy   with a bungee cord attached   goes after her   and manages to save her   at the price of a major headache      serafine disappears   but a smitten andy seeks her out    however   once he learns his would be girlfriend s dark secret   he wishes he hadn t    she s a werewolf   cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full   and   to make matters worse   he has suffered a nasty bite himself    actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie    she imbues serafine with spirit   spunk   and humanity   which gives us an emotional stake in the character s fate    this isn t necessarily a good thing   since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless   campy entertainment experience    delpy s injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her    delpy s previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski s white and richard linklater s before sunrise    she was radiant   charismatic   and effective in both    given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here   she gets as close as possible to those adjectives    it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris   but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss    and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff   check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice    those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts    the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy    which is to say   they give performances appropriate for the screenplay    tom everett scott   that thing you do   plays the lead like he s in a made for tv movie    it would be kind to call him bland    actors vince vieluf and phil buckman   as andy s friends   are no more impressive    julie bowen   happy gilmore   is suitably fetching as werewolf meat    and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal    on the technical side   it s all bad news    the computer generated werewolves look painfully unreal    the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits    repeated use is made of the   werewolf cam     an infrared wolf s point of view approach that s interesting the first couple of times it s employed   then becomes tedious    and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on screen action they re matched to    director anthony waller   who displayed a confident   edgy style in mute witness   stumbles with this material   never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel    as a result   we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii   your sister is a werewolf       i will give waller credit for killing off a dog   though    something that s rarely seen in movies these days     an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a   bad movie   sort of way   but that s a dubious distinction    ultimately   it s an unfortunate effort   for   while it isn t unbearable to sit through   it isn t a howl   either    
Pos, bruce willis is a type casted actor    in die hard   he played john mcclaine   a rough and tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time    again   in pulp fiction   as butch coolidge   an over the hill boxer   he steps on the wrong guys toes    in luc besson s the fifth element   willis plays korben dallas   a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time    a stylish science fiction epic   the fifth element s complex plot begins right away   in the deserts of egypt   think stargate   in 1914    an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the   5 elements   are stored and takes them away   vowing to return them when the evil comes back    cut to present day   which is our future    the year is 2023   and new york is the city    the only basic differences between besson s futuristic depiction and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker   the buildings are higher   and the traffic floats !  anyway   the   evil   comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth   so back come the tortoise like aliens to return the   5 elements   to earth   in order to defend themselves against the   evil      in the process   however   the ship is intercepted by 2 fighter pods and is destroyed before landing    when officials arrive at the site   all that remains is a hand    what can you do with a hand    hey   its the 21st century here dna reconstruction !  this hand turns out to belong to a beautiful   but mysterious woman named leeloo   milla jovovich   dazed and confused      she escapes and   attempting to escape the police by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper and crashing through the roof of korben s floating cab    it s love at first site   as korben and leeloo elude the lazy as always cops    when leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius   ian holm   night falls on manhattan     korben searches the   yellow pages   and delivers her to the door of the good reverend   the only man who knows of her background and duties    now   korben   leeloo   and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship   special effects were spectacular here   to find the remaining four elements    it is here   where they discover that they have been followed by the evil jean baptiste emmanuel zorg   gary oldman   murder in the first      he   too   wants possession of the elements   as do a group of pig like warriors   think the gamorreans in return of the jedi      in a spectacular ending   with time running out   leeloo is faced with a problem why should she save a people who live to destroy each other    the question is a good one   and one that could be pondered    but enough of that    when korben points out his love for her   leeloo is inclined to become the   5th element   and save the world from total destruction    the fifth element features good performances by willis and holm   an excellent portrayal of a comedic villain   who reminded me a lot of jack nicholson s the joker in batman   by one of the masters of villainy   oldman   and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich    the supporting cast   which includes brion james   tango & cash     tim   tiny   lester   no holds barred     luke perry   buffy the vampire slayer     and chris tucker   friday     added a comedic effect to the film    although besson s the fifth element can be criticized for the outlandish use of cliches   it is a solid motion picture with a definite point    some other directors   like anaconda s luis llosa   should take a lesson from this guy using ideas from epic motion pictures the right way    ideas from star wars and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film    sci fi fan or not   any movie lover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture        
Pos, confession time   i have never   ever seen gone with the wind    i don t know why   really    haven t wanted to check it out on video   haven t been at home the nights it was on network tv   and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big screen    so right up front   i ll admit that i don t know what the heck i m talking about   but here goes        is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990 s    maybe that s going a little bit too far    as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie   they re no clark gable and vivien leigh    but        the parallels are there    gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available    technicolor    titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors    gwtw places america s greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story   titanic does the same with the atlantic s most legendary tragedy    they both have strong willed redheaded heroines   they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves/steerage bums   they were both incredibly expensive and popular        ok   maybe that s not enough parallels    so titanic s not in gwtw s league    no matter    titanic is a great movie in its own right   complete with spills   thrills and   especially   chills    much has been made of the humongous cost of the production   and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again    the money was obviously well spent    the costumes look great   the sets look great   the cgi graphics look great    i especially liked the expensive little touches   like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks    but writer/director/producer james cameron s real challenge in writing/directing/ producing titanic wasn t just costuming and set design and special effects    cameron s major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in    he succeeds masterfully    cameron does two things that work incredibly well    first   he shows us modern day salvage operations on titanic   that s just   titanic     not   the titanic     mind you      the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state   corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic   from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett   bill paxton      television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101 year old rose calvert   gloria stuart     who survived the wreck in 1912    stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role   narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew    secondly   cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character   and the romantic triangle between rose   winslet     her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley   billy zane   and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon   dicaprio      the way that big budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all star cast   so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people    cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack   while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board    the supporting cast is professional   but mostly anonymous    other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown   there s no moment when you stop and say   oh   yeah   i know him   what s he been in       although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform   or even as the ill fated engineer      the love story itself is rather conventional    i think some reviewers found it weak   and that may be a fair criticism    the performances are the key here    zane has the meatiest part in the movie   and he plays the arrogant   condescending steel millionaire to the hilt    he s smooth   he looks great in a tuxedo   and he s a convincing enough jerk that the winslet dicaprio relationship looks plausible    at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat   you can hear the wheels in his mind turning   saying not   can i save this little girl        but   can she help me get on a lifeboat      dicaprio is a revelation    i hadn t seen him before in anything   and didn t know what the heck to expect   really       honestly   i expected a bad irish accent   but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea   so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game      dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive   and being on the titanic   that it s hard not to like him    from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg   dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest   and he never falters    winslet s character grows up a lot during the movie   and so does her performance    at first   she s not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop dead gorgeous    we know from the narration that she s monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane   but there isn t any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio    winslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg    it s at that moment where winslet s character really comes alive    faced with real danger   she drops her spoiled rich girl mannerisms and does a splendid job    as rose and jack race around the doomed ship   looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal s fiery temper   winslet turns in a superb acting performance   mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror    of course   the most interesting character is the ship itself    cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic   and shows her in every mood    as a deserted wreck   down in the boiler room   up on the bridge   down in the hold   at the captain s table   down in steerage    and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead    cameron s greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well    
Pos, i have a soft spot in my heart for pure   amoral sleaze    i liked showgirls   there   i said it      i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz   sex filled cinematic tabloid ish trash    wild things is the best sleazy film i ve ever seen    it s filled with great performances   graphic sex   three way sex   rape charges   double crosses   plot twists   genitalia of all genders   graphic violence   death   witty humor   and   best of all   denise richards    criticizing this film for being disgusting   raucous   and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing   or titanic for being lofty and epic    wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors   but i don t just admire it for this  i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies    i must admit up front   however   that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal    i imagine that this shows    it s hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn t be known    i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer   but i was wrong   there are a lot of turns here    i ll just say that the film takes place in blue bay   a rich little town in florida    in blue bay lives sam lombardo   matt dillon     a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students   kelly van ryan   denise richards     and suzie toller   neve campbell      kelly s mother   sandra   theresa russell     immediately presses charges    all of this happens fairly early in the film    and right up until this point   i had the whole film predicted    i was wrong   though   and every time i was proven wrong   i was shocked    wild things isn t even remotely plausible   but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless   and often invited   just for kicks    i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers    i d give the preview four stars    it made me want to see the movie so much that i ve been waiting for it anxiously ever since    over the past few weeks though   i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview   see independence day     thankfully   i was proven wrong    the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company   not only does it make us want to see the film   but it doesn t give away any of the secrets    but i m not here to talk about the preview    i m here to talk about denise richards    now   i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers   but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she s in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can    of course   this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes       and  flawless body       but  i thought she did a great job acting   too   stop laughing      no   richards is truly a find  she is talented   and always convincing in this film    this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future    the other actors are good   too    dillon is as suave as ever   it s nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in & out      bacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer    neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them   though i won t pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex    for a plot like this to work   all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived    that s okay   because director john mcnaughton knows that he s making a self consciously wicked film    each scene  even the three way sex scene  is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton   and the result is a sleaze fest that s too smart to resist    there isn t an inconsistent moment in wild things   every bit of it is alluring garbage   so trashy it s funny   and so entertaining it s painful    i loved it    
Neg, if you ve seen the trailers or commercials   it s rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store    well   it s hard to tell after watching the movie as well    bruce willis is a resident of the future   and it is a rather bleak future    the world s population had disintigrated into a mere 200   000 and is no longer ruled by humans but animals    the reason    in 1995   an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with a pure virus   thus wiping out practically the world s population in a mere month    bruce willis  character is one of the surviving few   but is enslaved by scientists   as are most of last living humans    they barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task   go into the past   find the leader of the army of the 12 monkeys   and kill him    well   this explanation didn t come easy    although the movie is very thought provoking of us as a people   our future and the evilo in the world   as a story it is very confusing    and dragging    i know a movie isn  t keeping my interest when i fidget in my seat or feel the need to look at my watch only to find that it s only been an hour passed    terry gilliam has a certain style that i realize many appreciate   and i haven t watched his previous work brazil   but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out   you wish it were more complex   and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me    
Pos, in essence   good will hunting is an ordinary story told well    taken as a whole   there s little that s special about this tale    it follows a traditional narrative path   leaves the audience with a warm   fuzzy feeling   and never really challenges or surprises us    but it s intelligently written   with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant     strongly directed   and nicely acted    so   while good will hunting is far from a late year masterpiece   it s a worthwhile sample of entertainment    like scent of a woman   which was released around this time of the season five years ago   good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world weary veteran and a cocky young man    the formula for the two films is similar    both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it    but the characters are different    al pacino s slade was a larger than life individual   robin williams  sean mcguire is much more subtle    and matt damon s will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o donnell s charlie    will is a troubled individual    as a child   he was the frequent victim of abuse    an orphan   he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis    now   not yet 21 years old   he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet    he has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box    but he s a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems    while working as a janitor at mit   he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building s hall blackboards    then   one evening   his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau   stellan skarsgard   catches him at work    will flees   but lambeau tracks him down    unfortunately   by the time the professor finds him   will is in jail for assaulting a police offer    the judge agrees to release will under two conditions   that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist    eventually   once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man   sean mcguire   a teacher at bunker hill community college   agrees to take the case    after a rocky start   the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor    and   as will advances his self awareness in sessions with sean   he also learns about friendship from his buddy   chuckie   ben affleck     and love from a harvard co ed named skylar   minnie driver      the script   by co stars matt damon and ben affleck   is not a groundbreaking piece of literature   and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation    the characters are well developed   however   and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles    at one point   will comments that a session with sean is turning into a   taster s choice moment      later   will gives a brilliant   breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith       note   since smith co executive produced good will hunting   it s not out of the question that he had some input into this scene      director gus van sant   drugstore cowboy   to die for   culls genuine emotion from his actors   and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes    there s an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions   and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver   who became romantically linked while making this film   translates effectively to the movie    the will/skylar relationship is electric    likewise   the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie s friendship    many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation   even if the overall story is somewhat generic    matt damon   who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker   is solid   although not spectacular   as will    minnie driver   last seen in grosse pointe blank   adds another strong performance to a growing resume   and it s refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one      the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams   whose sean is sad and wise   funny and somber    arguably the best dramatic work in the actor s career   alongside what he did in the fisher king     williams  portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination    adequate support is provided by ben affleck   chasing amy   and stellan skarsgard   breaking the waves      like most of what comes before it   the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable    but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren t always bad things in a movie   provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail    good will hunting does both   and   as a result   earns a rating commensurate with the   good   in the title

Neg, in this re make of the 1954 japanese monster film   godzilla is transformed into a   jurassic park   copy who swims from the south pacific to new york for no real reason and trashes the town    although some of the destruction is entertaining for a while   it gets old fast    the film often makes no sense   a several hundred foot tall beast hides in subway tunnels     sports second rate effects   the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen     lame jokes   mayor ebert and his assistant gene are never funny     horrendous acting   even matthew broderick is dull   and an unbelievable love story   why would anyone want to get back together with maria pitillo s character        there are other elements of the film that fall flat   but going on would just be a waste of good words    only for die hard creature feature fans   this might be fun if you could check your brain at the door    i couldn t       michael redman has written this column for 23 years and has seldom had a more disorienting cinematic experience than seeing both   fear and loathing   and   godzilla   in the same evening      
Pos, it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system    no major surprise   when j   s   mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either    the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist   the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority    small wonder that hollywood s most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual underdog against some larger collective oppressive   witness braveheart   born on the fourth of july   rocky   first blood   clear and present danger   jfk   the list goes on    there s little of that in singapore   we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line   though the government s been long worried about the younger people getting   americanised   and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition    the people vs   larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america   sex    does pornography have a right to exist and circulate    larry flynt   the publisher of hustler magazine   thinks so   and obviously so too the u   s   congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net    but even with such actions   americans remain undecided    the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire    what they have ignored is actually a great picture    woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to hell with morality   to hell with the law   and to hell with the system anti christ that we last saw in natural born killers    and he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex stripper wife dearly    the latter is played with abandon   conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love   who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination   if not of the award itself    edward norton plays their jerky lawyer    the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox   superficially they are immoral outcasts who ve had it coming   woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down   and courtney dies of aids    god s damnation    but in the powerful love they have for each other   each standing by the other in turn   the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and   in the american context   a christian   if they can love and care   and feel just like anyone else on a personal level    friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral christian influences    to go beyond good and evil    this is a great picture   no doubt   and i love it personally    because it is moving   funny   ends with open american optimism blah blah    but i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions   and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases    there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities    this movie is not so much about larry flynt   but about americans and american society    
Pos, probably the most popular and praised film of all time   turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism    everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time    and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron   combining visual  and sound effects   he re creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere    i liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes    while their cabin is slowly filling up with water   a mother is telling her children a fairytail          and  they lived happily ever after          and then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air    however   the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie   while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues    in the present day   the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett   bill paxton     a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond   lost during the sinking    somewhere inside the ship   lovett s crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead    here   in the shape of a nude young lady   is a window into the distant age of 1912    lovett is extremely surprised when he get s a phone call from rose dawson   claiming that she is a model    she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel   and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years    as the memories come flooding back   she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer   kate winslet     the fianc   e of wealthy cal hockley   billy zane   and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater   frances fisher      on board there are rich and poor   everyone trust in the ship s designer   jonathan hyde   and her master   captain e   j    smith   bernard hill      on board the ship   rose   unhappy and restless meets jack   leonardo dicaprio     a young american artist   poor   brave and attractive    a love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes   but also face the greatest power on earth   death    cameron could as well have called his picture   the never ending love   or   love at first sight     as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple   and not on the disaster itself    the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap opera    the director doesn t even try to overcome his empty script    because of its primitive and predictable plot   titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking    russel carpenter s rich   majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award worthy    everything from art direction to visual and sound effects are a top notch    but it doesn t help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them    the actors are not to blame   because their characters are more like caricatures   in other words   fake    jack is a man with many talents   he is a talented artist   handsome   brave   honest   strong   funny       you  name it    he doesn t have any dark side   he doesn t make any mistakes   that for a second would make him human    jack is perfect   but he is   poor    on the other hand we have cal    he is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wife to be    he lacks everything jack possesses   but he is    rich    this childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture    cameron knows precisely what we want to see    his film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audience   attractive actors   a   tragic love story     beautiful visuals   including expensive special effects     a dose of social criticism   a fascinating historical event   we love true stories   and last   but not least   an incredible media support   which proclaimed an average picture the   greatest film of all time      on the outside titanic looks perfect   but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals   is emptiness   nothing to think about    the main weakness of this film   which ironically became its success   is simplicity    cameron enables our basic and if you wish   primitive emotions   love   hate   fear and helplessness    everyone understands the power of love and the threat to our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable   a sinking ship    titanic is a typical hollywood production   totally and completely dependent on visual perfection to hide its primitive plot    it s a good picture   but absolutely not a masterpiece    it s among hundreds and thousands good films released every year   not better or worse than the average american film    
Neg, rated   r for strong violence   language   drug use   nudity   and some sexuality    starring   wesley snipes   anne archer   michael chaykin   donald sutherland   marie matiko    running time   117 minutes  directed by   christian duguay  i ve never fully understood wesley snipes s career    he has his ups and downs   but mostly the downs    his best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled   blade      he has had his typical action movies     boiling point       passenger 57     but his new movie   the art of war   should just be called   rising sun 2   the art of war   cause basically it s a semi remake of the same plot   with a different cast   and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller   that is high on style and low on substance    wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u   n   after a chinese ambassador is killed   he is on the track of the killer   trying to find out who it is   how it happened   where the killer was   and what to do    anne archer plays his   boss   type person of the u   n   and she has hired snipes to track down the killer    well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer   and is now an outlaw   kidnapping a chinese woman with him   and having her help him along the way    all this leads to a finale that is so dumb   and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb   and the stunts   dialogue and acting all ruin this movie    wesley snipes isn t one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before    the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998 s   blade      i walked into   the art of war   expecting a good   high octane thriller   and all i got was a pile of mush    the only real  good  thing the movie has is action   and plenty of it   but i noticed it is badly filmed   the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on    the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful   that it even tries to mock   the matrix     laughably funny   it is undeniably stupid    christian duguay s direction is also not that great    his camera angles and sense of style are all in place   but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done    even the whole   matrix   ending wasn t even good    the stunts and action are badly filmed   and badly choreographed    his placing of the characters   and the assination of the chinese ambassador   and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable   that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie    anne archer who is usually good in her roles   turns in a horrible job here    she is sour   downbeat   and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue   and dumb moves    even donald sutherland as a co star can t save this movie from being a bust    so for an overall opinion     the art of war   is a total waste of time    it s not entertaining   nor exciting   or even action packed    it is a pointless movie   and makes absolutely no sense at all    if you really want to see a good version of   the art of war     rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind   rising sun     it isn t a great film either   but at least it s better than this    
Pos, scream 2 isn t quite as clever as its predecessor   but it fills the gap with a cutting wit    death    even gruesome   bloody death    can be funny if handled the right way   some will be offended by this statement   but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example      and   while there s plenty of horror to go around in scream 2   the latest  90s slasher flick incarnation   there are also a few laughs to be had    scream 2 is a slice and dice movie for those who don t take their horror too seriously    the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise    the unexpected blockbuster   whose gross soared over the $100 million mark during its six month release window   opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time    a sequel was inevitable   fortunately   nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2   including director wes craven   screenwriter kevin williamson   and actors neve campbell   courtney cox   david arquette   jamie kennedy   and liev schreiber    as stipulated by one of the   rules of sequels   uttered by a movie  obsessed character in the film   the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original    paradoxically   there s a lot less gore    there is blood   of course   but nothing excessive by slasher movie standards   and there are no depictions of spilled entrails    craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids    a second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut out stereotypes lined up for slaughter    after all   we ve known some of these people for two movies    it s almost impossible not to care about them at least a little    scream 2 opens approximately two years after the original    as in the first picture   there s a slick   self mocking prologue    this time   the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps   whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab   which is based on the   true life   events of scream      some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films   it s surely no coincidence that   in addition to pinkett and epps   scream 2 features two black characters      shortly thereafter   she and her boyfriend have been gutted   signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders    craven lets loose a burst of tongue in cheek creativity for the   movie within a movie   sequences    they give him an opportunity to openly parody scream    an act that he accomplishes with great panache    stab features heather graham in the   casey becker   role   played in the original by drew barrymore   and tori spelling as   sidney prescott     neve campbell      sadly   we only see a couple of scenes from stab    it would have been a little more fun   i think   had craven used joe dante s approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production    following the prologue   we are re introduced to sidney prescott   who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college    her friend randy   jamie kennedy   is a student there as well   and he s just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever    once the double murder at stab becomes big news   the media converges on windsor   looking to interview the original victim    at the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers   courtney cox     who has a little surprise for sidney    she has brought cotton weary   liev schreiber     the man sidney falsely accused of murder   with her    also arriving at the college is deputy dewey   david arquette     who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations    in addition to the survivors from the original scream   the field of potential victims is well populated    there s a blond co ed named cece   sarah michelle gellar   who has now appeared in two of williamson s movies    this one and i know what you did last summer     sidney s requisite boyfriend   derek   jerry o connell     a local newswoman   laurie metcalf     gale s new cameraman   duane martin     a british drama teacher   david warner     and several sorority sisters and would be sorority sisters   portia de rossi   rebecca gayheart   elise neal   marisol nichols      ultimately   there are lots of attractive corpses    from the stab scenes to lines like   brothers don t last long in situations like this     craven and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream 2   and the movie is enjoyable   if a little overlong   the livelier first hour is better than the second      their resolution to the obligatory   whodunit      is less of a letdown than it could be   and knowingly offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes         nice twist     quips the killer       didn t see it coming   didya        one senses   however   that   by the end of this picture   the overall concept of a hip   self referential slasher film has been played out    supposedly   there s going to be a scream 3   but   if the film makers don t come up with something radical   we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill    
Pos, steven spielberg s second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film    spielberg   ever the student on film   has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest   and most powerful entries    he also managed to cast this era s greatest answer to jimmy stewart   tom hanks   who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle    for about 160 out of its 170 minutes     saving private ryan   is flawless    literally    the plot is simple enough    after the epic d day invasion   whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular     capt   john miller   hanks   and his team are forced to search for a pvt    james ryan   damon     whose brothers have all died in battle    once they find him   they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home    accompanying miller are his crew   played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational    barry pepper   adam goldberg   vin diesel   giovanni ribisi   davies   and burns are the team sent to find one man   and bring him home    the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary    literally    there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film s first 20 minutes    spielberg films almost the entire movie without music   leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion   and they do to perfection    the sequences in france   all of them   beginning with the battle and ending with the battle   are fabulous   especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides   trying to save private ryan    there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences    this is what coppola was looking for in   apocalypse now     but couldn t create    the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war    the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary    he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world   with his comic timing   dramatic flair   his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears    hanks is this country s finest actor   and he proves it here    however   spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece    with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time   spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film    the sequence involving army chief of stafff george marshall and mrs   ryan is decent   but doesn t hold up to the rest of the film   relying on wartime cliches to power it    but that is forgivable    what isn t is the bookends of the film   the cemetary sequences    the first one is quite good   a decent introduction into the lives of these men    the last sequence is atrocious    the forced emotion   accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music   is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film    these flaws are what downgrade   ryan   from the greatest film of our era   to the greatest war film of our era    spielberg should have trusted his own material   and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie   to end his masterpiece right there    the use of the flag   though patriotic   is in contrast to the movie s theme    the power of the bulk of the film   however   is astonishing    spielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art   that persists even after first viewing of the film   is extraordinary    this is the film of the year    
Neg, synopsis   a man whose lover   paris   was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system    the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend   laura   and becomes addicted to virtual reality   which   due to a design flaw in his unit   recreates the dead paris    comments   virtual seduction   executive produced by roger corman and lance h   robbins   serves as a cheaply made precursor to strange days   a far superior film    both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are   ab   using technology to be with former lovers   in strange days   the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality      interestingly   both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium   though strange days uses the setting far more effectively    this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction    it s not bad for what it is   low budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality    unfortunately   it s been done before and since in much better films   a fact which ultimately leaves the sci fi fan bored by this movie    virtual seduction has many faults   one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins      the film s script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first   but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy handed and wooden as the movie progresses    many important scenes seem too dark   the lighting could have been improved significantly    the cast   a collection of veteran b movie actors and sitcom regulars   do only a mediocre job in their roles    jeff fahey   of the original lawnmower man   convincingly   though unenergetically   plays the lead character    carrie genzel plays paris   the vr lover   but ami dolenz   as the current love interest   seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality   which doesn t lend credence to the film s premise    meschach taylor   of the once popular designing women sitcom   adequately plays a scientist working on the project   but his performance isn t something to write home about either    virtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background    in other words   one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then   but it s rather boring to just sit and watch    the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from b movies in this genre   but it is still an adult r rated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt    this turkey   ultimately   isn t awful   but it s not particularly interesting or unique either    don t be seduced into watching this movie unless you ve got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch    
Neg, there isn t much good about this movie    not much i can say about the acting   directing   or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie    so i ll get my one good comment out of the way   at least joel schuemacher   batman & robin   didn t direct it or it would be titled   technicolor city      in fact there is nothing colorful about this movie   its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end    the plot has a tendency to be interesting   but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie    the plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets   so i will just touch on the bare minimum    john murdoch   rufus sewell   awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel   only to find out he has forgotten everything    john must find out who he is before the   strangers     a   k   a    mind erasing aliens   find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy    during the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality   and the existence of inherently evil people    any of these points however are completely   erased   from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script    as i mentioned earlier   nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film    the acting is bland   and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care    the special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake   a sign of a true   b movie      the direction is poor and there is little continuity   not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly    lastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality   and doesn t deserve to have the word   science   in science fiction    if i haven t got my point across   i ll say it more plainly   this is a bad movie    lets hope the next movie by alex   i wish i was tim burton   proyas is at least tolerable

Pos, when you go to the movies as much as i do   you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times    such was the case with frequency    every time i went to a screening   there was the frequency preview    it looked awful    it looked cheesy   sappy and ridiculous    it looked like a flop    well   whoever put that trailer together should be fired   because in terms of pure entertainment   frequency is one of the best of the year thus far    frequency boasts a compelling story line    an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan   james caviezel   to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan   dennis quaid   through a ham radio   despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years    john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire   but by doing so causes other changes    somehow   a serial killer s reign of terror   which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders   extends to ten victims        including john s mother    this is director gregory hoblit s third film   the other two being primal fear and fallen      with all three   he s managed to attach himself to great scripts   this one by toby emmerich   whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films   and add equally great direction    also   he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick ass ending    frequency is no exception   the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying    hoblit is three for three   and i hope he can keep it up    now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci fi elements of frequency    but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved    who s to say how something works and how it doesn t when it s never happened    is it because we ve become accustomed to time travel   laws   from other places like   star trek   and the back to the future trilogy and   quantum leap      yes   if you sit down and think about it   certain plot elements in this film probably won t make any sense    most films are like that    don t let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however    when frequency was over   it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug   okay okay   shut up      when you break it down past all its sci fi elements and serial killer antics   frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share    it s touching   it s sincere   and it s what ultimately makes this movie work    [pg 13]

Pos,    a man is not a man without eight taels of gold      starring sammo hung   sylvia chang   directed by mabel cheung   written by cheung and alex law   cinematography by bill wong  eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love    neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful   but both are good enough    and along the way there is one perfect scene   which is one more than you find in most films    slim   played by portly sammo hung   better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies   is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york    when the movie opens   we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver    he does not seem particularly out of place    in fact   he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years   spending most of his life savings in the process   and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water   as he realizes that you can never go home    he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters   cheap sunglasses   and lobsters   which have to be large   to prove they re american     the tokens of his success    he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch   because without eight taels of gold   a man is not a man   my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east   and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb      he loses most of this stuff  except the gold  when his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride   so to speak   on a raft along the river which runs past his parents  village    when he arrives unannounced   he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father    all of this has the makings of a routine comedy   and the movie has its amusing moments   as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming   and they all give him birds   so by evening s end he is surrounded by turkeys   ducks   geese and other sundry fowl    but eight taels is not a comedy  it is a sad   sweet story about the choices people make   and how they are sometimes irreparable    director mabel cheung   an autumn s tale   the soong sisters   sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the world  what it is like to no longer have a place to call home    slim does not belong in china   nor does he belong in america   where he can barely speak the language    seeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village   we come to know the world slim left behind   and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time   and wishes it felt more like home    the condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed   i   being one   was sympathetic    on his way to his parent s village   slim hooks up with jenny   sylvia chang     whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds and ends   which is what he continues to call her   although she is now a mature   professional   attractive woman   to be married in the spring to an american chinese man    slim and odds and ends fall for each other    that s predictable    the manner in which their   non    romance is played out is not    the emotions involved are adult and complex   and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma    it s typical   for instance   that the fianc   in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk   because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover    but here the fianc   is a decent   ordinary guy   and although slim would like to feel anger   he cannot    the fianc   has done nothing wrong   the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions   take your pick    eight taels has its share of flaws   the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak     but it compensates with insight    when odds and ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco   she notes resignedly     it s all the same    wherever we go   we ll be in chinatown     and her straightforward statement expresses much    there is insight   too   in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds and ends  decisions   he to move to america   she to marry a chinese american    both their choices were perhaps born of impatience   perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener  and it turns out that both choices were wrong    but they cannot undo them   they must live with what they have done    such is life    the movie is tender toward these people   but it offers no false comforts    everything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene   which is the culmination of the love story    slim and odds and ends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly   with the muted pop pop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them   and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss    the exchange that follows   and what slim then does   is poignant and perfect   with clarity and understatement   we see two people s lives   their heartbreaks and virtues   summed up in a single moment    yes   the film is flawed   but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies    
Neg,    i would appreciate it if you didn t do that again      starring jet li   bridget fonda   tch   ky karyo   burt kwouk    directed by chris nahon    rated r    it s no secret that martial arts film often use their plot simply to get from one action sequence to another    when the fight scenes are enough to justify paying admission   there is no problem with this   as in most jackie chan projects and a lot of the hong kong actioners    when they aren t   well   we re in bad shape    kiss of the dragon   jet li s second consecutive american misfire   plays like one big miscalculation   and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment    now before i start getting e mails angrily touting the genius of jet li   let me explain myself    li is as spectacular as ever here   and i don t think anyone would ever dare call his martial arts star skills into question    the problem isn t with him   it s with the movie s tone    the much touted fight scenes here are filmed with such unflinching   unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch    they re joyless   perfuctory   li s rogue chinese detective is more of a killing machine than a hero   a terminator with a black belt instead of a metal skeleton    but even the terminator in judgement day had a sympathetic side    the plot isn t relevant   but if you re curious   it s some nonsense about a chinese law enforcement officer   li   sent to paris to investigate a possible drug ring and encounter a corrupt chief of police   tcheky karyo     who kills people and does sinister things with no motivation whatsoever    oh yeah   and li s character is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain and/or kill at the touch of a needle       kiss of the dragon   is the name of an acupuncture maneuver   in which you stick a needle in a precise location on the back of the victim s neck   somehow redirecting all of the body s bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately    there s a vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute   whose daughter is being held hostage   for some reason   by the villain    this is one of the worst love stories i have ever seen on screen   even worse than the one in pearl harbor    there s no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it   it s only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boy meets girl subplot    kiss of the dragon was written by luc besson   whose screenplay the messenger   the story of joan of arc   for all of that film s flaws   was at least thoughtful    i don t know why the guy got himself involved in this train wreck   but perhaps he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fifth element and the aforementioned stylized biopic    i suppose you could call this mainstream   but i ll choose the bizarre any time of the day    if action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling   you need a story to justify watching them    the filmmakers behind kiss of the dragon should have rethought their strategy    no one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling   but i hear rush hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks    
Pos,    jaws   is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen    the movie opens with blackness   and only distant   alien like underwater sounds    then it comes   the first ominous bars of composer john williams  now infamous score    dah dum    from there   director steven spielberg wastes no time   taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly    right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean   and once   jaws   has attacked   it never relinquishes its grip    perhaps what is most outstanding about   jaws   is how spielberg builds the movie    he works it like a theatrical production   with a first act and a second act    unlike so many modern filmmakers   he has a great deal of restraint   and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act    until then   he merely suggests its presence with creepy   subjective underwater shots and williams  music    he s building the tension bit by bit   so when it comes time for the climax   the shark s arrival is truly terrifying    he doesn t let us get bored with the imagery    the first act opens with police chief martin brody   roy scheider     a new york cop who has taken an easy   peaceful job running the police station on amity island   a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years    the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july   and the mayor   larry vaughn   murray hamilton     doesn t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money    brody is joined by matt hooper   richard dreyfuss     a young   ambitious shark expert from the marine institute    hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it    his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark     it s a perfect engine   an eating machine     make it that much more terrifying    when vaughn finally relents   hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint   robert shaw   on his decrepit boat   the orca   to search for the shark    the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark   and inevitably   are hunted by it       jaws   is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing   tension   and horror    it is like ten movies all rolled into one   and it s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975   taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time   until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by   star wars        even today   fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock s   psycho     and it never seems to age    although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences   including several mechanical sharks   obsolete   none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill    the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing   characterization   sharp editing   and creative photography   instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects    scheider   dreyfuss   and shaw were known actors at the time   jaws   was made   but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman    nevertheless   this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark    scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what s right and going against the entire town       it s your first summer here   you know     mayor vaughn warns him    dreyfuss   who had previously been seen in   american graffiti     1973   and   the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz     1974   gives a surprisingly mature   complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers    however   most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie s captain ahab   a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards    bordering of parody   shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism    he s slightly deranged   and shaw s performance is almost a caricature    however   there is one scene late in the film   when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars    quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u   s   s    indianapolis   a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese    his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1   000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair raising than anything spielberg put on screen    shaw delivers the story in one long take   and it is the best acting in the film    of course   we can t leave out the shark itself   with its black eyes   endless rows of teeth   and insatiable urge to eat   it is basically the epitome of all mankind s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature    a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real    having survived sinch the dinosaurs   great whites do exist   they can be as large as the shark in   jaws     and they are a threat    every one of spielberg s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark   a bunch of writihing   dangling   completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into    the shark in   jaws   was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks   all nicknamed   bruce   by the crew   built to be shot from different angles    many have forgotten   but   jaws   was a sort of precursor to   waterworld     1995     a movie s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb    but   as we can see now   spielberg overcame all the obstacles   and delivered one of the finest primal scare thrillers ever to come out of hollywood    
Pos,    the celebration   is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant    you know   where you sit down to watch it   and no matter what you ve heard about it before   you just can t help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs    i prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like    i don t really feel there are to be any real   rules   for cinema   a film can do anything   as long as it makes it work    but i do ask that all films have one thing in common   they create experiences    when i watch a film   no matter what kind of film it is   i want to be able to take certain memories along with me       the celebration   is great because it s chock full of those    it creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life    and then it makes things just a tad bit farscial   just to make sure you re paying attention   which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored   then you re of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning up    the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch   henning mortizen     who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him    all his friends and family turn up   and for the first half hour   we get introduced to everyone   simplistically and realistically   no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here      the eldest son   christian   ulrich thomsen   looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell     is the first to be seen in the film   walking to his father s home    his brother   michael   thomas bo larsen     drives by   pulls over   greets him   then kicks his family out of the car   forcing them to walk to the estate   just so christian can be comfortable    we then meet helene   paprika steen     their sister   a woman who always seems to be stressed out   who invites the driver of her car   gbatokai dakinah     an american   to to come join her at the party she s going to    once they re all there and settled in   the party begins   and as custom   the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad   so christian stands up   at the head of the table   and reveals the film s punchline   his father raped all his children at a young age    but since this is a family/friends affair   his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth   and is simply brushed off despite his efforts   and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir   and it s all terribly interesting to watch    twists occur   and soon the film has taken on a nearly farsical nature   but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends    the most notorious thing about this film   which has been getting the most notice   though   is that the director   thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion    as a member of the danish filmmakers clan   dogme 95   a group that has vowed to oppose   the auteur concept   make up   illusions   and dramaturgical predictability   so that they may   purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot      i have not seen   breaking the waves     the other notable film by a member of this group   lars von trier   to be exact     but   the celebration   works exquisitely in this department    it feels like reality   like you re actually watching real people and not actors   and as a major pointer   has been shot on video    as a result   it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film   but always wanted to    we see key moments in people s lives that they wouldn t dare show to the world   and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style   as ironically showmanship as it really is   works perfectly for the nature of the film    the key   though   to this film   and the reason it s not just a cool danish import   is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth    throughout the film   we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies   a debate so three dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the truth at all costs reasoning out of the water    of course it was not right for the father to rape his children   and of course   they couldn t have fought back then   and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them    and yes   it s thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later   when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier    but then again   the father   after all   is not a totally bad guy   and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier   we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he s done   and deep down   feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface    the final scene   involving mortizen and everyone else   is utterly devastating   thanks to him and thomsen   whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex    everyone else is flawless as well   the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them    the actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest   there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays   exactly like life    as such     the celebration   may be the one truly bizarro film of the year   a work of art so eerily close to reality that it s utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating    
Neg,  soldier  is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn t have jean claude van damme in it    i could liken it to the sci fi cheese that was the hollywood product of choice back in the early 80s   but that would be too much of a compliment    if there is a movie theater in hell   this film is playing there 24 hours a day    the story   such that there is   revolves around todd   kurt russell     an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not too distant ultra conservative future   is there any other kind      after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him   todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy    who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed   but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesn t matter   because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys    after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash    yes folks   there s more    we see todd as a buff   scarred adult   now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat    there s a new wrinkle   though    todd and his brethren are declared obsolete   and a new batch of soldiers takes their place    after losing a sanctioned battle with  dragon  s jason scott lee   the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice cube tray   well   that s what is looked like   on a remote garbage planet    if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet   and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them   you re way ahead of the game    the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute    it s surprising that  soldier  is the brain child of  blade runner  co writer david webb peoples    unlike that mind twisting classic   this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double spaced pages    add into the mix the  mortal kombat  s paul anderson inept direction   and it s easy to see how  soldier  turned out so bad    and the special effects !  remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars    gary busey is in this movie     nuff said     soldier  is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults    that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all    now if you ll excuse me   i have to go weep for the future    
Neg, `bats  is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan    to pull something like this off   you need to have a sense of wit and style   with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines    something like the underground worm thriller `tremors  had just the perfect mixture of these elements   and in return   the film was tremendous fun    with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player   `bats  mainly plays it s premise for straight arrow horror    judging by the ridiculous premise   this was not exactly a wise move    the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock s `the birds    but fails miserably    done right   it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema    unfortunately   `bats  is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly   terribly wrong    the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be    i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats  is aimed toward    those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats    these bats are not very nice   because they eat a lot of people    boy   are these bats ugly    they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super duper smart    they ve got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all    a whole bunch of people in texas get killed   so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats    they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with   but the bats are pretty smart   so it s sorta hard to do    the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good    but no   `bats  is probably too violent for pre schoolers    the film   directed by louis morneau   should have ventured straight into video stores    on the small screen   perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations    but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward   although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure   the film is poorly written   poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude    even the bats themselves are cheesy   and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed    the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey   lou diamond phillips     who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small town authority figure usually portrays   he chomps on a cigar   struts contentedly in his boots   etc            the scientist is dr   sheila casper   dina meyer     who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field     meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable   but everything about dr   casper is recycled beyond recognition    her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper s tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws     everything revolving around `bats  is tired drivel   which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up    the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw   with voices dubbed in later    in fact   that may have worked out better in the end    take one glance at casper s bat loathing sidekick jimmy   leon     and you ll have immediate deja vu   he s the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie   constructed specifically for timed comic relief    unfortunately   none of his comic interludes are funny    in the role of deranged mad scientist dr   mccabe   the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch    mccabe `accidentally  released two experimental test subjects   and the virus spread to other bats    the entire town of gallup   texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures   but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else    something like   `when is the damn movie going to be over      i just want my money      the bats are ugly   i must say    there s the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing   but mainly   the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery    only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been   but by the absurdly stupid climax   it s way too late in the game for a decent recovery    characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire    let s explore the logic there   is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population      you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one   and after that there are only 18   000 more of them    this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind `bats     
Pos, as a devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens   i have some idea of how ellie aroway   jodie foster   feels    but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers   i can t say that i do exactly    her reason is that she needs solid proof   there is no proof that god existed   so therefor she does not believe    ellie also believes in aliens   and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist    how can she say she doesn t believe in god because of the lack of proof   and then say she believes in aliens   which are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like a hypocrite    that s the catch 22    when aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for a device to transport someone to them   okay   well   they didn t really * fax * them          ellie wants to be the one to go   but because of her atheism she is denied the position    how dumb is that    she discovers the transmitions   then she isn t allowed to go    well   because of a bomb and a psychopath   jake busey     she * does * end up going   but not in the way that we would ve thought    contact is based on a novel by carl sagan   who died during the filmmaking    it is the best alien movie since close encounters of the 3rd kind   and will end up being the best film of the year    its views of science and religion will no doubt aggrivate some   but will stimulate more    i m glad at least one movie of the  90s can portray aliens in a psitive light   rather than a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides and then put on your body    
Pos, as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it   the more pleased i was when i left    first   getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz     if you liked scream   you ll love wild things !       campbell gives a stunning performance !       this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days !       oh yeah   the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me    now   onto more serious stuff   and with this film   i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way      wild things has single handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa    i m not saying that in a bad way   but when you see this film   you may be shocked by what you see    however   perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film s charming cast and tricky plot   that they let the film slide with an r rating    being mormon   i m bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film    trouble is   i have already seen it    and i like it !  wild things is a film noir of the 90s   filled with 40s sensibilities   and yet breaking the rules and modern day taboos of 90s culture    the style in which it is filmed is rich in color    the actors are all gorgeous people   seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film    sure   it s all too good to be true   but ain t it fun to watch    when movies like this come along   sort of a better version of basic instinct   there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it    there will be people who don t want to admit liking what they see   but i tell you   most anyone who sees this will like it    wild things begins at blue bay high school   the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into    it s almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance   totally based on looks alone      of course   there are those select few who may look slightly ugly   but compared to the average person   they are gorgeous    immediately   the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time    we can turn off our brains   right    wrong    while you may be expecting one thing to happen   it certainly doesn t turn out that way    the film begins in a classroom   with nearly all the main characters present    there s sam lombardo   matt dillon     a counselor for the students    he s heading the class discussion    there s also kelly van ryan   denise richards     a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam    teaching the class   however   are two policemen   ray duquette   kevin bacon   and gloria perez   daphne rubin vega     who want to talk about  sex           cheers   crimes   boos           what is a sex crime      ray asks       not gettin  any !    one student responds    this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch    however   upon hearing this   one student   suzie toller   neve campbell     stands up and leaves the room   commenting that they can both kiss part of her body    and so   wild things sets into motion    quickly   kelly begins hitting on sam   but sam doesn t want anything to do with her advances    kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him    she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep    surprisingly   that s really all i can tell you about the plot    any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists    and what s more   these plot twists are actually unpredictable    going along the way of scream   wild things maintains that film s surprises   and then adds even more to them    there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen    and even though you think you may get tired of them   the surprises are so genuine that it s rather pleasing    going back over them in my mind   nearly all of them work   though some stretch the boundaries of belief    thankfully   the convoluted plot doesn t give us much time to think about each one   pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off    as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy  well   it is    this is pretty much just one trashy film    however   it is the kind of trashy that isn t hard to watch    it s good trash   in a sense    one   the screenplay knows that it s not to be taken seriously   and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story    this varies everywhere from kelly s mother   theresa russell     who is more of a caricature of rich people   all the way to an ambulance chasing lawyer   bill murray     who wears a neck brace to cover an insurance scam he is running    bill murray also provides the best character in the film   and most of the genuine laughs    and two   the sex is more than gratuitous   although not unwelcomed    wild things is supposed to have sex in it   what film with that title wouldn t       and this movie breaks the boundaries    instead of having heterosexual sex scenes   it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell   don t worry        it s not as graphic as you might think      the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic   but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon s full frontal nude scene    it s very brief   so if you blink   you may miss   ahem   it    and   for as long as i can remember   i don t think i have seen an r rated film show an erect one before   it s not completely   but judging from the audiences  reaction   it was more than they expected too      also   during one scene late in the film   there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon s characters   but nothing came of it   makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating   or if the actors refused to do it      what first made me want to see wild things was its cast    neve campbell   of course   has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released    here   however   she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead    the closest role to this was her performance in the craft   though even in that she was a nice girl      campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent    you can tell she will be around for a long time    denise richards will also be around for a long time   although she may be limited to the roles without much range    here   she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff   yet effective   performance in starship troopers    hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability    and then there is daphne rubin vega   a newcomer to the movies    she gives a very good performance   although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half    towards the end she does get a bigger part    on the male side   matt dillon is probably the best   giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist    kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character   but he makes the most of it    you must have admiration   though   for what he did on screen    and judging from many of the women s reactions in the theater to that shot   they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon   yeah   right      and then there is bill murray    his performance is the comic relief   and he nearly steals the film    as a whole   the entire cast works wondrously together   and they seem at home   even when doing the menage a troi    director john mcnaughton   who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry   portrait of a serial killer   has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works    his direction is smooth and stylish    the visuals are striking   filled with rich colors   and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air    however   he seems more at home when the actors aren t talking    his fly by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant   and his photography of denise richards  climbing out of the pool is a highlight    the cinematography is gorgeous in its details   its not often that you see a film like this   and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures    then   there is the music    this was probably the most obvious thing to me   as it set the perfect mood for the film    it s hard to describe in words   so just see the film and listen to it    it s wonderfully composed and presented    and be sure to stick around during the closing credits !  mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use   while most comedies use it for outtakes      he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events    some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot   but it s an entertaining way to finish the film    plus   there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun    wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality   nudity   language and violence    again   the nudity is rather unnecessary   but let s face it  people want to see it    so why not give it to them    neve campbell   admirably   has a no nudity clause in her contract   and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off   way to go   neve !      the sex scenes are graphic   especially the first one we see   between the mother and one of her deck hands    one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating    the language is quite harsh too   ranging from sexual innuendo to your average   everyday profanity    and i can t stress it enough   don t allow kids under 18 to see this film    the target age for the movie is the 18 24 range   and that s who should see it    it s definitely not for those under 18 !  did i mention that this film is rated r   however   for those that do get a chance to watch it   you will probably more likely be pleased   and may even take friends to see it the next time    
Pos, capsule   the world will come to an end at midnight    everyone knows it and must make a final peace with the last hours of their lives    this is an intelligent science fiction film with no special effects   just personalities and ideas       high +2    4 to +4      it is the last night of the planet and several different people are reacting each in their own way to the end    the film covers 6 pm to midnight    the main character is patrick played by david mckellan who also wrote and directed      reminiscent of on the beach    but much more so of a story richard matheson wrote     the last day         p   s    on rereading the 1953 matheson   this film is almost a loose adaptation of that story    the similarities may be mere coincidence   but they are numerous and they are very striking        us release may be problematical    the title is lackluster and non memorable   though very appropriate when you know about the film    also provincial americans may not care about the end of the world coming to toronto    they probably would feel it would not affect them    perhaps a pbs release would be possible      patrick s family has declared it christmas and are hurt that the   adult   children will not spend the whole evening with them      grocery stores mostly looted    it seems though that one of everything is left      some people continue business as usual   some want sex   some react with religion   some riot    some people are in total denial      much comedy   much drama      very canadian cast      it does not get dark    it is just always daytime      radio playing   last night i didn t get to sleep at all      how appropriate      david cronenberg as a kind of bland functionary manager at the gas company    genvieve bujold as french teacher visiting former student      science fiction film with no special effects   cost about two million dollars      the person you have been thrown together with by chance becomes the most important person to you for the rest of your life      why would it be so precisely at midnight    what about other time zones    what is the nature of what is destroying the world

Neg, dr dolittle   20th century fox   running time   1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor   1996     murphy returns in this abysmal comedy    he plays doctor john dolittle   who as a child had the ability to understand animals    however   after being  exorcised  he loses this ability   and we fast forward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people   most notably dr mark weller   played by oliver platt      however   with a bonk on the head his ability to understand animals returns   and  comedy  is ready and waiting to happen    except comedy never does happen    doctor dolittle   even with the excellent premise   rarely manages to raise a laugh    poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie   and his performance suffers    the manic murphy we saw in the 80 s is gone   his more mature   and more boring   twin appears to be getting all the work in the 90 s    the voices of the animals   which include albert brooks   chris rock   the  new  eddie murphy   and norm mcdonald as  lucky  the dog are marginally better   and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie    sadly   most of their lines are pretty dumb    and they re not  funny  dumb   like dumb & dumber   1994     but just boring dumb    the film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through   in a desperate attempt to raise some laughs    there are a few good jokes in the script   but they are few and far between    if i had to choose a favourite performance   it would probably be albert brooks tiger   who has a certain charm about him    sadly   he s barely in the movie   and rock s really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time    joke wise   we are thankfully   spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor    the director   betty thomas   has   well   done better films    she bought us private parts   1997   and the brady bunch movie   1995   which were   sadly   much better than this    the scenes lack any charm   she just gets the job done    the animals themselves   are reasonable realistic   although most of them are obviously puppets    there s an impressive looking tiger   however   and the lip sync is pretty good    you d have no problem guessing that most of the close up s are puppets   however   with their jilted movement    i was hoping jim hensons workshop   who created the furry friends   would have done a better job    doctor dolittle   in the end   is a disappointment for everyone involved    murphy has done much better movies   i   e  trading places   the director has seen better days   and even the creatures aren t that good    the target audience   aged between 7 13   who are undemanding   will probably like it however   thanks to it s dumbed down humour    everyone else   however   should give doctor dolittle a miss    
Pos, how many of us would become strippers    for those of us who wouldn t   is it a moral reason   or purely a lack of confidence    that s probably not a fair question   and for a lot of us   it could very well be for neither of those reasons    as you watch the full monty   however   you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions    would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough    in case you haven t guessed   the full monty is about stripping   but striptease it ain t    it s actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication    it is the story of six out of work   out of shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless   but not without need    what to do    it hits our main character gaz   robert carlyle   as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis    it seems that simple   take it off and bring in the cash    eventually   gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance    these include the overweight   confidence lacking dave   mark addy     the uptight   overly officious gerald   tom wilkinson     the once suicidal lomper   steve huison     and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition   horse   paul barber     an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy   and guy   hugo speer     a young well endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant    when the sextet is complete   we re given a hefty dose of physical comedy    we watch the bumbling middle aged men choreograph pseudo sexy dance numbers   all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place    as if there anti appeal wasn t enough   they decide to boost interest in the group by promising   the full monty   on opening night   which for us americans   means baring it all            and i mean * all *    the movie actually ends on opening night   a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add    it s sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater    with the subject matter   you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel good   almost inspiring film   but it surprisingly turns out that way    the amount of light   touching drama also comes as a nice surprise   never feeling off balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film    there s a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words   and the ensemble cast couldn t be better    each character is completely individual   interesting   funny   and most importantly   real    the full monty is never offensive   a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone could ve easily fallen prey to tastelessness    it s one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment   perfect for a great night on the town   or as a saturday night movie rental    either way you see it   it shouldn t let you down in the slightest    and   pun heavily intended   when it s all said and done   you ll be smiling from cheek to cheek    
Neg, i had an epiphany today    it occurred to me while i was watching   house on haunted hill      it is as follows   if a trailer makes the film it s advertising look like a trashy   stupid movie   well guess what    chances are   there * is * truth in advertising    too bad i didn t trust my own instincts when something or the other possessed me to see this movie    i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of   sleepy hollow      that and   dogma   started too late in the afternoon for my schedule    an hour of   angel   or   buffy   is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face    i wish i d seen it when it was halloween    at least i would have been forgiving    hey   tis the season    the movie was scary   albeit very confusing   dizzying   and nauseating   at first   but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn t going anywhere    now i truly appreciate films like   scream       halloween     or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic    that s what spooks people out   the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know    there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with    sure   utterly unpredictable is good   too   but that s different from utterly nonsensical    hohh   house on haunted hill     on the other hand            well let s just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh so cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago    riiiiight    y know   that just sends chills down my spine    yeah    just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil    ooooooo    hint   blood and guts only work a few times    sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it s just ketchup and props and you ve got to come up with something better than that    there were just too many things in this movie that we ve all seen before   from the inevitable   plot developments   of strangers unwittingly trapped together   strangers turning against each other   the evil manifesting itself   the dead coming back for a last scare    each was more predictable than the last    why didn t these fools just stay together in one place anyways    sheesh    was i grossed out    yes    did i get spooked a few times    yes    but why    i get really disturbed when there is no why    when there weren t random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect   which wasn t that good either   trust me   and the scare   the film was filled with drab   laughable dialogue    the characters were incredibly flat and cliched    not to mention downright annoying    you ve got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives   of course they re dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night    jeez   i thought no one fell for those   you may already be a winner   things anymore    and of course   all three gals are babes    i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of   shine   ended up in this movie    keep that up   geoff   and you ll qualify for the next batman venture    the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because   well   he just cracks me up    and famke jansen   sp      because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan    pierce brosnan   hey   i willingly endured   dante s peak   three times for him        all right   i concede    there were a couple of things i enjoyed    that perverted little amusement park at the beginning    i probably won t ride a rollercoaster for a while    and the machine they used to drive geoffrey s character mad   see   i don t even remember their names      the machine   not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it    i kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie    it wouldn t have redeemed the film   but at least it would have made me feel better    but no   they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending    thank god they didn t add a kiss at the end or i would have puked    god   there is no hope    
Neg, it s a rare treat when a quality horror film is released in the theater    and unfortunately with man s best friend   we ll be waiting a while longer    the film stars ally sheedy and lance henrikson in a tale of bio genetics gone wrong    sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose need for a   good   story provokes her to snoop inside of emax   a poorly guarded million dollar bio lab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding    the result   she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max   a german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like a snake   camouflage like a chameleon   climb trees like a leopard   and attack with the strength of tiger    max takes a liking to sheedy   and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological realm of emax   owned by henrikson    well   it doesn t take long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon the unsuspecting suburban landscape which offers max juicy leg of mailman   etc        sheedy is a boring non presence on the screen   tripping through the enormous plot chasms neglected by the writer/director   i apologize for a lack of credits    i suppose i was eager to leave the theater   and in my rush   forgot to take note of the director   writer   producer   etc            henrikson offered the only relief from the contrived narration of the script   giving his character as much development as he could considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film    the movie depends upon it s ability to impress the audience with animal special effects   but all it presents is a dog that can growl   open door handles with his paw   sit   roll over   play dead   and sick    the rest of the special effects were so poor   i found them offensive    the film attains sub mediocrity   an unambitious film at best    horror fans might find that cujo offers a better bite    
Pos, much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of   lolita     made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made   over its use of pedophilia   and as such   it s important to address it straight forwardly   before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed   as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years   lying around in vaults san a distributor   and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit    when seeing this film   after all the hoopla   keeping in mind that there are people   namely me   who are fans of the novel   who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation       well    you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution    what s even worse is that seeing this   lolita     especially the first time and if you re familiar with anything   lolita     is admittingly very anticlimactic    this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film   ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it   it s really quite a film   perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne   although   really   look at its competition     flashdance       fatal attraction     and   indecent proposal       at least besides   jacob s ladder      i ve seen this   lolita   twice   the first time   i wasn t so blown away    it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting    the second time   not really thinking about how i ve waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i m seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre   it really affected me emotionally    the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one   which is why it s such a good novel   and why this is such a good film    the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14 year old girl named dolores a   k   a   lolita is great because it s not trash for the perverted but because it s about human obsession with things that are out of one s reach    its protagonist   the comically named humbert humbert   is not your average pedophile   but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies    the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology   something that will destroy us but that we can t live without    these ideas are all worked into this film nicely   but done in a way that is not heavy handed at all   but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating    the focus of this film   and the reason for making it   it seems   was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images   and scenes which are blatantly over stylized    the tone of the book is a comical one   but it s also a tragic one   and humbert   telling the story from his perspective   blows every single thing out of perspective    humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires   and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed    we get a sense that perhaps it s by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed    he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14 year old love   and allows himself to embody her as lolita    he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions   and by the end   he has nothing but overly dramatic feelings for her    the story recognizes the extreme of this   almost out of a test   seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert   and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author   vladimir nabokov   wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions   and perhaps bring them to peace    the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end   when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey   we can easily sympathize and even identify with him    the opening and final images of the film are the same   and who hasn t done a similar action   that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us    this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen   the first time being filmed in   shock   1962   by stanley kubrick   who couldn t possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do   but did the next best thing   he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general    in that film   he used the traps of society as benefits    the studio demanded the final scene   that of a heinous murder   come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile       and  when you see it   it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession    the censors wouldn t allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the   um   relationship between humbert and lolita   so kubrick decided to play it as comedy   but still allow the tragedy to seep through    looking at these two versions   especially after reading the novel   and we all know that when we ve read a novel and see a film adaptation   we are bound to be angered by any size differences     it s really impossible to compare them    they both go for different things   and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was    and although it s true that several scenes are similar   and are thus up for comparison   overall it s unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse    i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is   and i won t say that here    however   this film is pretty amazing   mostly because hey   i loved the book   and this film nearly reminded me of it    it doesn t have nearly as much wit   a couple comical scenes   and even a lot of good chuckles   but just not totally witty     but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had    some of that is in the casting of the two leads    jeremy irons   with his deep   soft british voice and gentle look   is an amazing humbert    he s droll in a very unique way   and   well   no one can look distraught the way he does    he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience    and when he looks at lolita with love   and she looks at him with lust   you know that he s her prisoner for as long as he lives    and dominique swain   who plays the title character   is rather incredible    she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original   wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction   bratiness   and self centeredness that marks the character    it s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert   she loves the attention   and knows that she can have her way with him at any time    when he denies her something   she blackmails him effortlessly   a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic     and when he stands up to her   she weeps and runs away   leaving humbert to follow her    there are two other minor characters in the film   one who s a road block in the beginning   and the other who s a reappearing threat to the relationship    the former is charlotte   lolita s mother   played by melanie griffith    in the book   charlotte is a monster of a woman   overbearing   constantly scolding her child   overly religious   and ultimately selfish    and she s the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal   at least in the beginning    as played by shelly winters in the original   she represented all these qualities   as played by griffith here   she s about half of them    it s annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first    and even though griffith is not really bad   persay   she s nothing more    the other is clare quilty   the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita   and succeeds   but at a price    langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original    quilty was a comic character in the original   a threat in the form of many forms   popping in states of rambling   german   proning   and eventually drunk    langella takes the other route   allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed   and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots   and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending   the exact opposite of what we thought of him    as you can see   most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter   stephen schiff   but just parts of a whole new look at the novel   at least cinema wise    this version is beautiful   and perpetually saddening    the camera movements are stylized   and each shot is breathtakingly rich    the acting is for the most part wonderful   and when we watch it   we really get a sense that for humbert   who is telling the story   the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita    more importantly   it takes us right up the brink of emotion   then jumps right over it    by the end   with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car   following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn t regret   we feel that we all lose to something we can never have    
Pos, not too many people know who james whale is   but it s a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies    if we are to believe the semi  biographical gods and monsters   whale would have wanted it to be that way    this is an insightful   haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director   and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie    gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale s life because it tracks only the final few days of his life   and it s probably a better movie for it    it s focus is on whale s   ian mckellen   untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone   brendan fraser      it begins with whale   a fairly talented artist   aside from being a director   asking boone to   sit for him       pose for a portrait      at first   boone doesn t realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man    when he does discover whale s sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid   lynn redgrave     he is frightened   refusing to sit for the guy    but he comes back   only to storm out again   disgusted with whale s   locker room talk      boone returns yet another time   after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned   locker room talk     and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening    meanwhile   jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago    his ailment leads to desperation and depression   which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor    what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser s bravura performance   up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in   blast from the past   for example      i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here    this is impressive because his character s dialogue is minimal   with mckellan doing most of the talking    that requires fraser to act through body language   a difficult skill to master   but something he proves capable of doing well    this is not to ignore mckellan s oscar nominated turn    he earned that nomination with his touching performance here   although   at the risk of sounding like a philistine   i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination     an understated   compelling gem    whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre   and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield    he rejoiced in being free from it   only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people    in the end   perhaps   it is what killed him   the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare       1999 eugene novikov&#137    
Pos, since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they re portraying   it s fitting to say that   beloved   come as a real shock as a film    it s confusing   bizarre   and as tough a film to watch as any film i ve seen all year   and that s not necessarily because of the three hour running time       beloved   is challenging to watch   filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard   and instead of a straight forward   hollywood ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed     beloved   comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened   or   rather   toni morrison   who wrote the novel upon which this is based         beloved   tells the story of an ex slave named sethe   played by oprah winfrey   who lives on a large farm in the north with her children    when the film opens   her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist   which shakes things up   wounds the dog   and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family    sethe is proud   though   and will not move    her sons run away   leaving only her and her daughter   denver   kimberly elise   alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation    a couple years pass   and the ghost remains   and one day   a man named paul d   danny glover     another ex slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together   arrives   asking for lodging    he has been wandering around since he left the plantation   and when he enters the house   it turns red and becomes incredibly hot    when he remarks about what he thinks is evil   sethe replies   it ain t evil    it s just sad      some more time passes   and paul d has become a fervent member of the household   and the ghost disappears    but when they return one day from going out   they discover a young woman sitting in the house    her name is beloved   and as played by thandie newton   she has almost zero motor skills    she stumbles around   half grabbing onto things and knocking them over   and when she speaks   she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk    they let her into her house   and she begins to turn things upside down       beloved   acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story    most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic   low lit room   with the occasional flash to the past   where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern day psychoanalysts    sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation   which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands   with her nipples being licked   prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it     they took my milk !    worst of all was the month after her freedom   when she was allowed to live like a free person   working with other blacks on a farm   and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back    she runs to the barn near by   carrying her four children   and when her old owners burst in   they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don t leave them alone    when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film   she says she doesn t regret it    she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did   and she has convinced herself she did the right thing    of course   beloved is really her daugher materialized   though we aren t flat out told that until later on in the film    beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long    thus     beloved   becomes a sorta redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci fi classic     solaris     where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife   who commited suicide years before   has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system    that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories   how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past   and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us   it would control us completely       beloved   moves along freely   without a lot of explanation   and for the most part   this is extremely respectable    the most interesting films are the ones that don t explain everything for us   leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense    sethe is never fully explained as a character   but we understand all her actions since she s being played by oprah winfrey    it s been well over a decade since her last major performance in   the color purple     but judging from these two films   i ll bet she s one of the best actresses working today       if  she was strictly an actress    her talk show   which i suppose is a great entity   has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress   and that s a shame because she brings so much to this movie    emotion    sadness    strength    watching the strong sethe   who s so afraid of the past that she s built a rather strong protective coating around herself   break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great    she makes it real    that s not to say this is a perfect film    in fact   i d wager to say that the fact that it s confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is    while oprah s performance is powerful and easily sympathetic   and i m dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february     the structure of the film   which doesn t show what happened to her children till halfway through the film   prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film    it doesn t necessarily move as though they re memories of one particular character   and by the end   it has lost control over sethe   and as she takes to bed   we are unable to truly identify with her anymore    but despite its tediousness   perhaps that s the point    the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start   since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable   and it needs to get back with reality    and for the most part   this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be    jonathan demme s direction is bizarre   in nature with the story   and he creates the right mood   making it a tough film to sit through   making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters    there s more to admire here   like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization   just like they would be in real life   and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering   but laced with a touch of optimism    the acting   not only from winfrey   is amazing   and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination    everyone has been raving about thandie newton s performance   and how it should be rewarded    however   it must be noted that out of everyone   she had the easiest part    act like a baby    throw things    stumble around    chew food with your mouth open    i do think there s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation   but it s kimberly elise   as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane   and has to carry the burden of her mother s loss of reality towards the end    it s not that newton isn t great   she s as annoying and wacky as the role demands    it s just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better    despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it   and not that of writer morrison or director demme     beloved   has still not done well    costing   i think   around ninety million dollars   it has since grossed about twenty two    unfortunately   this film is a little too intense for viewers   even for me   and i can stand almost anything   i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic   caligula     the worst film i have ever seen in my life   and did it in a mere 2 sittings      although i respect   beloved     i can t say that i really enjoyed it    
Neg, susan granger s review of   jeepers creepers     mgm/ua entertainment    this nasty   little horror film begins as a bickering brother   justin long   and sister   gina philips   are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped up bodies down a drainage pipe    when long decides to investigate   there s nothing but trouble       you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it      well   this is it !    philips warns    what he finds in the basement of an old   abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying   jagged stitched incision from his neck to his navel   plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies   stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry    long flees but now the monstrous   winged creeper   jonathan breck   is after both of them !  eileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle   a psychic who explains the evil creature s bizarre feeding habits    on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10     jeepers creepers   is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion   giving new meaning to the old song   jeepers creepers      and now   as paul harvey would say   for the rest of the story    what s more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writer/director victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 year old actor in california    sentenced to three years in prison   he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992    when salva made   powder     1995     the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities   disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as a pedophile    and now   once again   in this mgm/ua film   that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio    
Neg, synopsis   sullen julie james   still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer   perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas    arriving at the start of the hurricane season   julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they ve walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand    comments   i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here   but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series   party of five      i am only vaguely aware of the show s premise   and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half paid attention to while watching the tube       party of five     i do know however   seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre    neve campbell   scream queen of the 90s and star of scream   scream 2   and the craft   is a regular of the show    so too is jennifer love hewitt    lo and behold   following in the footsteps of campbell   hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own   the i know what you did last summer line    though the original film   released last year   was watchable enough   this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater s glowing red exit sign longingly throughout    jennifer love hewitt is a very good looking young leading lady   however   unlike neve campbell   hewitt struggles with acting    she just isn t convincing in this film   and she wasn t in the original either      this puts many young males   including myself   in a paradoxical quandary   she s very attractive   but the annoying   spoiled   valley girl type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize   exploitatively   her figure    add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy   another rising teen tv star   and you get one frustrated male audience    i ve spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason    i still know what you did last summer   though cashing in on the success of the original   ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses    nothing else here is original or interesting    this movie   in fact   makes other recent so so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter s vampires seem like stunning works of high art    i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches   an isolated location   a storm   parentless teenagers   false alarm nightmares   lots of blue lighted darkness scenes   a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him   knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere   etc   you get the picture    the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer s hook    they may as well have huge targets painted on them    like scream and its numerous knockoffs   these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief    unfortunately   i still know s characters aren t all that funny    in particular   one character   a chain weed smoking guy   is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn t die soon enough    the death scenes   by the way   are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film    several of them are uncomfortable to watch   and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser   bloodline   a truly sadistic movie    this   too   did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for    and what is the deal with the slasher himself    i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre   but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror    come on   the guy looks like the gorton s fisherman   and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate    though his lightning lit appearances ellicited much needed laughter in the theater   his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film   and that s * really * saying something    so   all that s left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy    both prance about in tightfitting   revealing outfits or in various states of undress   yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene    hewitt   however   does do a post shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite           titillating    this scene alone made this one star turkey earn two stars under my rating system    otherwise   hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves    early in the film   for instance   brandy wins the trip to the bahamas    she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever    i needed extra strength tylenol after that part    oh   and the film s conclusion   talk about repetitive !  people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know s ending at least 5 minutes before it happens    boring !  i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater    admission is only one dollar on wednesdays   and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them    it s usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience   who don t seem to mind participating in a mass   mystery science theater 3000    type viewing    i still know what you did last summer   however   produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience   underscoring how bad it * really * is    if it weren t for the main actresses  revealing wardrobes   i d have had a very   very hard time sitting through this lame sequel    i can t imagine trying to watch it on video   horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation   and wouldn t recommend it to people   unless they re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy    i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works    what a depressing thought    hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act    rated r   this film contains lots of violence   several gory scenes   and a couple nubile   horny teenagers  though the sex act itself is always thwarted    i d say this is unsuitable for kids   but teens wouldn t have a problem sitting through it   especially since they obviously compose the film s target audience    
Pos, taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking   go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers    the story centres around a group of people   who include brit simon   askew     and checkout girls claire   holmes   and ronna   polley   and the misadventures that they get into   split into three chapters    everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers    although qt s touch is evident in nearly every frame   go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride    liman   who also photographed the film   has a deft touch with the camera   and the film looks good    the film also seems to have benefited from a budget   with the night club scenes in particular looking pretty good    there s a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk    the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life    holmes   one of the dawson s creek cast   a show i m not particularly fond of   displays much talent here   and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature    askew is slightly successful   being rather obnoxious    no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him   but instead of  funny annoying  he s just annoying    he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters   but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it    the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl   her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining    also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer   who gives an nice evil performance    the script   written john august   is sharp and witty   with good dialogue and some funny jokes    it starts off rather slow however   but in about twenty minutes the script has found it s footing and just keeps getting better    the stories are largely satisfying   although occasionally there s too much attention on one detail but not on another    also   some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky    still   the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it    it could of tried a little harder in some parts however   and these parts lag    because this is a gen xer movie   the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany   and go s one is pretty decent    unlike other gen xers movies   go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue   which is a plus    go is a very easy movie to absorb into   and the audience really starts feeling for these characters    thankfully   they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics   like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you      they are who they are and they stay that way    go is great fun   and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers    ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things   and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride    erm   go to go   i guess    
Neg, to sum the entire film   54   up in one sentence   it would be   watch a vh1 documentary instead       54     seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978   brought him into studio 54   got him really drunk   told him to write about it   and then dumbed that down to be released to the public    a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex   drugs   and disco    the narrator   shane o shae   ryan phillippe     works as a grease monkey in new jersey who   of course   on a whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio   54      phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young   attractive actor with a six pack stomach    he is let in by steve rubbell   mike myers     the infamous co owner of studio 54   because he is attractive    he eventually becomes a bus boy and then a bartender            you expected more   didn t you    there isn t    the film builds up from nothing and becomes nothing as it s climax   isn t that an apt word for studio 54   lands with a thud    the glitz of the club and perpetually semi clothed patrons are used in an to attempt to show the it s glamour    for much of its target audience   college age to early thirties   it attempts to show celebrities mixing with   normal people      this even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced are andy warhol and truman capote    you can be sure that half of the audience hasn t heard of them   another quarter only know their names   and the other quarter knew they were there already    the humor   if you can call it that   is built on an eighty year old woman getting high and 70s references like john travolta and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back then  the best performance in the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high   sexually ambivlaent   very new york steve rubell    he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive    he looks like rubell and sounds just like him while giving a subdued   almost nostalgic performance   when needed    it reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on   coffee talk   sans dress and wig    the supporting cast of salma hayek   breckin meyer   and neve cambell are their only there to give added subplots which are introduced but lead absolutely nowhere    the romance between phillippe and cambell   as a soap opera star   is completely implausable    the two share about half as much screen time as there are shots of the eighty year old hooked on amphetimenes    hayek s wanna be singer seems extremely forced and her husband   greg   meyer   stands in as shane o shae s surrogate best friend    the subplots seemed forced and seem like they have been added just to make sure the film was over an hour and a half long    overall     54   tried to give a view of the brashness of the place where crack flowed like heroin which flowed like wine    the film never leads to anything   has no obserable point   and covers up a lack of real plot with a veil of beautiful people    in truth   that reminded me of the eighies    
Pos, usually when a blockbuster comes out   it s loaded with effects   stars   bad scripts   and plenty of action    mystery men may contain an all star cast   and efects   but the clever script and characters are what really works   which is rare to see this year    the film is based upon the comic book series   the flaming carrot   by bob burden   in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime   only to be out done by the real hero of champion city   captain amazing   greg kinnear      things go a little haywire   when the sinister casanova frankenstein   geoffrey rush   is released into the city   where he captures captain amazing   and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city    well   the trio decide to take matters in their own hands   by saving the city   but first they need some assitance    this is where the film takes a turn for the better    in the beggining   there were only 3 wanna be heroes       blue raja   hank azaria       mr   furious   ben stiller   and   the shoveller   william h   macy      sure they were enterataining   but their acts grew old fast    that is until they aquire   invisible boy     kel mitchell     and   the bowler     janeane garafalo   and   mr   splein     paul reubens     2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess    thankfully   the original 3 heroes become amusing   with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen    the whole premise is rather ridiculous   but packs a few punches to keep interest    for one   the film is considerably clever    it literally pokes fun at super hero films   like batman and robin   superman etc   in fact   many scenes are similar to batman and robin   including the opening sequence   only altered in a humorous and superior way    a part of the cleverness comes from the cast    sometimes a film with such talent is overblown   but the acting is what keeps it alive here    while azaria and macy were enteratining   2 characters really stood out    one was paul reuben    no matter how disgusting or revolting   mr   splein   may be   you still can t help but laugh    it  so incredibly moronic   it s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions    janeane garafalo also was an interesting character    she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem   due to her enthusiasm   that kept the film flowing    men is worth seeing alone   for those 2 troubled heroes    on the downside   a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off    kel mitchell and geoffrey rush   were both utterly useless    their parts were so limited   they d be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes    ben stiller too was wasted   mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue    none of these characters get a rise out of anybody   but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film    as far as the budget goes   it was wisely spent on the cast   not the effects    while the set designs and action all look nice   i m glad there was a seperate aspect   that the film focused on   and for that i applaud    slow at times   and rather pointless   mystery men still delivers    it forgets about money making   because it s not likely to make a bundle like it s proceeders   and that s what works    stupid    maybe   but for once i m not disappointed    no one expected an intelligent film   but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year    
Neg, warning   may contain slight mild spoilers    rated   r for intense violence/gore   some strong sexuality and language    starring   arnold schwarzeneggar   robin tunney   rod stieger   gabriel byrne    running time   132 minutes  we go into a movie theater   boom !  the lights go down   our hearts race   we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we ve been waiting to see for a long time comes on    we sit there   watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is    why shouldn t i have know what i was getting myself into    again like this past summers hit   stigmata       end of days   may be worse    it s not like this is any kind of original idea   it just throws in some   rosemary s baby     along with   the devil s advocate   a little   exorcist   and some   stigmata   here and there    whala you have   end of days   a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific    sadly but truly again like most recent films   all the good parts are in the trailers    the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend   and flop in the next    jericho cane   arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role   is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan   living in gabriel byrnes body   and stop him from impregnating christine york   robin tunney   because if he does   and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist    he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000   and strangely he s trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes    he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger   in a terrific role   and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that s satisfying   but turns into a typical action movie    that s pretty much it on plot    it does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie   and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it   parts you have to wonder where all the money went    as for arnie    good role   ok performance    i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts    the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film    in the trailers it looks like a good scary   action film and ends up being a boring   long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions    gabriel byrnes   who ironically played a priest in   stigmata     here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character    two years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun   the devil s advocate   and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also    robin tunney   great performance as always   plays satan s main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child    of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn t nothing new    the direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown   though not nearly as the visual style was in   stigmata      here we are given great camera work   and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just don t work in this movie    the script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines   but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home    only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances   the writing and visual style   but the storyline and the finished product don t work as well    the sad thing is that   end of days   had so many things going for it    the plot could have been more organized   the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind numbing    at times it seems like   armageddon   and started to get old and tiresome    hollywood is running out of ideas bad   and like i ve always said before needs new ones    even with its 100m budget   end of days   is less than pleasing    in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over   and easily could have had a 70m budget    maybe i sound crazy   but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film   and hope that they make it as good as the original    we need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the box office    we need to get more films like   the blair witch project   that could scare people to death   while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do i know that it is in fact the blair witch    overblown effects   stupid and thin plot line   good performances   disappointing         umm  yup those pretty much describe   end of days      
Neg, when critics attack seemingly well intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do   their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry e mails   sometimes even mock death threats from those who   i suppose   like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment    even politicians   !    tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good hearted films while praising   filth   like pulp fiction    these [fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic s job is to review the movie   not the message   however sweet and endearing that message may be    thusly patch adams isn t a bad film because it s about a doctor who cares for his patients   it s a bad film because it s a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation    similarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place   though i even doubt that   stay tuned   an explanation is forthcoming     it s still an unpleasantly maudlin mess    the picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher   a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey     with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude   who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world    12 year old trevor   haley joel osmet     a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother   helen hunt     comes up with the notion to pay it forward   this entails a person doing one good deed   call it an uber favor   for three others   then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we re all living in a frank capra movie    meanwhile in a parallel story   a weasely reporter   jay mohr   tracks the   movement   which has apparently begun to grow    pay it forward has odd ideas about tone   at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core    it s as if director mimi leder didn t have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended   and compromised out of fear that her film wasn t   gutsy   enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for    so the picture adds grit   a child molester propositions trevor   a homeless man returns to heroin after being   saved     a character is knifed while doing a good deed   etc   though it seems shallow   incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn t quite sure if it s ready to buy into its own utopian blather    pay it forward offers   crowd pleasing   elements for general audiences   jay mohr s umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball   angie dickinson s earthy alcoholic bag woman   and the jive talking   black hoodlum with a heart of gold     coming on the heals of the black   god like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled   this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich      hurray for hollywood   who actually calls the mohr character a   nigga   and says things like   can you feel me      leave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment       maybe spike s flick wasn t so misguided after all      these scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you ll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings    while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place   to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience    it s a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration   with the main players   all previous oscar winners or nominees   given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns    one scene in which a slightly de glamed helen hunt   de glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama]   hunt s hair is also natty and badly bleached   verbally castigates spacey   feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip    spacey   of course   responds in his cultured monotone   that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance    maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating   though how can he not   even when he s emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference    the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender    in one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet   immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke   and with said hand still on said mouth   she actually begins convulsing   dry heaving really     then   and i m not making this up   she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol    the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow ups   it s all very theatrical   especially hunt s performance   which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar    pay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn t get academy awards    the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists    even haley joel osemt   the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense   seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections    his acting has become broader   less intimate   it s as if we can make out the little munchkin s thoughts     boy this outta floor em      naturally osmet is made to play one of those only in the movies children   a martyr figure who cleans up after his mother   lectures her on the ills of drinking   and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher    never mind that the two couldn t be more dissimilar   his mother is trailer trash dopey   and the teacher is one of those dennis miller ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary    nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap ish cornball antics    but oh how we love bright   articulate   self sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life    they re so adorable    of course the blame can t all be hoisted onto the actors   though with the exception of the little kid   they probably should have known better     instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder   who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er   then went on to make two awful genre films in a row    the first being the peacemaker   a witless post cold war george clooney vehicle   and deep impact   one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth s possible demise by a crazed meteorite    the first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich   s   and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement   not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out   apparently present for an invisible audience      deep impact has more in common with pay it forward   it s a movie that treats earth s impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms   completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days    the film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing   though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching    in pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal     see my movie isn t as na   ve as you might think   she seems to be saying    no   it s just horribly confused    
Pos, when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called   the postman     i thought     an american version of  il postino      starring costner    god help us !    when i found out that it was not a remake of   postino   but an postapocalyptic epic   i thought      landworld      please   god   make him stop !    as it turns out     the postman   is a much better film than i had expected    despite being set in 2013   the movie is   at heart   a western   a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers   a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back    the setting   however   allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance   american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars   and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages    the struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it    costner s nameless character   a wandering actor   rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem   will patton     a former copy machine salesman turned bandit king    our hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman    taking the uniform and bag of mail   he passes himself off as a representative of   the restored united states      he is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets    one young disciple   ford lincoln mercury   larenz tate     organizes a full scale postal service    ford spreads the postman s message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule    as war breaks out between bethlehem s army and the postal workers   costner s character steps into the legend he created and goes from self centered loner to leader of the revolution    his lie of the restored united states becomes a self fulfilling prophecy       postman   is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wide eyed optimism   sort of   sergio leone meets frank capra       but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling    what could have been another knock off of   the road warrior     like   waterworld   was   surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble    tate is the stand out in the movie s large cast    ford lincoln mercury   self named   is the polar opposite of o dog   tate s character in his debut film     menace ii society     1993     and tate makes ford s innocent belief in hope as convincing as o dog s cynicism and brutality    his performance sells the movie    interestingly   as tate moves from his usual street smart roles to youthful optimism   the soft eyed patton   who usually plays nice guys   proves a disarming villain    olivia williams makes her film debut as the postman s love interest   abby    when they first meet   abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile    predictably   the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits   and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero    however   their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored   she   torn by grief   guilt   and anger   he   resisting his destiny         the postman   is costner s best work thus far    perhaps that alone gives us hope for the future            
Pos, expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into a feature length film and you ve got baby s day out  an agreeably amusing children s comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant    the plot tracks a trio of crooks posed as photographers   mantegna   pantoliano   haley   who steal nine month old bennington august cottwell iv   aka baby bink   from his old money home    but the plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window and into the streets of downtown chicago !  following the path of his favorite story   called   baby s day out     baby rides a bus and visits the zoo and winds up at a skyscraper construction site    while baby stays unscathed   the crooks fare worse for the wear    the stooges get hit by boards and dropped from roofs and   of course   suffer multiple crotch injuries       john wayne bobbitt should probably steer clear of this one      like he did in planes   trains   and automobiles   john hughes again demonstrates his mastery of the simple set up and extended execution    here   he s aided and abetted by a director   patrick read johnson   whose choreography could rival a coen brother    best bit   baby crawling across a busy city street    baby s day out has only two emotions  awww and ouch  and the actors play them accordingly    forget the cartoon concern of lara flynn boyle or cynthia nixon   disposable as mom and nanny   respectively   the ones to watch are the ones who are wincing    joe mantegna is a great head stooge   barking lines like   that little doo doo machine is my retirement money      brian haley has a great scene with a gorilla   while joe pantolianto plays curly to mantegna s moe     * he * is funny    needless to say   twins adam and jacob warton are adorable beyond belief    
Pos, first   i am not a big fan of the x files tv series    i have nothing against it particularly   i just don t happen to watch it    having said that   i can now say that i liked the x files pretty well    for us non fans   there s nothing big going for it   but there are a lot of little things    the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35   000 b   c    two proto humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside    the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien    the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy   lucas black   from sling blade   is captured by the same black ooze    we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder   gillian anderson and david duchovny     who have been pulled off of their previous assignment   investigations into the paranormal   and put onto the bomb squad detail    a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas   texas    on a hunch   mulder checks out the building across the street   and   wouldn t you know it   he turns out to be right    the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse    five people die in the blast   and when mulder learns who the victims were   a light bulb goes on over his head    the two agents team up to investigate   against fbi orders   the links mulder has made    their search leads them back to the north texas cave   all across the country   and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to   the truth      the plot   and   the truth     are uninspired    i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me    it didn t    the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them    but the point of the x files is not what the truth is   but the extent to which it has been hidden    it s a slightly more interesting angle   but it still raises expectations about that   truth   too high    if this were the whole film   i would say the movie was mediocre   perhaps even boring    but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it    the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest    before the audience can get tired of one location   the agents follow a hot tip to another location   and so on and so forth    the locations are not all computer generated sets   either    there are some artificial settings   but the desert night of nevada   the edge of suburbia in texas   and the endless fields of snow in antarctica   actually somewhere in north america      make this fantastic film feel more real    ward russell s cinematography is very good    the overall look is dark and ominous   appropriate to the intended tone of the film s plot    russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding    when the movie is set in darkness   the picture quality is still rich and detailed    finally   and specifically   there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train    i don t know if the shot is faked in any way   but it looks dangerous   and it looks great    the movie s soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film     skip  to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie   there is a spoiler in the following sentences     during the opening prehistoric sequence   a howling wind dogs the soundtrack   never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound    in one of the movie s most effective sequences   metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees    the visuals of the scene are good   but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound    there was no question as to who the movie s stars would be    even so   duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination    both are easy on the eyes and together   they have some good timing   banter   and energy    there is a hint of chemistry between them   but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship    they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street    there might be some romantic interest   but for now they re more interested in their environs than they are in each other    no single element really makes this movie outstanding   not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular    but enough things were done right that the x files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along    
Pos, glory  starring matthew broderick   denzel washington   and morgan freeman  is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts   the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war    broderick plays robert gould shaw   the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle    shaw   the son of well to do abolitionists   hailed from boston high society    the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard   and were   evidently   the inspiration for glory    as the film begins in 1862   shaw is a captain in the northern forces    like private eriksson   michael j   fox   in casualties of war   shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war  that is   until his company is attacked by enemy forces    shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle   witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck    soon after his recovery   shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort    glory is the story not only of colonel shaw   but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery    the film periodically jumps between shaw s point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers    the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits   and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action    the large black cast is uniformly outstanding   especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth    he is brash and pushy   always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight    his bitter   tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability    washington provides much of the film s intensity and emotional power    in one heartbreaking scene   he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army    when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment   you cringe at the sight of his back   which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave    it makes your blood boil    the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings   a tear rolls down washington s cheek  and will probably run down your cheek as well    the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn t deserting the army at all   he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores    freeman is   as usual   a strong presence   even in a small supporting role    he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember    he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers   holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers    colonel shaw recognizes freeman s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major   making him the first black officer in the army    andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles   a free black who is one of shaw s close childhood friends    searles is educated and refined   like a white man   prompting washington to nickname him   snow flake      the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat    the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment    the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships   but somehow they never lose their morale    the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens   subjecting them to racism and discrimination    they are paid only $10 a month   whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen   and   for a long time   they have to go without shoes   guns   or uniforms    to make matters worse   the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action   preferring instead to use them for manual labor    eventually   however   the regiment receives its boots   uniforms   rifles   and right to fight   thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw    shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers   and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve   even if it means threatening a general with blackmail    broderick   in fact   is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment    unfortunately   however   broderick s uneven performance is   in many respects   the weak link in the movie    in an effort to look more mature   broderick sports a mustache and a goatee   and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent    he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced    the film places too much weight on broderick s character and not enough on the black soldiers   who are more intriguing    glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war    the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july    glory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts    except for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head   the film   for the most part   leaves the gore to your imagination   which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid    to the contrary   they are chaotic and horrifying   it s just that director edward zwick   the co creator of   thirtysomething     films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster    the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers    the movie depicts some of   but not enough of   their customs and rituals    in one scene   for example   the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire    each man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration    a couple of the movie s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe   disbelief and pride    the regiment s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle   thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner    like any war film   glory has its share of gloom and despair   but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson   a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say   or   more precisely   what they do not say     blacks played a critically important role in the north s victory over the south  forever changing the evolution of america    
Neg, i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard    the problem is   i can t remember them as i write this review    that s not a good sign    in booty call   jamie foxx is bunz   a character whom i can t really describe   because i don t know that much about him    i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk   and that he doesn t like relationships   just   booty calls   at three in the morning   no questions   no commitment      bunz has a best friend named rushon   tommy davidson     who seems to be bunz s direct opposite   on the straight and narrow   and currently in a long term commitment   a whole seven weeks   wow !      rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend   nikki   tamala jones     but for a reason which is not totally explained   it s going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki s friend lysterine   vivica a   fox     who have never met    to make a long story short   the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki s obsession with safe sex    first she wants condoms   so bunz and rushon go out and get them    oh   no   they have to be latex   not lambskin    back to the store    now they ve got to get dental dams   or there ll be no foreplay    why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand    nikki phones lysterine   who lives across the hall   and tells her she d better be making these demands   too    talk about coitus interruptus    booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over the top comedies    the difference between the two is that in the latter   things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality    in this category   for example   you have ace ventura   private eye on the mild side   and airplane !  at the extreme    there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status   but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention    it is disappointing   and even worse   distracting    there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker   are those real names      does not live up to its potential   as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing    for instance   there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant    bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese   much to everyone s surprise    however   when asked how he learned the language   he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late night kung fu films   and soon gained mastery    this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene    if   on the other hand   when asked how he learned to speak chinese   bunz simply replied with     kung fu movies     and then moved on   the joke would have been much more effective    this is because it would have been totally unbelievable   but funny because we know it is unbelievable    by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible   the film is not giving its viewers enough credit    the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions    why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends    why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine    if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex   why doesn t she have some condoms at her own apartment    these questions are not answered by the screenplay   but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward    a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language    some movies use a lot of swear words   but use them under very justifiable circumstances   as when they are employed consistent with a character s pattern of speech    other films   such as the recent jackie brown   use them in ways that almost parody themselves    booty call just sticks them in to get laughs   and it doesn t work    they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them    half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason    the chinese restaurant   a holdup at a convenience store   and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story   and are in there for filler    this is surprising   considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long    it s too bad that the core of the film isn t much better   since it is comprised of sometimes funny   but forgettable dialog    i refer you to the first paragraph of this review    
Neg, i m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone    sure   she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god s green earth   second only to that movie critic at large guy     but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in   she always strikes out    the crush was a slow moving   predictable piece of fluff    hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in    clueless was an annoying   unfunny waste of time    and people have e mailed me too   saying clueless is a good movie and that i m the only one who doesn t like it    one girl said if i d seen the movie with   an open mind     i would have enjoyed it    nothing could be further from the truth    i went into the theater expecting to love the movie    the preview looked good and of course i m crazymadinlove with alicia   but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny   unlikable characters    almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way    when we were walking out of the theater   one guy   and it wasn t me   yelled out     that was the worst f$&#in  movie i ve ever seen   and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement    so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia s pretty face on the cover of some made for video thriller called the babysitter    i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway    what i got was 90 minutes of regret  the worst alicia silverstone movie ever    and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like    where to begin in criticizing this movie    the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier   the writing could have been done   and for all we know it was   by a ten year old   alicia is the star and she s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever    there is zero humor   zero suspense   zero drama and zero action   until the last ten minutes   when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence    zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero    so why does this movie get one star out of me    well   alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub    and if it wasn t bubble bath   the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four  star features   but you settle for what you can get    alicia plays a babysitter who s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party    and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home   at least that movie critic at large guy does      as the movie trods along   we discover she s not only the mostly silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character s fantasies   and probably every male viewer s too      the drunken father thinks she s just the thing to recapture his lost youth   her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside   even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she s taking her bubble bath    they even throw in the middle aged wife s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party    not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy    at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg rated    in fact   i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late night staple if not for the fact that there s absolutely no nudity in it    so you can t call it a sex flick    i ve already pointed out that it can t fall under drama   comedy   thriller or action   so what do you classify the babysitter as    bad    
Neg, i saw this film on christmas day expecting an upbeat comedy    boy was i in for a christmas dissapointment !  after an hour of the movie   i was ready to change rooms into another theater !  read on to see what i have to say          four rooms    starring   tim roth   jennifer beals   antonio banderas   quentin tarantino   valeria golino   madonna   bruce willis   marisa tomei   alicia witt   lili taylor   and ione skye    possible stars       four rooms   was supposed to be one of the biggest hits of the year    key word here     supposed      four of the biggest directors in hollywood   quentin tarantino   robert rodriguez   alexander rockwell   and alison anders were all directing one big film with a big and popular cast    i guess it was all just too much because this turned out to be the biggest flop of the year and it could of been great    the plot   it s new years eve and it s a bellboy s first day on the job    he encounters many mysterious and kinky hotel guests as he tries to handle all his own problems    tarantino told his directors this plot   and each of them wrote a script    it turned out each of them had written a dark comedy    anders wrote and directed the tale about a coven of witches   madonna   valeria golino   alicia witt   and ione skye     which was the worst one out of all of them    the second room   jennifer beals   was better   but lacking in plot    this room was about a man who accuses every man of sleeping with his wife    the third room   antonio banderas   was the best roomm   about two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel suite    the final one   tarantino   willis   was about a movie star wanting the bellboy to chop off someone s finger    the movie was just plain trash    there was nothing here that even makes up a quality film    it was not funny   and i didn t hear one laugh in the theater throughout the whole film    tim roth is horrible as the bumbling and mumbling bellboy   and he ruins every joke in the film    the supporting cast loses meaning to the word support and the only mentionable actors/actresses are antonio banderas and jennifer beals    marisa tomei appears in a stupid cameo role    this movie is the worst film of the year and the film could have been great   perhaps like a more upbeat   plaza suite     but it wasn t    as trashy as it was   some people will call it classic    do you call a man chopping off a finger with madonna s chest showing a classic film    look for more of ken s kritic korner coming soon !  please check the newsgroups under the movie reviews section for updated reviews    p   s     four rooms   made number 1 on my top ten worst list of 1995    
Pos, ladies and gentlemen   1997 s independence day is here !  it s title   starship troopers    and surprisingly   it is more entertaining than id4    i realize that i gave last year s sci fi hit a 4 star rating   but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour    after subsequent viewings   i feel that independence day really wasn t as great as it seemed  though i still give it a positive review    starship troopers   on the other hand   has a mocking sense of humor   knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem    as a result   starship troopers is a more exciting   energetic   and lively science fiction film    in fact   i probably could never get tired of watching this film    starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars   another kick ass space opera which reinvented the sci fi drama altogether    while starship troopers is no star wars   it comes quite close   and the easiest assessment would be to call this film     the  star wars  of the 90s      am i being to generous to this film    perhaps   but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance   effectively   into the warring races    in essence   this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction    the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films   and i may have to    starship troopers is not quite an original film persay   but director paul verhoeven gives the film a   kick the aliens  asses   style    id4 had this same style   except it was forced   most likely the cause of will smith having a major role    this new   star wars   has a very simple   basic plot   mankind vs   an alien species    the alien species in question here is the bugs   a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid type insects    however   the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy    sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes   but during quiet moments   we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization    more than likely   these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends    and they should be    i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought provoking film    this is an   event   film   but surprisingly above average    it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci fi war film   and actually root for the human side   something independence day never achieved      starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange   join the army   ads    mixing a web based interface   these summations of events are refreshingly original    stating     would you like to know more        these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor   and we know we should not take it seriously    however   we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle   in a gory   yet funny   way    after witnessing the slaughter   the film jumps back one year   to setup what we just saw    we are introduced to johnny rico   casper van dien   and carmen ibanez   denise richards      rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms    however   carmen isn t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot    however   another classmate   dizzy flores   dina meyer     has her eye on rico    unfortunately   rico isn t interested in dizzy    this setup is rather cliched   as is the result of the setup   but it still is fun to watch    carmen signs up to become a starship trooper   and as a result   rico signs up    and as a result   dizzy signs up    everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy   carmen gets the pilot position she wanted   carl jenkins   neil patrick harris     a psychic   gets a position in the training program   and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers   the mobile infantry    the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships    in reality   i found myself watching a space version of   melrose place     but with better special effects    an hour into the film   the war begins    a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with    the first hour may have been a funny   sometimes unintentionally   setup   but we grew to care for the flat characters   because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters   their gorgeous looks won me over   call me superficial   if you must      following the training sessions   which had many dramas in themselves   too many to mention here     the troopers are sent to war    the bugs live on the planet klendathu   a planet which consists of dirt and rock   and pretty much nothing else    many dramas occur during the war   until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs  attacks    a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense    the troopers are ordered to locate the   brain   and capture it    i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible   because starship troopers is not about plot    it s about special effects and gory violence    director verhoeven   most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct   returns to his sci fi days   which gave us good films like total recall    verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa   but despite all the violence   the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood    starship troopers is extremely violent   with more gore than this year s event horizon    the r rating is well deserved   and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it    my guess is that verhoeven s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group    the film has a testosterone level off the charts   with chiseled men and beautiful women    despite these superficial elements   starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful    while watching the film   we never second guess the character s decisions because they seem perfectly clear    thankfully   no hero is punching aliens in the face   which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with    the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with   but they soon grow on you    casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon    to most guys   he will come across as artificial    fortunately   van dien is the worst of the cast   despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character    dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character    her dizzy is extremely likeable    denise richards also does a good job   and her scenes are very well done    jake busey   gary busey s son   gives a wonderfully funny performance   and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film    neil patrick harris   remember   he was doogie howser   is a little wooden   and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast    however   he does give a good performance    michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm    his performance rises above the rest    perhaps it is because his character is the most developed   but i think it is just ironside s presence on screen    unfortunately   no particular cast member gives a star making performance   which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars    director verhoeven is the main star of the film    his direction is fast and unrelentless    he never slows down his pace   which makes for a wild ride    writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein    the writing is usually very funny   and sometimes very corny    the dialogue is smart but not too smart    we aren t required to know everything   but some plot holes are left unanswered    thankfully we are not intended to notice   and we really don t   except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while      amazingly   with all the wars and romance going on   the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues    in fact   these governmental changes seem fairly plausible   and this adds another layer to the story    the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre   but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage    i haven t laughed this loud   even in some comedies    oh   and the special effects are first rate    starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci fi violence and gore   and for some language and nudity    believe me when i say this   don t take young kids to see this film    it is extremely violent    in fact   it is probably the most violent film out this year    however   if you are old enough   over 17   to see it   starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain    it s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros   while also cheering for the bad guys    and still   it is my dream to see a sci fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind   and take over the world    now that would be entertaining !  
Pos, one of the last entries in the long running carry on series   carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a  caravan  site    professors anna vrooshka   elke sommer   and roland crump   kenneth williams   and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep   kenneth connor   so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains    anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick     for instance   when anna is asking for  scrubbers for dirty caravan    she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan !  arthur upmore   bernard bresslaw   and his wife linda   patsy rowlands   take her mother daphne barnes   joan sims   and her minah bird on holiday with them    mother in law jokes prevail    furthermore   the trouble that joe and norma baxter   ian lavender and adrienne posta   have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families    fred ramsden   windsor davies   and ernie bragg   jack douglas   leave their wives   liz fraser and patricia franklin   behind for a fishing holiday    however   they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls   sandra   carol hawkins   and carol   sherrie hewson      the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day to day running of the camp   the search for the minah bid and greyhound   the major   fred and ernie s desperate need of a woman   a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park s pub   and a shock in store for daphne    the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing    this is what binds the movie together    joan sims stands out as the demanding mother in law   bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife   and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast    on the other hand   there are low key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman   and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen !  even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman   there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors    although the regular cast is depleted   the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film    a relative flop at the cinema   this movie deserves a lot more recognition    
Pos, slavery is bad    after hundreds of years   we ve finally figured that one out    this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg s latest   serious   film    during the late 1830s   a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa s west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery    fifty three of them are stuffed into the   la amistad     from a spanish word for   friendship     by their new spanish owners    freeing himself from his chains   senge pieh   djimon hounsou     renamed cinque by his masters   leads a bloody revolt    after killing most of the crew   the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home   or so they think    instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states    the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy    the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property    if they are property   who do they belong to    their masters    the spanish government    salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship    the us government    the defendants are pawns in several games    abolitionists theodore joadson   morgan freeman   and lewis tappan   stellan skarsgard   want to free them   but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause    their lawyer roger baldwin   matthew mcconaughey   views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees    south carolina senator john c   calhoun   arliss howard   pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states    president martin van buren   nigel hawthorne   is willing to force the result towards his own political ends    when the verdict looks to free the africans   van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes    even that doesn t work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims    at the urging of calhoun   the president then appeals the case to the supreme court   populated by a majority of slave owners    this little known   try finding it in any history text book   incident from america s past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams   anthony hopkins   who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court    the slavery issue is easy pickin s for spielberg    much like his   shindler s list     which followed   jurassic park   as this follows   lost world       the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose    nazis and slave traders   both treat groups of others as less than human    it s not hard to see who the bad guys are    without that question to ponder   the director s job is more difficult    he has to make the story interesting    spielberg succeeds for the most part    the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach    where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle    there are very few  people  in the tale    in fact   cinque is the only character who is fleshed out    tappan and joadson are   abolitionists     symbols but not humans    van buren is a weak politician but nothing else    the rest of the   slaves   barely exist other than dressing for the set    like many other films about people of color   almost all the major players are white    the film s salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou    the former model s first major role is a winner    without speaking more than five words of english   he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog    the other stand out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents   he also played the title role in   nixon        the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court room drama ever on the screen    there are some other great moments    especially impressive are the african s struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land    their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant    as grand as the epic is   it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans    more humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four star film       michael redman has written this column for a real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some 1998 films      
Pos, synopsis   bobby garfield   yelchin   lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother   hope davis      bobby s world revolves around his friends   especially the spritely carol   boorem      then one day   a new boarder arrives at bobby s house    ted brautigan   hopkins   is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking    as the bond between bobby and ted deepens   bobby becomes privy to ted s great secret   an event which will change both of their lives forever    review   a small but enchanting movie     hearts in atlantis   easily recalls another king inspired coming of age film     stand by me     both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys       hearts   is a tribute to the magic of childhood   to those summers when the days seem neverending   and nothing means more than your closest friends    unlike   stand by me     there is a supernatural element to   hearts     but although it is key to the plot   it is not prominent    like   stand by me     this is a mostly character driven film   and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting    yelchin is very good as bobby   finding a good mix of innocence and resignation    more splendid still is boorem   whom i praised highly for her work in   along came a spider   and who is simply radiant here as carol    and then there is hopkins   who despite playing such a quiet   introspective character as ted   nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen    less successful is davis   whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish    i also found it odd that bobby and carol s other friend   sully   whose death as an adult sets up the movie s flashback framing device     is paid virtually no attention    but hicks  direction is lovely without being cloying   and despite the movie s general lack of incident   it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience    
Pos, titantic   writer and director james cameron s much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200   000   000 epic   arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises   whether the film is worth it    as a business proposition   it seems hard to see how it can ever break even   but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful    if you ve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure   think again    the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world s most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers    in either case   it is filmmaking at its best    when we entered the press screening   my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long    he said no but that the time would go by so fast she d never notice the length    amazingly   he was right    titanic is one of the few long films that doesn t suffer because of it    the lush picture   filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm   opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean    fortune hunter brock lovett   bill paxton   leads the expedition looking for the world s most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship   known back then as   the ship of dreams      the necklace s hundred year old former owner   rose dewitt bukater   gloria stuart     finds brock to tell him her story    although almost all of the movie happens in flashback   one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk    using a computer simulation   the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later   which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing    after twenty minutes   the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage    in a classic movie theme   the two parts of the ship   first class and steerage   third class   exist in sharp contrast    the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing    entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance   cal hockley   played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane    and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand   an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class    even with her own promenade deck   rose feels trapped on the ship   what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes    in contrast   jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board    after jack saves rose from committing suicide   they start a brief but impassioned love affair    never tawdry and rarely explicit   their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story    leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma    in so many ways   small and large   he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part    when he confronts cal   for example   he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal s supercilious put downs    kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose    the chemistry between these two academy award nominees   him for what s eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility   is nothing short of astonishing    from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship s bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude   they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances    if the film breaks after an hour and a half   which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up   you will still get one of the best films of the year    peter lamont s sets are more than authentic    one scene   for example   starts with the planning to retire captain   played with insouciance by bernard hill   having his tea on deck    it then shifts to the ship s massive gears and then to the bright hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals    the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner    easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest    at first   since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull   not some big gaping hole   the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else    what a lark    we ve struck an iceberg    now let s get back to our brandy and cigars    the ship s musicians play like troopers through it all   even after the panic sets in    after all   they see it as their duty to calm the passengers    when the musicians are about to die   they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together   and they mean it    their civility borders on insanity   but it is touching nevertheless    the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface    there are more than enough characters to love and to hate   and all of the casting is dead on    special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable    in titanic   for which he created a nine tenths scale model of the entire ship   cameron strove for accuracy at all costs    the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two   and the front section becomes vertical in the water    people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately    besides being romantic and dramatic   the script includes liberal doses of humor    from the many deliciously subtle verbal put downs to the physical comedy   as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man   the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears       it s good bye for a little while     a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first       this boat s for mommies and children    there ll be a boat in a little while for daddies      basically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats    it made the decks look too crowded otherwise    perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim s on board the ship    in the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink   he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew       no thanks     the elegantly attired guggenheim replies       we re dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen    but we would like a brandy      titanic runs 3   14    it is rated pg 13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up    
Pos, truman     true man     burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey s character in this film    president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide   in spite of   or was it because of   his stature       truman   also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war   an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans    and burbank   california   brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc    if hollywood is the center of the film world   burbank is   or was   the center of tv s world   the world where our protagonist lives    combine all these names and concepts into   truman burbank     and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world    truman leads the perfect life    his town   his car   and his wife are picture perfect    his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky    the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart            but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light    the next day during the drive to work   the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements    he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian    when the radio comes back to normal   the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully    his suspicion aroused   he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities    the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator    the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks    a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door   made to look like the back of an elevator   into place    two security guards grab him and throw him out    truman is really suspicious now    it gets even worse the next day when his wife   a nurse   describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge       it s best not to think about it     she says   trying vainly to change truman s memory    truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense    at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town    his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world    you know by now that truman s life is the subject of a television program    his actions are   real   but everything else is carefully scripted   from the death of his father to the choice of his wife    truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is    meanwhile   christof   the all seeing creator of truman s world does his best to keep him unaware and happy    it s sort of like westworld told from the robots  point of view   or jurassic park from the dinosaurs  point of view    we root for the captive of the cage world    our protagonist is counting on   chaos theory   to help him escape his elaborate trap    the story   written by andrew niccol   writer/director of gattaca     introduces some interesting questions   such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life   or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake    although these questions came to mind   i don t think the film itself asked them    it certainly didn t address them or try to answer them    i was particularly disappointed that the film didn t deal more with the trauma of learning one s life is a tv show    carrey s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman s pain   but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film s pacing    earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well    the two seemed exclusive of one another   but weir and niccol didn t see it that way    perhaps it s not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn t   but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here    but on its own terms   the movie is well made    sight   sound and pacing are all handled competently    much of the first part of the movie is the truman show    the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras   with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen    one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio   the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen    the music is well chosen and scored    the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music   when truman s world is still beautiful and perfect    when the movie ends   the score sounds more like a frantic   driven   tangerine dream opus   while still keeping the same timbre    philip glass  epic music   from powaqqatsi   permeates truman s scenes of suspicion and awakening       glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show      and the pacing of the story was brisk    there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show   just a few quick title cards   a few interviews   and then right into the show   and the movie    one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling   there was no token scene of truman s idyllic life before it falls apart   because it wasn t necessary   we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble   and no sooner    there s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down    it s a quick   straight shot to the movie s end    in terms of overall quality   i would compare the truman show to niccol s gattaca    both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds    but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas   neither film   clicked   and became an instant classic    nevertheless   i look forward to niccol s next film   whatever it may be    
Neg, we could paraphrase michelle pfieffer s character in dangerous minds and say that beyond rangoon starts with an   a      that s fair enough    all movies   like all school children   should be given the benefit of the doubt    the chance to succeed    after all   we like to think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders    mountains can be moved   and good movies can be made    yeah right    children fail   as do films    as does director john boorman s latest    the success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette   ed wood   true romance   as the busty westerner in peril wandering about 1988 burma without a passport    though we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there   it s a tougher task to overlook the actress    she s a lightweight    as the first scene   with narration !    demonstrates   she doesn t have * nearly * enough range for the emotions that her character  a mother fleeing the memories of a murdered husband and son  is supposed to show    she may give a stronger performance than   say   keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds   by not by much    beyond rangoon is a very physically appealing film   thanks to the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman   deliverance   excalibur   hope and glory      he keeps the narrative moving   no matter how muddy the story  or the heroine  gets    why he chose arquette remains a mystery   though    maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies    but even after an hour of half stated political statements and murky mass killings   we * still * don t know enough of what s happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations    empty exoticism    the technical credits in beyond rangoon are a curious mix   combining lush jungle photography with bad blue screen work    also odd is the obvious dubbing    done to make some of the foreign characters sound less foreign    and   is it my mistake   or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers      doo doo doo doo    [   twilight zone   theme   or opinion of movie    you be the judge   ]  
Neg, when i originally saw the trailer for   analyze this   a few months ago   i must admit   i thought it looked kind of lame    and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago   i thought it looked outright bad    but then when   analyze this   finally opened a few days ago   an odd thing happened    it got great reviews    critics were proclaiming it   hilarious   and a   dead on parody of mob movies      well   with praise like that   i figured   it must be good and so i headed off to the theater    you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts    well   turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for       analyze this   is slow   unfunny   and badly acted    don t get me wrong   i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century   but he is just out of his league here    i think the problem is he didn t quite know how to approach this material    he plays his character   mob boss paull vitti   somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama    if he had played the character straight   along the lines of leslie nielson in the   naked gun   series   he probably would have been a lot more successful    as it is   though   he plays the character completely serious at some moments   and for laughs at others    this doesn t work    it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold   you always know it s him    and the movie is badly paced   too    it never takes off    it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum    i think the blame for this should be placed on the script    it s obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie   mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist   but once this is established   the movie doesn t really go anywhere    the formula of the film seems to be this   billy crystal says no to deniro   deniro forces him   and much wackiness ensues    this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie    i ve said it before and i ll say it again   the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it s funny    if   analyze this   had been funny   the pacing and bad acting wouldn t have bothered me    i would have been too busy laughing to notice    but as it is   i only chuckled a few times    the only really funny scene is a dead on parody of   the godfather      sadly   though   i don t think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody   because i was the only one laughing    but my sense of humour   i have come to realize   is vastly different from the general population    i loathed   there s something about mary     yet loved   baseketball      now   if you want a movie that * i * think is funny   go out and see   office space      it s full of genuine laughs and won t leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes   as   analyze this   did    
Pos, while watching   shallow grave     i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens    blood simple      both are good films in which several characters   none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil   indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes    the body count rises   and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands    both films are also flawed   but for different reasons       blood simple   is unrelentingly dark and moody   but its characterizations were a little hollow       shallow grave     on the other hand   is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes   and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they d accomplished for a more standard   audience pleasing ending    the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time   yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end    as the film begins   we are introduced to alex   ewan mcgregor     juliet   kerry fox     and david   christopher eccleston     a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow    they are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious   but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch    a man named hugo moves into the apartment s remaining vacancy   and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose    juliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash   presumably from criminal activities      the three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death   after a drawing of straws   the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david   who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning    all of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film   and part of what makes   shallow grave   so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next    other than the obvious question of why they don t report the death and simply hide the cash   which is not addressed   the plotting and characterization   while sometimes predictable   worked in a way that kept my attention and   on more than one occasion   gave me chills    i will   therefore   attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn t give away too much of the plot    broadly   the trio are in danger due to hugo s underworld connections   as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process    a police inspector   ken stott   is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment   asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective    david   meanwhile   becomes increasingly paranoid   moves into the attic   and develops an affinity for sharp objects    director danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment   and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other    while i do not consider myself the   happy endings are automatically stupid   type   i thought that   shallow grave   really should have ended in tragedy   a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison   in the mental hospital   or in the morgue    this could have been accomplished   quite credibly   but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional   caper   ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom   and nothing more    granted   this isn t really a   happy   ending   but it s still pretty light hearted compared to what preceded it    i really shouldn t say anything more about the ending as far as details go   but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable    yes   this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes   but ultimately it left me feeling as if i d been cheated    still     shallow grave   was brilliant most of the way through   and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller   and i am therefore awarding it three stars    i guess i just can t help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away    
Neg,    holy man   boasts a sweet   gentle   comic performance from an unusually subdued eddie murphy and a few moderately funny skits    unfortunately   to get to the good stuff you have to sit through a painfully long set up   loads of tedious filler   interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering and twitching   a superfluous romantic subplot and quite possibly the most annoying performance of robert loggia s career    if ever a movie screamed   wait for video so you can fast forward through all the dull and annoying parts     this is it    eddie murphy plays g   a robed nomadic pilgrim wandering the land enjoying the moment and spreading his spiritual message    a chance meeting with ricky hayman   goldblum     a stressed out executive of a home shopping channel   and kate newell   kelly preston     a no nonsense media analyst   results in physical injury to g   quicker than you can say   the odd couple     g ends up rooming with an extremely leery ricky    after some script gymnastics   g appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network   wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations   enraging network owner mr   mcbainbridge   loggia     and becoming a national media sensation       holy man   attempts to be several things at once    it tries to satirize home shopping networks   but it s difficult to effectively make fun of something that is already a self parody    the film attempts to teach us that collecting material possessions is merely a futile attempt to fill the spiritual holes in our hearts   but that s common knowledge already       holy man   also tries to present a story of redemption   as ricky hayman tries to decide whether to exploit g s good will to achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his career    anyone want to place a wager on his final decision    the one genuine asset in   holy man   is eddie murphy   who gives a charming performance   sharing love   good will and relevant advice to all those around him   while beaming his million dollar smile at just the right moments    murphy is delightful and the film takes off whenever he s onscreen    unfortunately   he s not onscreen enough    jeff goldblum gets the lion s share of screen time and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down    as his potential love interest   kelly preston tries to brighten things up   but she transforms from an all business media shark to an empathic softy far too quickly and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance    the other principal actor   robert loggia   wastes his talents in a one note turn as a ruthless   screaming monster    structurally unsound and way too long     holy man   is appealing when murphy is onscreen and dull when he isn t    instead of dropping your money at the theater for this trifle   wait until it hits video and fast forward past everything except the murphy scenes    g suggests that we focus on enjoying the moment and that s the best way to do so    
Pos,    the blair witch project   was perhaps one of a kind   a unique film that played completely on its own merit   managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses    its success made a sequel inevitable   but this is not the sequel   i suspect   anyone much wanted    after the release of   the blair witch project     tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville   in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch    locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity   selling twig sculptures   stones and dirt like those in the movie   and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn   shouting     get out of these woods and go home !  there is no goddamned blair witch !      jeff     is one of those people   who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage    after he got released from the mental institution   he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet    as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods   on the   blair witch hunt      among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend   the pregnant tristen   who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called   the blair witch   history or hysteria       and kim   who dresses in black and has some psychic powers    the last member of the crew is erica   a young beautiful witch wannabe   who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore   saying   the first rule of wicca is   do no harm   because whatever you do will come back to you threefold      this strange group plunges into the woods   where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience    on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr s abandoned house   strange things start happening    when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain    after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies    they are somehow lost in time   as it loops uncontrollably back and forth    they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality    the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods      documentary director joe berlinger     paradice lost     helms   blair witch 2     leaving the creators of the first film   dan myrick and ed sanches   in the background    the opening scenes  the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film   is a more promising approach   because instead of trying to cover similar ground   it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand    but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story   that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue    in a way   this is a typical hollywood sequel    more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail    the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated    of course in these situations   quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values    from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody red forest   with carter burwell s     being john malkovich   and   fargo     musical score in the background   you realize that with the exception of its title   this film has absolutely nothing to do with   the blair witch project         blair witch        was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation    in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection   creating a completely different atmosphere    with its graceful cinematography   production design and flashy editing   the film has a very polished look   which is impossible to associate with the first installment    and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times   he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor    the key is simplicity       blair witch project   had a story which was incredibly simple    that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination    the film was practically an empty screen   on which we projected our most frightening nightmares    the effect was incredibly powerful   lasting and entir e everyone   but in a different way       book of shadows   feels incredibly controlled and restrict    here   very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and   clever   that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it    there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with    this is simply a less artistic film that doesn t have the talent and originality of its predecessor    it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn t always succeed    but most importantly   it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie   which doesn t allow it to destroy the original    in the end   i can t call it a bad effort    it s less artistic   not so scary and less original   but certainly not bad    it s simply different    in fact   if you haven t seen   the blair witch project     you might like this film for what it is    a cross between   the blair witch project   and the   scream    films    the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting   jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned   and incredible sense of surrealism    but it s a common knowledge and experience that   with a few exceptions   every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making    to me the story of   the blair witch project   seemed completed   but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that   the book of shadows   is certainly assured    and it s already time to look forward to   blair witch 3      
Neg,    the red violin   is a cold   sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached    it s a movie that seems almost clinical   as it traces the 300 plus years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title    opening in the 17th century   the story shows how violin maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son    but when tragedy strikes   the violin becomes the personification of its maker s grief    from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery    again   tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph    we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in mao s communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz   samuel l   jackson     who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity    the violin becomes morritz s obsession   just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it    morritz   however   is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creator s intention       the red violin   could have been a touching   inspirational story   as soaring as a beethoven symphony    however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer    here is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact    girard   for some unknown reason   uses mostly master shots   keeping his camera   and thus us   at a distance    we get no feel for the miracle that is the violin    it s resonance   its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression    nor are any of the performances memorable    it s as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin       the red violin   promises much   but delivers little    it is dull at times   a bit pretentious and a might murky    the movie s music soars over its story and performers    and that is its only saving grace    
Pos,    very bad things     is the most delightfully morbid film of the year   a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn t help but be won over by the material    the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas    the groom to be is kyle fisher   jon favreau     who is about to be married to the controlling   wedding obsessed laura   cameron diaz      the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd   christian slater     quiet charles   leland orser     and brothers   michael   jeremy piven   and family man adam   daniel stern      after a wild night of gambling   boozing   and drugs   a stripper   carla scott   who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room   but after a freak accident   to everyone s terror   she is killed    as robert puts it     there are two options   go to the police and go to prison   or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her      after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body   robert is forced to kill him as well       okay   there is only one option now    you can forget about calling the police     he says    by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer   most of them are overcome with guilt   which sets off an even more elaborate series of event   that includes much   much more murder   double crosses   and the inevitable wedding from hell       very bad things     which is actor peter berg s feature film directing debut   is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that     there s something about mary     wanted to be    it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh   original   and hilarious   even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence   gore   and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end    the screenplay   also written by berg   is   to put it mildly   very funny and courageous    during the second act of the film   some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death   which was beginning to undermine the humor   but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed    the dialogue is edgy and inventive   and this film proves that a movie doesn t necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable    there s more fun   i think   in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts    cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here   and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura   who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends    diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january    by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger   and reciting lines like     stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs     i couldn t help but crack up at how   balls to the wall   this film had become    jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original   as daniel stern s wife   who late in the picture   we discover   is a tough kick boxer that should not be messed around with    it is at this level that     very bad things     was so entertaining and surprising    just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen   there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky    the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over the top    although i enjoyed the film immensely   let me make this clear     very bad things     is not a movie for everyone    it is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen   it is more violent and bloody than a r rated film usually is   and it is offensive    luckily   these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy   since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no holds barred   politically incorrect comedy    the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and   safe   wide releases coming out lately   still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry    
Neg,  * * the following review contains spoilers * *     please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie         chuck dowling   the jacksonville film journal  i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997 s batman and robin    apparently   no one heard my words    oh   how i wish you had heard them    oh how i wish someone had stopped him        because he s done it again    the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore   a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale    in fact   it was everything that 8mm is not    in the opening minutes of 8mm   we see private detective tom welles   nicolas cage   working on a case for a prestigious member of the u   s   government    keep this fact in mind   cage is trusted with an important case   which he solves    he returns home to his wife and new daughter   and even finds time to rake his yard   keep that in mind too   it s important as well      he s hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery    after her husband s death she comes across a film in his private safe    it appears to be snuff film   a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera    the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film   hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film    so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film    the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless    welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman s lawyer   anthony heald   an actor who always plays the same type of character   that being a bad guy      when you first see him   your first instinct is that he s behind the whole thing    the choice of casting does the film in    then   as welles begins his investigation   at times we will see a shadowy figure following him    the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer   or someone sent by the lawyer   because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet    so your first instinct has now been confirmed    then   when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing   he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced   in one of those ridiculous   since we re going to kill you anyway   why not tell you the whole thing   moments      but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he s told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended    huh    also   when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing   his main goal is to get the film back    so why did he give it up in the first place   !  the lawyer had the film the whole time   then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film   !  it s totally absurd        and this is the screenwriter of seven    late in the film there s a confrontation between all the main characters   and after a struggle one of the character s guns ends up underneath a car    cage   who has been handcuffed to a bed   is rapidly trying to get to his gun   which is on a table    james gandolfini s character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of   suspense      you see   the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he s trying to reach it from   and so instead of going around the car to the other side   where he can easily reach it   he just keeps stretching    go around to the other side of the car ! !  this goes on for minutes    then   after cage gets his gun   gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car    boy   schumacher is really really getting on my nerves    i think the final straw would be when cage returns home   devastated by everything that he s seen on this case   and then is no longer able to rake his lawn !  we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard    other things that bugged me about 8mm   one would be the music   if you can call it that    whenever the score starts up   it sounds like techno music   and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it    awful decision there joel    another is cage s performance    at this point he s capable of a wide range of performances   either good or bad    for 8mm   he delivers a very wooden one   and only shines when he s interacting with joaquin phoenix   who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case      you re capable of much better mr   cage    now as for you mr   schumacher        i m starting to doubt if you re capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema    [r]  
Neg, a couple of criminals   mario van peebles and loretta devine   move into a rich family s house in hopes of conning them out of their jewels    however   someone else steals the jewels before they are able to get to them    writer mario van peebles delivers a clever script with several unexpected plot twists   but director mario van peebles undermines his own high points with haphazard camera work   editing and pacing    it felt as though the film should have been wrapping up at the hour mark   but alas there was still 35 more minutes to go    daniel baldwin   i can t believe i m about to type this   gives the best performance in the film   outshining the other talented members of the cast    [r]  
Pos, after a stylistic detour with mrs    parker and the vicious circle   which   despite its uncomfortable tone   was close to being a conventional movie     director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow   a romantic black comedy about love   betrayal   and self absorption    while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture   rudolph s atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing   if not always pleasant   movie    it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director   meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it    until mrs    parker   i had not been overly impressed by his movies    i found equinox   his last pre  mrs    parker effort   to be irritating and frustrating    i was somewhat surprised   therefore   to discover that i liked afterglow    there are several reasons for this   but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident   mannered aspects of his approach    the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems   the story is absorbing   and the acting is top notch    in short   rudolph has created a world that it s worth spending two hours in    afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples    jeffrey byron   jonny lee miller   is a cold   seemingly heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife   marianne   lara flynn boyle      for her part   marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level    all she s interested in is seducing him during those few days when she s ovulating    after he refuses to make love   she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor    the other couple   lucky   nick nolte   and phyllis mann   julie christie     are an older pair   but they re no more content than jeffrey and marianne    a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart    they remain married as a matter of convenience   but   since phyllis won t allow lucky to touch her   they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs    the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable    the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey    the two of them are immediately attracted to one another   and it doesn t take long before they re lounging together   naked   in her pool    meanwhile   jeffrey   who is captivated by older women   runs into phyllis in a hotel bar   is smitten   and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains    the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love    sex means something different to everyone   to jeffrey   it s an unpleasant chore   a loss of control   to marianne   it s a means to a maternal end   to lucky   it s an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles   and to phyllis   it s a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness    ultimately   none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves    the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script   but in the performances    jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish   callous   suit and tie businessman    those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity    lara flynn boyle   who wasn t impressive in rudolph s equinox   is greatly improved   making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability    nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky   and he manages to deliver some of rudolph s most pregnant lines with practiced ease    the clear standout   however   is julie christie   who is nothing short of delicious as the world weary phyllis    her often wry   occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film s humor   and there s hardly ever a moment when she doesn t steal the spotlight from her co stars    i don t know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph  detractors   but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director s earlier productions    enough of his trademark style remains   however   to reassure his supporters    afterglow is basically a four pronged character study    the plot is not especially compelling   but the character interaction is   and that s the real reason to see this motion picture    rudolph has painted an able picture of the non romantic side of love    the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction    
Neg, an attempt at florida film noir   palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels    it s slow moving   uninvolving   and plain just uninteresting    harry barber   woody harrelson   is an ex newspaper man   just out of jail after being framed for a crime    his luck hasn t been the best   but things are looking up when a mysterious woman   rhea malroux   elisabeth shue     approaches him with a proposition    she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter   odette   chloe sevigny     pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get $500   000 out of her stingy   but rich   husband felix   rolf hoppe      at first   all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone   and to collect the money   of which he gets to keep 10%      but   as the deed is carried out   things are not what they seem   and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm    palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film   but the effect never quite comes together    it s got the sultry florida heat   seductive women   and even curvier plot twists   but the whole thing smells of paint by numbers    sure   the right ingredients are there   but the end result is much too artificial    a lot of the problems lie with the script   which   though providing some genuine surprises   is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations    even the plot twists don t seem to flow well with the rest of the story    some of them   for example   come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist   for example   harry s spontaneous job offer   or the whole typewriter situation      the characters are mostly lifeless   played to type   but not much more    woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick headedness that it s hard to even picture him as an ex journalist    elisabeth shue vamps it up   but doesn t add anything special to the role    chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance   trying to be a sexy 17 year old   but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth    some of the supporting cast   notably gina gershon and michael rapaport   give stronger   but   in the end   meaningless performances    and to top it off   the pacing of the film is much too slow    as the movie grinds to a halt   you re given too much time to wonder why you re wasting it watching palmetto    if you re in the mood for this type of movie   you d be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir    
Neg, call   hush     stop or my mom will kill      or   mommy fearest      or   the hand that robs the cradle      call it whatever you want   but certainly don t see it unless you re in desperate need of a bad movie induced chuckle      hush   scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure    chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post production tinkering   it was supposed to open about a year ago     the latter of which appears to have given   hush   a send off that s downright infuriating    it s too bad that   hush   is so laughable   because the on screen talent    including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange    is nothing to laugh at    paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson   a photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy   well to do family s horse farm/estate kilronan    jackson s mother martha   lange   runs kilronan all by herself   and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately    even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether   caught red handed after a bedroom romp with her husband to be    but it seems that martha s friendly smile masks a much more threatening demeanor   she s what you d call someone who loves too much    martha eagerly   deviously wants a grandchild   and then helen will be expendable   as far as she s concerned    if there s one reason to catch   hush     it s lange    she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated   injecting martha   poorly written though she may be   with a little empathy to level out the psycho playing field    when she delves into martha s dark side   predictable cliches    chain smoking   staring in mirrors   praying in a confessional to a priest who isn t there   poking a hole in helen s diaphragm so she ll become pregnant   and she does      abound   but it s moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch    veteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jackson s wheelchair bound paternal grandmother    the rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable   especially paltrow    but can you really blame them    the character relationships in   hush   hold a certain amount of promise   at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity    idiotic situations   martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over   compliment idiotic dialogue     why did you yell      helen yells back at martha     and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank from hell flicks ever made    you can see through a great deal of martha s actions and lies from their conception   why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out    does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town    if any of her potential victims thought   acted or behaved like normal people     hush   would be a really short movie    and then there s the climax and ending   which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a labor inducing drug normally used on horses    after a really weird chase scene   martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself    i won t spoil what happens next except to say that it s contradictory   illogical and   probably   since i m no doctor   medically impossible    the final scene offers no closure   no resolution   no confrontation whatsoever    it s just there   dangling amidst silent displeasure    no one should like this ending   regardless of their feelings on the preceding material    perhaps   hush    s title is a plea to silence its audience s likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater    
Pos, director jan de bont certainly knows how to make top quality action films    you need look no further than die hard   he was director of photography     speed and last years twister for examples of his hi  octane   edge of your seat thrill prowess    speed 2 is no exception    this time   the action takes place on a huge cruise liner   on which sandra bullock and jason patrick are trying to develop their relationship    yep   that s right   no keanu reeves this time   but fear not   jason patrick is more than up to the job    speaking of which   the job at hand is to stop completely bonkers terrorist   willem dafoe   from crashing the liner into a huge island   after stealing a diamond collection    the reason for this act of destruction is revenge    after years of working for the company that builds cruise liner computers   he contracts copper poisoning and is retired    naturally   what entails next is a lot of running/jumping about and general high quality action as jason patrick does his level best to save the day    thinking back on this film   you can t help   but admire it s structure    the way   willem dafoe initiates his plan and throws red herrings to the crew and passengers    the race against time to save the liner from crashing   and of course   the finale chase scence       although this is ruined by an over the top   one too many stunt and explosion      simple in construction   effective in it s execution   and the result   a clear and concise   highly enjoyable action film    the acting is adequate   although it s darned obvious that sandra bullock is only in it to create a  hot totty  appeal to the men   and she does that perfectly !     jason patrick fills the action hero role superbly and willem dafoe is just great as the crazed terrorist    overall   speed 2 is a most enjoyable thrill ride    not up to it s predecessor s high calibre but very good all the same    there is plenty going on   some of the thrills are quite tense and it also proves that you do not need blood and guts to make a good action movie    
Neg, five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king s writings called the shawshank redemption   9/10     writer/director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king    unlike the latter film   this one is a big   long   laborious bore    plot   a seven foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers    critique   this film is slow   drawn out   boring   uninteresting   unexciting   predictable and topped with a couple of one dimensional   evil   characters    its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles    the real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward   unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about    of course   much like all other death row cell blocks   this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be   misunderstood     except for one cookie cutter crazy guy who is evil personified    and let s not forget all the guards on death row   who also happen to be angels from the heaven above   except for one cookie cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified   and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates            am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film    or even more importantly   am i supposed to give a rat s ass about anyone in this film    well   if i was   i sure missed that boat   because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin    furthermore   there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone s life to present this story    in fact   the story is empty within itself    i truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal   and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not    wow    how interesting    the plot s utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film   we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie      whip out those thinking caps   kids !  hmmm   and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie cutter   evil   guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity    hmmmm   now think hard here   boys and girls    what a crock !  i am guessing that this film was supposed to be some three hour exercise in spirituality   but unfortunately for me   it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging    in fact   it was one big bore    i didn t see the point of the movie   i didn t see the point of the story and i certainly didn t see the point in tom hanks  big double chin    all in all   a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work   especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour   john coffey    give that man an award or something !  
Pos, for many people   procrastination isn t a problem to overcome   it s a high art    we ll do just about anything to put off a task    when the deadline for this column nears   it s the only time during the week dishes get washed and the bed made and laundry done and plants watered and        eventually   hopefully   sometimes   there s a breakthrough and we actually get down to work    amazingly it s almost always easier than we dreaded and after finishing   that sense of oppressive apprehension melts away    and then   the next time   we do it all again    english professor grady tripp   michael douglas   is a master    seven years ago   his first book was a hit    he s been working on his second    a short 200 page piece    since then    fearful that he can t live up to the first   he can t bring himself to finish it    no writer s block   he s nearing 3   000 pages with no end in sight    now he s having a particularly difficult day    the college s annual writers conference is bringing in accomplished novelists reminding tripp that other people are finishing  their  books    during the first day   his wife has left him   his married girlfriend informs him she s pregnant and his agent is in town with a six foot transvestite in tow    by the evening   our besieged writer is driving though the snow covered streets of pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him   a stolen jacket that marilyn monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat and a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk    this could be a pivotal point in his mid life crisis    and then there s the next morning    there s a lot to like about this movie    there are no huge explosions   shattering glass or computer generated dinosaurs to distract from the very real human issues    grady is caught up in the curse of people who accomplish great things early in their career    in the world of   what have you done for me lately       he knows his second book has to be better than his first    instead of finding out   he drifts   comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood    he doesn t have much of a life and neither does his star pupil james leer   tobey maguire      james may be suicidal and psychotic    certainly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie    he makes up a past of working clash anguish because the truth of wealth and comfort just isn t interesting enough    as the weekend progresses   they are both forced to fully engage life    that s the question they must face   comfort or real experiences    the film takes some interesting chances    non traditional relationships are presented as matter of fact    extra marital   gay   interracial   professor student   here they aren t judged   merely choices    the actors are all first rate    douglas triumphs   playing against type as he spends most of his time disheveled   unshaven and clad in a pink women s house robe    maguire s disengaged alienation works perfectly here    robert downey jr   as grady s agent livens up his scenes    director curtis hanson     l   a    confidential     makes a few missteps    the women are underused    frances mcdormand does a good job of her limited role of sara   grady s married lover but we never understand much of who she is    the chemistry between the two of them is non existent which makes some of the ending unconvincing    katie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor   but her character goes nowhere    we never even see grady s exiting wife    this is very much a guy s film    the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others    grady s alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film   not him and sara    as the boomers age   expect to see more mid life crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic    eventually it ll probably become cliche   but right now we ve got a winner    i ll finish this in a second    right now i have to grab some paint    i noticed some trim in the other room that needs a little touch up       michael redman has written this column for so long that he s made mid life crisis a career choice      
Neg, i m not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick   because i m not sure just what the hell   pardon the expression   was going on in it    however   i can express the most important observation i made of it   i   e    i didn t like it    if i had to summarize this film   i think i d conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal    that s the kernel of it   anyway    tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women   feminism   the role of the devil   modern reformers   and friendship    unfortunately   little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts   they re simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace    actually   i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was    they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy   on the level of ghostbusters   and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones    they laughed   or tried to laugh   at moments that were either barely funny   or much more horrible than funny   as if that could bend the film away from it s rather frightening direction    three women   cher   susan sarandon   and michelle pfieffer   live in eastwick   a small midwestern town    one night   while drinking late into the evening   they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives    in seeming answer to their idle daydreams   a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be    he soon shows evidence of mystical  perhaps demonic  power   and his devotion to the women s merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones    even worse   when ignored his moods become ugly   and he mistreats the women for spurning him    anyway   the problems   all three female characters are fairly uninteresting   and several are cardboard stereotypes   especially sarandon s character    we never get inside them   never feel sympathetic to them   because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland    as for nicholson   well   even the devil needs a direction to go in   and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie   due to the grace of the screenwriter and   more importantly   nicholson s acting     he still can t be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague    and then there s the special effects    not in themselves  they weren t that good  but their overuse    i was almost positive   until i saw the credits   that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind   who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl     because of the big name actors in dopy stunts   or stephen spielberg   after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholson blown down the street stunt    nope   it s another bunch of guys   and directed by george miller   who has shown great skill with stunts/special effects before   the road warrior     nightmare at 20   00 feet   episode of twilight zone   the movie   but apparently doesn t know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act    f gawds sake   guys   this is jack nicholson !  let him loose !  let him grin demonically !  skip the splitting earth and fake lightning !  watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll   all i could think of was     what a waste      if you re going to use slapstick like that   use it up on pee wee herman    nicholson does what he can with the role   and when he can find his bearings   can be extremely good   the scene in the church   for instance     but most of the time   he seems a bit stiff   as if he s not sure what he should be doing next    and no wonder    this script goes all over the map   giving you the feeling that it d just love to be allegory   but it s not sure about what   maybe if you give it time it ll think of something    so what is the witches of eastwick    a horror movie    a folk tale    a comedy    a statement about women    an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality    i tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me       watching  someone regurgitate half digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms   people   the screen   and ultimately   the audience    in other words   a mess       $2   00    if you like nicholson enough to watch him here   maybe 25% of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others    
Neg, i went to blair witch project 2   book of shadows with the highest of hopes    the original film   released last summer   was genuinely scary and terrifying   i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor    unfortunately   my hopes were soon dashed    as the movie opens   the audience is shown pseudo documentary clips of burkittsville   maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie    it s a mostly humorous   self aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film    during this segment   we are introduced to the protagonist   a young man who sells blair witch related memorabilia from his website    the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously    we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia   but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies    we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette smoking doctor luridly leers above him    we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room   we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him    no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution   in fact   these scenes are barely referred to again    i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes   generally   a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting   filthy interiors   and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie    the movie cuts again   this time to the present    the young man   whose name is jeffrey   played by jeffrey donovan    as in the first movie   the character names are identical to the actors  names   although this movie admits up front that it is fictional   so there s no reason for the practice this time around     is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the   blair witch hunt     which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website    we meet tristen and steven   a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience    steven is a skeptic   believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria    tristen   on the other hand   believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence    she is wan and soft spoken   she complains that the radio is playing too loudly       she also complains that she feels nauseated   i knew immediately that the character was pregnant   and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out    how did i know    because in bad movies   nauseated women are always pregnant      the fourth member of their party is erica   a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch   not evil    they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery    kim is dressed completely in black   has extreme goth style makeup on   and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities   but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch    presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect   it s never explained    the party of five heads off into the woods as promised    they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr s house and set up camp   complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night s events    there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well   but after a few words are exchanged   the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere    the movie veers off at this point to spend many long   long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down    sexual innuendoes are tossed around   much hard liquor   beer   and pot is consumed   and nothing much else happens    this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary    the next day   the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed   and that steven and tristen s manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds   like snow    the videotapes are missing   but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim   they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house     right where the original blair witch tapes were found !    ooh    spooky    the team goes back to jeffrey s house    a creepy old civil war era warehouse in the heart of the woods    to regroup and review the tapes    they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night    wacky hijinks ensue    tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch   everybody starts finding these weird rune like burn marks on their bodies   steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations   and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket    throughout the entire ordeal   jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes   which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps   eventually tristen wanders in   mutters something about   reverse     and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards    when they do this   they discover what really happened during the five lost hours       one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes    okay   if the videotapes were being buried   then how were they recording themselves       oh    nevermind      this movie was awful    simply awful    the characters are broadly drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development    erica is the nature loving wiccan    tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman    steven is the overbearing asshole    kim is the antisocial goth girl    old   tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures    how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic    because she s pregnant !  how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl    because she wears a lot of eye makeup !  how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy    because he has jagged teeth and talks like he s straight out of   deliverance   !  this is weak storytelling at its worst    rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic   the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics   in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action    it didn t work    on top of being poorly developed   most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid         honey   you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie    let s get on a plane home         no    i am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what s going on         ok        frankly   by the end of the movie   i was rooting for the witch    i also felt that there was simply too much blood  n  gore in this film    the first movie worked by never showing us the horror    the witch was a palpable presence in that movie   but we never saw it   we never saw anything   in fact    the horror was all off screen   and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be    this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie    blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross out    this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey s throat   and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort    knives plunge into flesh   bloody fingers trail off into the darkness   and none of it is explained until the very end   when it was too late for me to care    this movie didn t stop with showing us the gore   either   it went for broke and showed us everything    by the end of the movie   there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours    it is all explained   in fact   it is all shown on screen in loving detail    i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster   or see only brief glimpses   mere suggestions of what the monster is   it is not because i find the monster so terrifying   but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying    i have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no   monster     that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind    i found this to be a miserably poor explanation   if it was in fact the director s intent   then he needs to have some words with the writer   because it was not made clear at all       i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds   none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so    and if there was no witch   then what about the vanishing tree    the snowfall of manuscript paper    hm      blair witch 2   book of shadows was a horrible movie    from the poorly written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross out shots   it was a bad effort through and through    
Neg, in   gia     angelina jolie plays the titular character   the first so called supermodel    and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome   in my eyes   anyway      i just don t see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film    despite this   i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie    sadly   though   my fears were realized    it s just not possible to make an interesting   full length film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes    the movie follows the rise and fall of gia   no last name     a tumultuous woman who doesn t particularly enjoy the world of fashion    she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle   and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have    the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high   losing a job   and going into rehab    this formula is repeated several times   and i really got tired of it    in general   i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use    no because it offends me or anything like that   it just bores me    quite frankly   i don t see the appeal   so when a director shows me a point of view shot of a junkie   complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices   i am left somewhat unimpressed    the first hour of the film   though   was actually quite engaging    we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend    these early scenes were interesting    we re shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes   and it was a perspective i hadn t seen before    the movie begins to go downhill   however   once gia becomes an established model    >from that point   i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end    it all seemed so excessive    fine   so gia had a drug problem   does this really need to dominate the film    couldn t the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs    or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world    quite possibly   although since i have no desire to become a model   this warning is lost on me    as i stated at the beginning of this review   i simply don t see how the life of a model is worthy of a feature length motion picture    what do they do that warrants a movie    strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour    i suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players   for example   but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life    gia did not    and by the end of the film   all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling   was bi sexual   and was heavily into drugs    not exactly a meaningful contribution to society   as far as i m concerned    
Pos, john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles    so effortlessly that people tend to forget he s there   much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors   anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor s face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors      example   the other day my mother asked me   the expert   of course   if there were any movies out worth seeing   never mind that our tastes couldn t be more divergent    i ll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes   and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go !  was a lot of fun   which it is     so i didn t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation    i muttered   with a little trepidation   that she might enjoy high fidelity    she responded with her usual query     whose in that one      this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see    if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light   a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing   and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people   usually of the jewish faith   fretting about in some upper east side palace    anyway   when i answered   john cusack     she replied with a rather stunned   who       as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to    now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies   most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin   but i suppose it s understandable that she would not recognize the name   after all   for most   names are tougher than faces    i showed her a picture of cusack s mug in the paper hoping for an   oh   him   yes he s quite good   instead i got a   no   i don t know him      at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger   yes   filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone     till i realized something   i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack s relatively bland visage   or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise   one syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car    cu sack   cu sack   no   not quite as cool    i m sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as   the guy from   add in the cusack film of your choice        he s not a brand name   and his movies usually aren t big moneymakers   but in his own unassuming way he s kind of a genius    with his pleasant   common man looks   and charming semi articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90 s    from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon    despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it   the schlumpy every man     he s a constantly enjoyable screen persona   like albert brooks or woody allen    and he knows how to chose scripts   while the stephan baldwin s and val kilmer s seem to put them selves in everything   the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle   and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent     cusack generally picks rewarding projects   save for the unwatchable hot pursuit   a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller      high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears   the grifters   the hi lo country     and it s a hit    it was also co written by cusack   and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy   grosse point blank    it s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film   but as it progresses in its meandering fashion   the movie cast something of a spell over me    high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non committal rob   a vinyl record store owner   who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his   top 5 break ups list      this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller s day off    at first the talking directly into the camera schtick had me vaguely annoyed   mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit   but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack s witty delivery    he s the kind of guy we don t mind talking directly to us    gradually the film settles into a shampoo like tragi comic character study   of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is   yes it s all very existential      though that plot line is mostly enjoyable   the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters   all of whom   now this is really something   are terrific enough to warrant their own films    the best of which is jack black   of the very funny show tenacious d   a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis  hair       unfortunately that annoying smirk remains     an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy    he s the kind of guy i m sure we ve all met before   a blowhard who thinks he s always right and will do anything in his power   be it yell   argue   insult   to hoist his opinion onto others    but i like this guy   because of how black plays him    the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes   but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak   which might be a bit of a redundant description   seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic      he s the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films       look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister      but fears and black never let that happen    the character   for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality    he s over the top   but in a way we can all probably relate to    catherine zeta jones   in her brief role   gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own   charm      tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age type   a character played entirely for cartoon yuks   but still manages to work its desired comic effect    the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy   the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle   mifune     who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent   replacing it with a stilted american phonation    i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role   but instead of being likeable   she comes across as rather robotic   and as such it s hard to see why cusack s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful   intelligent writer   natasha gregson wagner   potentially waiting in the wings    this reminded me of say anything   where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye   and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood   whose unbelievably more wooden then father   clint for those   special people   whose wheels turn a little slower      in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his   though i d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles   the result would be more effective    high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances    fears  direction is somewhat stilted   and the script is sometimes a little too   and this is a word i m beginning to hate to use but alas i must   quirky for its own good   i think i ll blame that on scott rosenberg   who judging from what he did with beautiful girls   con air   and things to do in denver while your dead   has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie      but cusack really does deserve an award   for being so damn       cusackian    i m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent    his character   rob   whose sort of like an older   more bitter lloyd from say anything   is funny and tragic without being pathetic   and that cusack can do all this   and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences   is something of an achievement    
Pos, most people fit into two different categories   you either love woody allen   or you hate his guts    my family   for the most part   hates him and his movies    i think he s very funny   but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years    so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of    unrestrained by physical boundaries   allen s humor comes shining through    those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen s intelligent observations of life    those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one    in 1995   a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they d never seen before    toy story used state of the art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present    many critics will call that a better film   but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture    antz   however   has upped the ante considerably    disney s a bug s life isn t due out for another two months   and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal    by beating disney out   they have satisfied the audience s thirst for computer animated films    but don t let that fool you   disney is definitely not scared    in the past two years   competitions have broken out between studios    in 1997   it was the volcano duel    in my opinion   dante s peak came out way ahead of its predecessor   both in time and in quality    volcano had an original premise   but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations    in 1998   there are twice as many competing films    first was the comet competition   and armageddon blew away it s cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact    but now   it s even more interesting   as one beloved studio   disney   goes up against the newcomer   dreamworks      who will prevail    time will tell   but i m sure that mr   mouse has nothing to fear    this may sound like i didn t like antz   on the contrary   i d put it up there with toy story    but due to it s pg rating   many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn t appear in disney s version    some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family oriented film    sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally   which makes dreamworks  animated feature geared more for an adult crowd    the humor is also written especially for adults   though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended    this is the type of film that should be made for families more often   entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents    antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen s shtick and franz kafka s metamorphosis   the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug    z   allen   is a troubled ant   believing he was not made to be a worker       when you re the middle child in a family of five million         he comments about his neglected childhood    one night   z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver   sylvester stallone     discussing his pathetic place in life    in walks princess bala   sharon stone     whom no one recognizes without a crown    bala asks z is he would like to dance   and they engage in a pulp fiction esque dance while everyone else is following the leader    after discovering that she is the princess   z falls in love   but there s a problem   bala is getting married to general mandible   gene hackman     a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony    in order to do that   he must eliminate not only the queen   anne bancroft     but the weakest of the colony   namely the worker ants    but to get rid of the queen   he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her    he and colonel cutter   christopher walkin   come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle   where they will surely be killed    the queen is reluctant at first   but decides it is best for the colony    meanwhile   z wants to meet bala again   and he asks weaver   an army ant   to switch places with him    so z gets sent off to battle   but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites    the battle sequence is absolutely stunning   though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers   which contained a very similar sequence    however   antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time   so the similarities are merely coincidence    the second half of the film revolves around z s kidnapping of bala   and their search for a mythical place called insectopia    there   an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants    the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension   especially one involving a magnifying glass    looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day   in fact   i m just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally      the ants look up in awe   and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground    visually   it s an exciting rush of adrenaline    but don t be fooled        little kids shouldn t see this   as they may just try and copy it    after seeing antz   i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again    hopefully   children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel    as an animated film   antz is probably the best you will find to date    visually   it s as stunning as what dreams may come    the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren t limited by gravity    they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible    one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball    the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball    however   the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy s shoe    it s truly a great example of film making at its finest    with computer technology   the animators have carefully made the ants  faces look similar to the actors providing the voices    the best example would have to be barbatus   danny glover      at one point   you can even see the pores on his face   although   i doubt ants have pores        do they        barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body    young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head   but a good deal of humor is derived   more appropriate for adults   of course      disney s a bug s life looks good   but i don t know if they will be able to best dreamworks  newest animated feature in terms of animation    if not   then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do   go head to head with the big mouse   and knock him down   yes   anastasia was good   but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney      vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature   and antz has one of the best line ups seen since toy story    in fact   it far exceeds that one    woody allen has always been funny   but here he transcends most of what he s done in the past few years    without a body   his comic timing is the most noticeable thing    in fact   i m pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines    sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability   though for the most part   stone works best as a dramatic actress    sylvester stallone   teamed up with stone once again   is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor   not a typecast action star    after a snub at the oscars last year   stallone is proving himself as the serious   or comedic   as illustrated here   actor that he is    gene hackman is superb as the gruff talking general   almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona    christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice   and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns    anne bancroft has a minimal role   but she s effective nonetheless    danny glover has a small role   but he does a very   very good job    dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick   euro trash bees  both are very unrecognizable   especially aykroyd    jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver   although most people won t recognize her voice either    many people will recognize grant shaud s voice as the foreman    he played miles on the tv show murphy brown    this is definitely a huge cast with some high profile names   and it will definitely help it s grosses    of course   you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to   also    directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers   though guterman did direct a 1994 feature   headless !      but both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture    tense at times   and very funny throughout   the two hold this film together like professionals    the screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot   but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults    kids will delight in the animation   while parents can laugh heartily at the humor    most of it will go over young children s heads    does that mean you shouldn t take kids to see it    not at all    they will have a lot of fun watching this one    what is great is the themes that are given to us    part social commentary   part romance story   and part moral drama   antz gives everyone something to talk about   whether it be the animation   or the discussions of individualism and community    thankfully   it s not subtle in either aspects    antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action    sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie   but the violence is what should keep kids at home    the battle scene has ants melting in acid   and bugs being speared to death    and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight    but other than that   and some sexual innuendos     it s a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters    i doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough   but it s still advisable to leave really young children at home    have i confused you enough    if you do take your kids   i recommend seeing the film with them   because more than likely   you ll enjoy it the most    
Neg, note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned       quick   robin !  the anti shark repellant !      adam west in the 1966 batman feature film   casually kicking at a pathetic looking rubber shark attached to his leg  i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness   but in many instances batman and robin nears   and at some point even exceeds this standard    this is a disasterously bad film   easily the worst in the series to date   and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive   it s loud   garish   and obnoxious   with pointless   gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill    batman and robin features the caped crusaders   george clooney debuting as batman   with chris o donnell returing as robin   squaring off against another bevy of chemically induced villains   the nefarious ice cold mr   freeze   arnold schwarzenegger     armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights   and the slinky poison ivy   uma thurman     who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her   not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result   but whatever     and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss    by ivy s side is the giant steroid monster bane   jeep swanson     a grunting hulk of a beast    the villains  goals are noble ones   freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit   in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees     so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife   vendela     dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation   and ivy s intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth   albeit by destroying all human life    meanwhile   on the homefront   life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth   michael gough     and the arrival of his niece barbara   alicia silverstone      akiva goldsman s screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad   with astonishingly terrible dialogue   lame jokes   and an awful by the number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement    it makes goldsman s screenplay of batman forever   which i thought was dreadful   look positively inspired in comparison    i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i d seen used in   no joke   an episode of gilligan s island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production    joel schumacher s direction of batman and robin is horrific   with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance    there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film   even moreso than with his previous batman forever   with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo   just in case   i suppose   if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin     and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy s chosen new abode    another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons    mr   schumacher s focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible   to the detriment of the story   there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all out camp and heartfelt drama   with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective    it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film s opening   even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered    is batman and robin supposed to be campy    i think it is   it s hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously       one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted   bomb !    each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory      is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be    i somehow doubt it   the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn t attempting to be the utter farce which it is    arnold schwarzenegger is top billed in the film as the villainous mr   freeze   and is bland and uninteresting   perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be    mr   schwarzenegger s attempts to be menacing are laughable   and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable   frankly   everything he does onscreen is laughable    by the end of the film   i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen    the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near unintelligble puns and one liners featuring every possible permutation of   cool !    in the least inventive way    george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin   being overshadowed by the villains   and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film    his batman is hardly an imposing figure    chris o donnell is unimpressive in a one note performance   while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all    the film s one saving grace    undoubtably uma thurman s entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy    her work in batman and robin is certainly over the top   but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film    ms   thurman s comic timing is impeccable   and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully       i m already starting to positively reassess jim carrey s performance in batman forever      her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film   and when she s offscreen the film greatly suffers    i figure that if one has to die   being kissed to death by uma thurman isn t a half bad way to go    while batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse pounding excitement   i must admit that i was not bored watching it   although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening   my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one liner   and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat    it s been a long time since i ve laughed so much at a movie       at     of course   is the operative word    
Neg, numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci fi   suspense thrillers    soldier is a multi   crossbreed between the likes of terminator   aliens and offspring    the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel   not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground    besides this   the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age    the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured   slow and sluggish   and could have done with better choreography    russell who is usually a good actor in b grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character   sergeant todd   who seems more like a sergeant toad    besides having almost no dialogue   his character appears stunted   zombie like which is in line with his screen persona   but scores little points of empathy with the audience    this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson   whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth    although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former   it is still a long way from anything considered desirable    
Neg, recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldn t sleep    he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour    then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food    then he took down a volume of shakespeare s work and read it cover to cover   never really paying attention to the words or plot    and then   as a climax   he took out his video camera and pressed the   on   button    the result    william shakespeare s romeo + juliet   the worst film ever made and a complete failure    though   to be fair   an interesting complete failure    the idea at the film s core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds    this is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we can t see what is going on    and filming the dialogue in voice over    and shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model    and making the frame go still while flashing the character s name at the bottom    and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion    i mean   man   this is the 90s   dude    however i ve seen terrible films that are fun to watch       examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau       that rule doesn t apply here    this is a film that takes itself seriously    that is it s major fault    another problem was pointed out by my friend   alex   who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout         the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and didn t take sides    here it s clear that we are supposed to side with romeo       just look at the way they film him       from the begining he s our hero and this doesn t work    and dicaprio s awful performance doesn t help    luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us    the result is a mess    you can feel him striving to be something he isn t    he tries to pull of a mix in which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles    he tries very hard    key word   tries       oh look   he s filming above water action from below    pretty    what does it represent      why do people do ugly things    i scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if i could never read the play again and keep a straight face    
Pos, synopsis   it s 1977 in a small italian american neighborhood in new york    disco music is popular   and the sexual revolution is on   but the people of new york are not happy    in fact   they re terrified    as in spike lee s do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip   and peoples  tempers are flaring    the cool of night offers no respite   the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam    no one knows who the son of sam is   and no one is safe    all around new york people are different    aside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals    in the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny   john leguizamo   tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna   mira sorvino      vinny s friend ritchie   adrien brody   hates disco   works at a gay strip club and doesn t want any of the neighborhood folks to know    ritchie s girl ruby   jennifer esposito   is trying to escape a reputation as a slut    everyone s different   but nobody in the film wants to be framed as   alien   to the community    unfortunately   the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor    opinion   director spike lee s summer of sam is not about a psycho killer    nor is it about cops trying to apprehend him    it s about differences and how   given the right conditions   even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion    one thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex    in other movies sex is glamorized    for example   james bond gets a sexual reward for winning    or boring made for video   suspense   movies are spiked with gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake    and every movie or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess    not so with summer of sam    in a very gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy    sex is there   but it isn t gratuitous or titillating    in fact   some of the main characters are downright lousy in bed    sex is in the film because   sexual   deviance is part of the film s major theme of   difference   breeding hostility    in my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999   as rare and thought provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking    
Neg, the first film produced by adam sandler s happy madison production company   clever title eh     is essentially a one joke movie   much like the movies sandler stars in himself    however the difference here is that this one joke just isn t very funny    rob schneider stars as the title character   a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a   man whore   to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client s custom made fish tank   which deuce destroyed while staying in his home    deuce goes on numerous   dates     and each woman he goes out with has a   humorous   quirk about herself    one has narcolepsy   one has tourette s syndrome   one is a man        etc   etc    my problem is that we see all of these women in the film s trailer   so why do i need to watch the movie    seen the trailer        seen the film    only a quick cameo from norm macdonald   and a follow up joke during the closing credits   generates any chuckles    deuce bigalow   male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video   a division of di$ney      the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1   85   1   and features the original theatrical trailer   as well as trailers for mystery alaska   happy texas   and outside providence     an extremely brief production featurette   which contains footage not used in the film     and storyboard to scene comparisons    yep   you read that right        there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd    two scenes are storyboarded        neither of which are particularly exciting    there are fight scenes in this movie   so why aren t we seeing storyboards of those segments   especially the parody moments from the matrix      i wonder what s funnier   the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that di$ney thought fans of this film would want to see them    deleted scenes    sure    audio commentary    you betcha    but storyboards    come on    [r]  
Neg, the first species was a moderately successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects   a few well  paced action sequences   and frequent views of model turned actress natasha henstridge sans clothing    however   it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel    and   considering the quality of species 2   it s obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead    the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is    if you throw away the plot   which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence   logic   coherence   and consistency   species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience    of course   that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys   who   at least in theory   shouldn t be able to get into an   r    rated film   and connoisseurs of bad movies    there s enough blood   gore   simulated sex   and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring    this is a grade z exploitation flick that s ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment    somewhere   someplace   i recall hearing species 2 described as   erotic      i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie   because he   or she   has a peculiar notion of eroticism    sure   there s a lot of sex and nudity   but it s almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman s abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free   splattering blood and gore in all directions    anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater    i suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge   and   to get the obvious question out of the way    yes   she does remove her top   but only once   and only briefly      although the character she played in the original species is dead   government scientists still have the dna   and   out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse   they decide to create another clone    this creature   dubbed   eve   by its creator   dr   laura baker   played by marg helgenberger   reprising her role     is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile    meanwhile   man has finally set foot on mars    a team of three   led by patrick ross   justin lazard     has traveled to the red planet   but when they return to earth   they bring something with them    ross has become a half human/half alien hybrid   and he s soon mating like crazy   collecting the blood soaked children that are the result of each sex session    his intention is obviously world domination    standing in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film   preston lennox   michael madsen     and one of patrick s fellow astronauts   dennis gamble   mykelti williamson      but when patrick learns about eve   a female of his kind   there s no damping his ardor    i m not sure what the budget for species 2 was   but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors   as opposed to being diverted into the special effects      michael madsen and marg helgenberger   both back for a second round   are clearly on hand to do as little as they can   grab the money   and run    ditto for james cromwell   who plays patrick s father      underused   is too kind a word to describe his involvement     invisible   would be more like it      george dzundza gets to do a little scenery  chewing as an angry but inept general    meanwhile   justin lazard s performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge s limited abilities look good by comparison    the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson   who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick    complete with cheesy special effects   bare breasts around every narrative corner   and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter   species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics    director peter medak   a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume   has added another forgettable title   but at least he appears to have had fun doing it   which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness    do i recommend the movie    absolutely not   but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn t try my patience to the degree that some pseudo intellectual bad movies do    here s hoping there s no species 3    
Pos, the most common   and in many cases the only   complaint against francis ford coppola s 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia   which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour   loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler   kinder ages    martin scorsese   another italoamerican moviemaker   confronted that perspective with his own   more down to earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets   movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime    unfortunately for scorsese   his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola s influence on mafia portrayals in the movies    seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime    this film was goodfellas   epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s    goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story   told in best seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi   who would co write the screenplay for the film      the book   as well as the film   chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill   played by ray liotta     irish italian criminal from new york    at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero   played by paul sorvino     local mob boss   and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands    after couple of years   together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito   played by joe pesci     he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway   played by robert de niro      three of them spend years as best friends and associates   gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history    wealth   influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen   played by lorraine bracco     who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities   domestic abuse   arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business    but the perfect world of   wiseguys   gradually begins to fall apart   tommy s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence   jimmy s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and   finally   henry s own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends    goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory    scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker    world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating    scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence   hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime   yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny    after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history   based on some notorious real life events     the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths   trading the superficial and short lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens    scorsese also manages to break viewer s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material   scenes that depict personal tragedies   broken homes   human depravity   violence   bloodshed and murder   in all their uncompromising reality   but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience    with the use of ironic soundtrack   manipulative shots   character s dialogue or narrator s commentary   goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era    even if we don t pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining   we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker    first   we might notice unusual structure of the plot   relatively minor subplot is used as movie s ironic prologue    then   instead of single narrator   scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards    this multiple points of views   both in terms of narration and various subjective shots   only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation    same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack    nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy listening 1950s pop songs   while depression   paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s    but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment   almost pastoral   easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed    however   thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people    such scenes   although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings   became very popular among other directors in 1990s    fragmentary character of the screenplay   which doesn t have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes   gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese    he uses this structure of film to experiment   and most successful of such experiments is hilarious   a day in life   segment near the end of the film    another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents    the most respectable among them is robert de niro   but his character   who happen to be most quiet and business like member of criminal trio   gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues    joe pesci deserved his   oscar   for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy   and his lines   including ad libs   probably represent the most memorable element of the film    ray liotta   although equally talented   perhaps doesn t look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film    liotta s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low level street thugs    liotta   on the other hand   improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction    lorraine bracco is   on the other hand   very effective and believable as karen hill   wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband    paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso   and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave    as a combination of clever sociological study   black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do   work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time    because of this achievement   and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers   this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s    
Neg, there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see   mission to mars      there are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it   and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind    but there are those who will not   and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies     2001   a space odyssey       armageddon       apollo 13       the abyss       close encounters of the third kind       e   t    the extra terrestrial       alien     and   aliens      why    because there is not one original idea in   mission to mars      all of it is cribbed from other films   and in most cases   better films      if this is the sort of thing you don t mind   you might like the film    of course   there are other reasons not to like   mission to mars     the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven t used their brains in some time   and who don t intend to start during the film s running time       mission to mars   manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time    the plot   cribbed greatly from   2001     concerns a team sent to mars   the first manned trip ever made to the red planet    luke graham   don cheadle   leads the team   jointly formed of americans and russians    the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse   this being nothing like the pulse emitting monolith in   2001      that one was on the * moon *     but when they try to study it   a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them   all except luke   who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station   which looks strangely like the rotating space station in   2001        a rescue mission is planned with husband & wife team woody blake   tim robbins   and terri fisher   connie nielsen     obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell   gary sinise     and extra crew member phil ohlmyer   jerry o connell   along for the ride    after some zero gravity dancing   they run into problems when one of their engines is blown   forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel    now stranded on mars with minimal supplies   the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home    after all   that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth       mission to mars   is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it   so let s start with one of the things that does work   director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film    that s it    everything else fails    the failure isn t de palma s fault   he s working from an atrocious script    only during the sequence aboard the ship   looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in   2001     where the rescue team s air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does   mission to mars   come to life    a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension   until you realize that the entire danger/more danger/attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film   it s just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes    take it out   and the plot isn t affected in any way    the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes   as does the rest of the film     why is the ship s computer   which sounds strangely like hal from   uh     2001     able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine    why did tim robbins  character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside    shouldn t the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach    why are the characters such idiots    because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them    all the   conflict   is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene   which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot   during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know     jim   it s too bad you can t go on this mission because you were determined  psychologically inadequate  because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together      does anyone really talk like this    can t we find out these things in a less grating matter   like maybe in a flashback    the whole film is like that    the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what s going on   they must * tell * us exactly what we re looking at * every * time    sample dialogue from the film     shot of mars   astronaut a     look   there s mars   astronaut b     you sure that s mars      astronaut a     yeah   that s mars all right      astronaut c     hey   are you guys looking at mars      that exchange isn t actually in   mission to mars     but i wouldn t be surprised if it were    for all their cribbing from kubrick   spielberg   james cameron   and even ron howard   the makers of this film haven t learned to do something all those directors did very well   show and don t tell    de palma used to know how   but seems to have forgotten    this is mentally challenged filmmaking   they assume the audience won t get what s going on   so they explain everything five times over    fourth graders may appreciate this   but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted    the principal actors sleepwalk their way through   mission to mars     never managing to do away with an apparent   i m just here to get a paycheck   attitude    cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines    armin mueller stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo    robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard   decent guy   performance    and sinise hams it up with   wistful   facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife   played by kim delaney   who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy handed monologue about the meaning of life     and especially during the stolen from no less than three movies   a lollipop to whoever names them   conclusion   which combines endless   obvious explanation and sub par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then    and of course   these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in   2001   who facilitated the evolution of life on earth   those aliens were from an * unknown * world    it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy   mission to mars     but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow going    leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it   but all of the substance of   mission to mars   has been stolen from other films   and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters    supposedly we re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one   totally different from the one character decides not to return ending of   armageddon       but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning    me   i alternated between the two    there is only one good thing about the way   mission to mars   finally ends   the fact that the movie is over    
Pos, this christmas   little ralphie parker   peter billingsley   wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree    although cautioned by many that he will   shoot his eye out    ralphie remains optimistic   conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers    it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun   and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one    `a christmas story  is a favorite among many during the holiday season   and boy   it is certainly easy to see why    ralphie s endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood   when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable    evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things `a christmas story  does so well    here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season    1   period detail    this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard   who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940 s with loving detail    shepard narrates from a first person point of view   divulging his various adventures one snowy december   in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head    shepard s first hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious   but also witty and warm   with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing    on top of that   young billingsley s stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration    director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality    i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like    2   mom and dad    both melinda dillon   as mom   and darren mcgavin   as   the old man    are perfect in their roles    it s hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one   with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured    for instance   he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound   and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues    in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild mannered young lad   peter billingsley has struck quite the chord    his performance is richly textured   making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment    which brings us to          3   the comic situations    there are plenty of memorable moments in `a christmas story     moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing   with so much more to explore and to cherish    i am particularly partial of the   f word scene    in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard    again   shepard s method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry    the numerous sequences that stick in one s mind include   of course   the famous department store santa scene   in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree    i could go on   but i ll finish on this note   `a christmas story  is a standout among holiday movies   because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes    not only is it funny   it s often genuinely hilarious         not to mention warm   fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places    i plan on making `a christmas story  a christmas tradition    why don t you    
Pos, unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi   an artist whose palette is fabric    ostensibly   the film is a documentary   but use of that term requires stretching its meaning    many scenes appear staged   and a great deal of cutting and pasting has been done in the editing room    the cinema verite effect is a conceit    genuine spontaneity is at a premium   and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera   especially would be actresses like cindy crawford      director douglas keeve   who was mizrahi s lover at the time   freely admits that he   couldn t care less about the truth   but was more interested in capturing   the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion      despite violating nearly every rule of   legitimate   documentary film making   however   unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment    while it sheds only a little light on the behind the scenes world of the fashion industry   it presents a fascinating   if incomplete   picture of designer mizrahi    this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study    he s funny   energetic   and eminently quotable    he has unusual views on just about everything   from fashion     it s about women not wanting to look like cows     to mary tyler moore     between her and jackie kennedy   they shaped this country     to style     it s almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs        unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress    it s almost certainly different that anyone would imagine    the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look   including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies   then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection    in particular   unzipped traces mizrahi s development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show   which highlights a number of prominent models   including cindy crawford   naomi campbell   kate bush   and linda evangelista    on the technical side   a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped    a variety of film stocks were used   super 8   16 mm black and white   and 35 mm color    there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness    the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie   and   during the climactic fashion show   color is used to show the audience s perspective   while black and white is for the behind the  scenes sequences    nevertheless   some viewers will be put off by this treatment    while unzipped isn t an expose on the fashion industry per se   keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear    overall   however   this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else   and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed    when the designer declares that   everything is frustrating except designing clothes    that s beautiful and liberating     it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed    
Neg, what were they thinking    nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough   but do we really need an eighties film    robbie hart   adam sandler   used to want to be a rock and roll star   but in 1985 he s singing at weddings and having a good time    a romantic at heart   he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his high school sweetie    when she leaves him waiting at the altar   his tune changes to   love stinks      he meets waitress julia   drew barrymore   who is engaged to a junk bonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together    in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie    sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role   but there is no spark    barrymore doesn t seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it   beauty but no attitude    both characters are just there    bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show    the eighties are shoved in our face    references to deloreans   madonna     dallas     ivana and donald   burt and loni and   miami vice   get old fast    the filmmakers must have realized that there wasn t much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions    they re not funny and it doesn t work    with change on all fronts accelerating more and more   nostalgia appears to have a great appeal   but don t you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past    maybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino       michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be      
Pos, 50 s `aliens vs    earth  idea revamped !  if you have been following the movie news over the net   you could not have escaped the hype over id4    it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary    id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july   and up till now   only after a week of release   it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark   a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993    the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple   earth defends itself against the aliens   a typical and highly popular 50 s hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era    the movie opens via star wars   however unoriginal it may be   it worked    the aliens have sent a large mother ship   supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon   to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth    the us president   pullman   does not know of the aliens  intention but soon finds out when david   goldblum   a scientist   discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities    capt   hiller   smith     a hot shot f 18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc    his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders   he crash lands after a spectacular 1 on 1 chase over the grand canyon   one of the many highlights of the movie    id4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses    acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle   do we smell a bit of braveheart here          no prizes for guessing how id4 ends   its just plain obvious    id4 borrows heavily from star wars   return of the jedi   alien and in some parts of the movie   i could even sense a bit of x files on screen    if i were to critically review this movie   id4 is full of plot holes   corny dialogue   and ridiculously dumb aliens    however below that wafer thin plot and on screen flaws   id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion    an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie   thus maintaining a screen viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable   no matter how ridiculous    id4 was produced under a modest budget of us$68 million   a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich   universal soldier   stargate   and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company    some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable   especially the epic standoff between 150 f 18 s and 250 alien saucers   reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi    id4 is a movie for all    though there are many explosions and implied deaths   there are no gory scenes of human destruction   thus young kids should be able to take it    sit back and don t be too critical   chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was    if you are not planning to watch any movies this year   please   at least make time for this one    this film is best watched on the big screen    
Neg, an american werewolf in london is john landis  groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england    the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects    more specifically   the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf   and for the ghosts that haunt the main character    even twenty years after its release   that part of the movie is still impressive    although   i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive    the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure    if it weren t for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980    and with good reason    the acting isn t great and neither is the writing    well ok   we don t actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film    but one other important element is lacking here too    it isn t scary    with no exception   you know what is going to happen before it happens    you don t even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint    i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen    but john   it just wasn t scary    i didn t know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it   but it didn t work for me    actually   it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films    but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad   the intended humor was lost on me    it s never a good sign that you don t realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material    call me crazy   but you shouldn t have to do research on a movie to enjoy it    i m not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much   since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up    werewolf bites boy   david naughton      boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse   jenny agutter   and then strange things begin to happen to boy    including   and i must admit this is a very nice touch   visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital    the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse    i know it sounds strange   but it actually works    the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy   griffin dunne   are really the best parts of the movie    as i said   probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects    while they are still impressive today   they aren t impressive enough   or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film    and since they are more or less the highlight of the film   there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch    actually   the 1998 sequel   an american werewolf in paris   is more entertaining since it doesn t take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way    
Neg, arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar   go to the movies   fall in love   move in together   etc    review ======  well   if you haven t seen when harry met sally or he said   she said   or if you don t watch love & war on television   you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages    however   if you ve seen any of these   than you have seen most of this film    this of course doesn t mean its bad    some of it is amusing   but overall   i just had to ask what s the point    arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love    kevin pollack is the stereotypical female fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes   most if which weren t very funny    couteney cox is the stereotypical career minded woman who falls in love    julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman       notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical    this film uses a lot of formula   the plot is basically known from the opening credits      so what is good about the movie    well as i said there are a few amusing moments    surprisingly   julie brown   who i usually find just plain goofy   was the best thing in the film    also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual    gee   this is really short    not much to say about the film really    it is just kind of there    watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time   but i wouldn t recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre

Pos, driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small   intimate story    it s a quiet film   a slow film   a deliberate film    but if you re patient with it   the movie offers innumerable rewards   such as a pair of self assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy    driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry s pulitzer prize winning play of the same name   which first opened in new york four years ago    the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago   los angeles   london   vienna   norway   and the soviet union    uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy   he also penned the wonderful sleeper   mystic pizza    the film   like the play   is set in atlanta   georgia   and it revolves around two people in their twilight years   a cranky   70 something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60 something black man who becomes her chauffeur    the movie relies on character   rather than plot   to propel the action    in fact   the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense   it doesn t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together    rather   driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life   shopping   listening to the radio   visiting the cemetery   eating fried chicken   and so on    the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta s history   including the 1958 bombing of the temple   the city s oldest jewish congregation   and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr   martin luther king   jr    the story begins in 1948 with daisy   tandy   crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway    the insurance company cancels her insurance   and her son   boolie   decides to hire her a chauffeur    freeman   reprising his role from the play   plays the chauffeur   hoke    the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger    driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature   aging   prejudice   and a great many other things   but more than anything it s about a relationship   one that spans 25 years   4 cars   the advent of civil rights   and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon    daisy is strong willed and set in her ways   and   from the outset   she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur    initially   she treats hoke with contempt   refusing to let him drive her anywhere    once she does get in the car   daisy is the ultimate back seat driver    to make matters worse   she is extremely self conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand    eventually   however   daisy is worn down by hoke s good natured charm and infectious cheer   she softens and opens up to him    tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well   but unfortunately this feisty   cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace    we ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations   from on golden pond to cocoon    nevertheless   tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own    freeman   as hoke   on the other hand   gives the more distinctive of the two performances    there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color    hoke is uneducated and illiterate   but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man   an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior    both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element   in full command of their natural charisma    they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves    they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie s gentle humor    at the same time   tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama    in his first dramatic role   dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie   tandy s loving and patient son    drama seems to agree with aykroyd   taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor   especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently   ghostbusters ii   the great outdoors   my stepmother is an alien      the only other significant characters in the film are daisy s housekeeper   idella   marvelously played by esther rolle     good times       and boolie s pretentious wife   played by patti lupone    under the direction of bruce beresford   crimes of the heart   tender mercies     driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again    but fortunately   beresford never forgets he s shooting a movie   and accordingly   he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches   such as gorgeous shots of flowers   trees   and tomatoes    in adapting driving miss daisy from

Pos, losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing    reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare    while we all might feel the desire to blow someone s head off with a shotgun when they don t seem to grasp our point of view   actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid    this isn t the case with sam baily   john travolta s slightly askew average joe persona in mad city       i don t think people listen to guys like me     sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum    just a few days ago   sam was a guard at this same museum   but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position   sam s apprehension resulted in a brash decision    in an effort to get his ex boss   museum director mrs   banks   blythe danner     to   just listen     he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun   taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage    sam s overall concern is valid enough   if he loses his job   his paycheck   his benefits   etc     his wife and two children won t be provided for    he s not a lunatic or a hot tempered madman   he s somewhat like a child   panicky   compulsive   and running on emotion   and his naive intentions aren t helped any by the fact that banks wasn t overly compassionate with the let go    overall   he s just like you and me   except that he has the capacity to view the line we d deem   far enough   as the starting mark of some crazy race    meanwhile   television reporter max brackett   dustin hoffman   is also on the scene    covering a   fluff   story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks   max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest breaking news story he ever could ve hoped for    having been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting   max is anxious to turn this into his   and only his   story    max immediately bonds with sam    max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone    at first   max s intentions don t stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole pride factor   but as he gets to know sam more personally   he begins to sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him    the media   however   is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill    the accidental shooting of ex co  worker cliff   bill nunn     a black security guard   becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sam s honest ambitions    also involved in this film are robert prosky as lou potts   head of the news department of the station max falls directly under   and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander   who uses his network power to try and outshine max    alda and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities    then there is mia kirshner   who plays the young tv station intern laurie    she falls under max s wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting    kirshner s credits are relatively small for now   including roles in films like exotica and the forgettable sequel to the crow    still   kirshner s character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and kinda bitchy in a reserved way roles    i wouldn t mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts   where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully onscreen    while the viewpoint of the media as a greedy   self righteous monster has indeed been tackled before   mad city provides a solid two hours of enjoyability    hoffman and travolta are both excellent actors   and seeing them together is a real treat    they both do a great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters   and they provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both    there is quite a bit of humor in this film   and without it   it could ve fallen into a drab   cliched social statement more likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause    this isn t a flick that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart   but it will lightly touch both   making for a recommendable movie    if for nothing more than the opportunity to watch both hoffman and travolta at the same time   i urge you to check this one out    
Pos, luckily   some people got starship troopers    some people knew it was supposed to be silly    for those of you who didn t   how could you miss it    from the very beginning   when we see an interactive internet like promotional video for the armed forces of the future   it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly    i guess without blatant one liners and home alone style slapstick   some people just don t recognize such goofy humor    such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned    first thing to do before seeing this movie   lighten up    meet the equivalent of   beverly hills 90210   meets   mighty morphin power rangers      four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces   which   in the future   means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country    johnny rico   casper van dien   is ready to join the infantry   mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez   denise richards   has enlisted to be a pilot    dizzy flores   dina meyer   has enlisted as a trooper   and it s possible she s joining merely to follow rico   whom she s always had eyes for    if you saw these three on the street   you d automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers   for never has a movie s cast looked so much like the cut out cover of   seventeen   magazine    the lone non supermodel   carl jenkins   played by doogie howser himself   neil patrick harris   is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division   the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie   er   carl out of the picture       good call   now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters      right off the bat   rico becomes the star of the show   far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time    but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise   which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen   leaves rico ready to call it quits    with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on   johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home    well sorry   rico suave   but there s no place like home   especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it    that s right   the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid like alien beings that a can of raid just isn t going to destroy    with a sudden change of heart   and clothes     rico is back in the game   following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs    what starship troopers really is   is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on   the soap opera like love affairs of high school   the love for sci fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group   etc   nothing is taken seriously    it s almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless   but with its sly and futuristic approach   it s not as recognizably so    it s a spoof so subtle that many won t recognize the spoofery    if you deem this as sci fi/action   you re wrong    it s sci fi/action/comedy   with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2   starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well    gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film   but the gore   too   is meant to be cheesy    yes   it s graphic   but it s also brutally phony   and that s what makes it such great fun to watch    not since the old   mr   bill   skits on   saturday night live   has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch    people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated    perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters  barbie dolls as young children    with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely   it s a good chance this is the case   whether we re fully aware of it or not    starship troopers has it s slow parts   but it s truly an alternative to your typical sci fi/action flick or lame juvenile comedy    aside from the intentionally cheesy gore   the special effects are quite astounding    when the spaceship passes a meteor   it s quite an awesome spectacle   visually crisp and captivating    if you re looking for brainless fun   this is the epitome of your search    a beautiful cast   awesome special effects   fast paced action   campy acting   and a whole lot of gore    this is brainless heaven    just remember not to think    
Pos, of the major horror sub genres   vampire movies are easily the most adaptable    think about it    frankenstein movies haven t changed all that much because they still need that mad scientist in bavarian castle setting    if you made a frankenstein movie today   you d have to have the monster be a virus or something    and outside of michael j   fox   there aren t any actors that could play a virus convincingly    movies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt    there s not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris   unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something       and there s that michael j   fox thing again      but you can have vampires do anything   and you can place them in any genre you want   just about    you can have traditional vampire movies   bram stoker s dracula   or have the anne rice version   interview with the vampire     or play it for laughs   vampire in brooklyn      you can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california   the lost boys   to squalid mexican dives   from dusk till dawn   to your local high school   buffy   the vampire slayer      were it not redundant   you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires    any day now   i expect we ll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record    or   you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie    and when you do that   you get blade    wesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie    the silent   expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path    in this case   the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead   bleeding corpses    snipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u   s   marshals   but does a demonstrably better job here as a half vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers    blade is a silent   brooding presence   laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse    he is as cold as his silver bladed sword   as single minded as his garlic filled bullets    yet   he s not without quirks   blade drives a battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent    like any good hong kong movie   blade is heavy on the chopsocky action    for some reason   blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti vampire weapons of garlic and silver       blade dismisses a man portable arc lamp as being too heavy   although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires      unfortunately   the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film   relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers   which it most strongly resembles    the replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i didn t review    mostly because it made no impression on me   and i couldn t remember anything other than noise   violence   and the intensity of fat s performance    blade has a little more going for it   and has the vampire myth to draw from    but other than that   it s the same kind of movie    exciting   with well choreographed action scenes   but with no resonance    with a stronger villain   stephen dorff is   pardon the pun   curiously bloodless as the head vampire   leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role     a wittier script   and a strong supporting cast   blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment    as it is   blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying    
Pos, richard gere can be a commanding actor   but he s not always in great films    everything comes together here    gere is a big time chicago defense attorney who takes on a seemingly unwinable case in hopes of even more publicity    it doesn t go exactly as he expects    gere s client   aaron   edward norton     is a shy stuttering tennessee boy who is accused of brutally murdering and mutilating a catholic archbishop    the evidence is stacked against him    he was caught running from the scene covered in the bishop s blood    his bloody footprints are all over the murder scene    he has a relationship with the priest    gere talks to the boy   believes that he is actually innocent and sets about finding the real killer    despite the lawyer s proclamations that he doesn t care about the guilt of his clients and that the real thrill is gambling with people s lives   he becomes involved with aaron and is determined to free him    lots of complications and twists    the prosecuting attorney is gere s former co worker and lover    they both work each other s motives to their legal advantages and it gets messy    her boss had major economic dealings with the archbishop that went sour and seems to have crime connections    aaron gets weirder and weirder as the trial goes on    gere s case is falling apart and he is faced with about a dozen ethical dilemmas    gere is exceptional as the well dressed reserved counselor   but just once   i wanted to see him kick back and come out of his   suit   persona    even when he loses it   you don t see very far inside    norton s aaron is convincing   he comes across as the backwoods kid misplaced in the big city    the supporting cast does a fine job of holding together the story    as with most of the effective courtroom dramas   the cinematography is crisp and rich    the story will keep you on the edge of your seat    nothing is what it seems    
Pos, robert altman s cookie s fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good    it is a sunny   delightful   dreamy comedy   filled with lovely performances   skillful direction and topped off with an understated   clever   extraordinary script    as this is an ensemble piece   it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters   all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs    first we meet willie   charles s   dutton     an honest man with a slight drinking habit    we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie   who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness   despair   and want of her dead husband    we cut to camille   glenn close   who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora   julianne moore      then we briefly get acquainted with emma   liv tyler     an apparent relative of cookie   who is a down but not out teen outcast   still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live    we also fleetingly see emma s lover jason   chris o donnell     an ambitious but far too excitable young cop    we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture   and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion    we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband    she exclaims   here i come !    and then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself    soon after   her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl   comes upstairs   finds cookie dead and flips out    convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family   she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow   yet sweet   sister that it was a murder    she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well   scattering jewelry all over the floor   breaking a few cabinets   windows and doors   and then throwing the gun out in the back yard    the only reasonable suspect is willie   who immediately gets taken into custody   and put in a jail cell   they all know he didn t do it   so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma      meanwhile   the unperturbed camille continues her none too subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success    so begins cookie s fortune   a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as   a southern spin on fargo     except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers  darker   somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade    robert altman s slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well   in that both films focus   on and off   on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town    indeed   most of the characters in cookie s fortune are loads of fun to observe   and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi  dimensional    glenn close turns in an insubstantial   in terms of her career   but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie   and she is perfectly cast as the prolific   aunt alexandria   character   endlessly obsessed with family dignity    the equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s   dutton   mimic   a time to kill    there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours   even days after the film ends    cookie s fortune is such a movie    i loved the light   kindhearted approach altman   whose last project was the dark   intense drama the gingerbread man   took towards the tricky subject matter    i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast    i even liked the trite   in the south everybody is related to everybody   cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close    i m not sure why cookie s fortune had such an all around pleasing effect on me    perhaps it s that good ol  southern charm    
Neg, the cartoon is way better    that s the bottom line on disney s incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature    the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic   home alone   with puppies   and not much else    when production of this remake was announced   the big question seemed to be   why    the original cartoon still works   so what s the point      the answer   it appears   is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign    the story   for those of you who missed childhood   is simple    two dalmatians   pongo and perdy   fall in love at first sight    they drag their   human pets   together   and in a short time both couples marry    the heavenly match ups turn chaotic when pongo and perdy s new born pups are stolen   their dog napping engineered by the evil cruella devil   who wants them for their pelts    everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies    in the original movie   the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities    we also could hear them talk   which quickly established a crucial element to the charm of the film   the dog s view of humans as their pets    in the new version   the dogs are mute and expressionless    hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks    while he drew the desired   aww   they re so cute   reaction from the audience   it was quickly followed by several people whispering   i wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dog s heads to get them licking like that      the canines  lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a little    joely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles    in previous films   daniels successfully played off his white bread persona    in   something wild     he revealed the rebellious thrill seeker beneath his neutral demeanor    in   terms of endearment     his hapless appearance masked a cold   manipulative womanizer    here   he and richardson are so consistently bland that it s a wonder their images even stick to the film    glenn close   however   has no problems establishing a distinct personality    as the villainous icon cruella devil   she tears up the screen in a deliciously over the top performance    close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself    with a two tone fright wig   red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips   garish animal skin outfits and stiletto heels   close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature    she s clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon   and her wicked glee is infectious    when she spits out lines like   you ve won the battle   but i m about to win the wardrobe !      the film comes briefly to life       101 dalmatians   is crammed with john hughes  typical heavy handed approach to comedy    after an ingenuous opening showing pongo s morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day   the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park   a little slapstick goes a long way   but hughes just keeps laying it on    the second half of the film   where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen   is a tedious home alone clone   with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy & scratchy cartoon   including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence       101 dalmatians   has cute puppies and a hoot of a performance from glenn close   but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick   bland characters   and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high fiving one another    rent the cartoon !  
Neg, tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy    robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss    he goes into depression   and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual  ghetto  side of every american city    there   lawernce attempts to steal his car   but to no avail   and is dragged along with robbin s on a trip to arizona    there   they hold up a store   are mistaken for two other robbers   just like in my cousin vinny   and are chased by the police   and the other robbers    of course   there s gags along the way   usually from lawernce    although the film is midly funny   and quite watchable   there s something so horribly familiar about it all    this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there s lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity   just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop   and pratically the same idea as midnight run    it s full of all the road movie cliches   and even has a  comedy  car chase   which just seemed so eighties    even the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin   or chevy chase   eighties comedy    there also isn t much chemistry between robbins and lawernce    in planes   trains and automobiles   there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy    in nothing to lose   there is hardly chemistry at all    towards the end the chemistry seems to work   but for the bulk of the film   there is hardly any    the director directs the film in a workman like fashion   but gets the jokes across    and although there is no chemistry between the two leads   they give good performances on their own    lawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance   and robbin s is alright aswell    however   robbin s performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob s ladder   and the player    in fact   if you want to see robbin s do comedy much better than in nothing to lose   i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy   where he is much funnier    nothing to lose does have some funny moments in it   however    the humour isn t particulary sophisticated   but if you enojyed dumb & dumber   you might enjoy this    the characters in arizona are funny   and there s also a good scene where robbin s asks a shopkeeper which  threatening approach  was better   lawerences   which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper s ass   and swearing a lot     or himselfs     which was speaking in a deep   scary voice   but the gags are predictable   the lack of chemistry infurating   and the ending too far fetched and  perfect   nothing to lose then   is robbin s first  bad  movie   and hopefully his last     and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film    he nearly ruined carrey s career with ace ventura   when nature calls   let s hope he hasn t ruined robbin s   or even lawerence s   with nothing to lose    
Pos, usually a movie is about something more than a soiled rug   but not the big lebowski    the new offering from the creators of 1996 s critical hit fargo   is to say the least   wildly entertaining    originality has always been a strong trait in the coen brother s movies   and the big lebowski is insanely original    it begins oddly enough when jeff   the dude   lebowski   jeff bridges   is mistaken for a millionaire   jeff   the big   lebowski   david huddleston     who s wife   bunny   tara reid   owes money all over town    two goons   out to collect on bunny s debt break into dude s house    they attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug    the next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team   steve buscemi & john goodman   respectively      he is advised to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defiled rug    he does this   and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper    this is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments    the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly    also several great supporting roles   john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus    the coen s script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make it extremely entertaining    i doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo   but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998    if you like anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one   if not they give this one a try its a little different    
Pos,    the deep end   uses a color palette of rich earth tones surrounded by a vast array of blues    alluring   attractive blues   but also icy and foreboding    after taking in their beauty   the eye seeks out the reassuring browns and greens   like a tired swimmer searching for the safety of land    the production works that way as well   it pulls you in initially as a crisp   thoroughly modern thriller   with clipped exchanges between defiantly non communicative characters    but the real draw of the film is the submerged humanity of two key players as   the deep end   gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy coating    spoiler alert   the following reveals the basic storyline    i believe the plot points are incidental   because the real rewards come in exploring the mindset of the main characters   but still   you should proceed at your own risk    with her husband tom   a naval officer   often away at sea   margaret hall   tilda swinton   holds down the fort   taking care of the children   beau   jonathan tucker     paige   tamara hope     and dylan   jordon dorrance     while her father in law jack   peter donat   hovers in the background   always watching    the story opens with margaret leaving the family home in lake tahoe to storm a male strip club in reno    it seems that beau   her eldest   is having an affair with darby reese   josh lucas     a disreputable sort 12 years his senior    margaret demands that darby leave her son alone   only to have the man smirk at her and announce he ll be glad to steer clear of beau   for $5000    back at home   she tries to talk about it all with her son   but the kid won t even confirm that he s gay   let alone discuss the issues she has with his boyfriend    he does   however   get attentive when she reveals darby s $5   000 offer   even as he maintains his sullen demeanor    late in the evening   darby shows up outside   tossing pebbles at beau s window like a schoolchild    the two meet by the water at the boathouse   where something important happens    i won t reveal what   suffice to say we become aware of a significant fact that margaret does not    all of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie   by the way    within a day or so   margaret s life becomes even more complicated when a suave man named alec goran visnjic   turns up with an explicit videotape documenting the sex life of beau and darby    he and his associate are willing to destroy the tape   once margaret coughs up $50   000    oh   what s a mother to do    end spoilers  written   directed and produced by scott mcgehee and david siegel     suture         the deep end   is based on elisabeth sanxay holding s 1940 s novel     the blank wall     which was also the source of the 1949 film     the reckless moment      i ve neither read the book nor seen the movie   but i understand that the filmmakers changed some details    in holding s story   the   scandalous   relationship is between an older man and margaret s teen age daughter    switching the gender makes the tale seem more contemporary   and it also raises questions about margaret s motives    many reviews of   the deep end   describe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son   but i wonder    consider this   margaret lives in a meticulously kept upscale home    her husband is absent most of the time and seems to be regarded as a larger than life figure    her father in law is constantly present   almost as if he is monitoring for his son    and when her husband does call   margaret is careful not to tell him about anything disturbing that is going on with the family    so is margaret a mother who accepts her son s sexual orientation and is simply trying to shield the young man from a lover she fears will take advantage of him    or is she caretaker of a museum of upper middle class complacency   desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything will be postcard perfect when the old man returns from the sea    you sort it out    regardless   the resonance of   the deep end   comes from two actors    goran visnjic   best known from the tv drama   er     is striking as a blackmailer unlike any you ve seen before    he engages margaret in a mesmerizing dance of protocol   chivalry and simmering eroticism    but the star of this show   without a doubt   is the remarkable tilda swinton    watch the shadings   depth   resource   vitality and understated sexuality she gives margaret and try to imagine the film without her    days after my second viewing of   the deep end     i can still vividly picture her negotiating with villains   trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue water       the deep end   is an exceptional film and tilda swinton is the best part of it    
Pos,    the end of the affair   is a dark and moody romantic period piece   that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs    although it s slow and sometimes confusing to follow   it still manages to give audiences a moving experience    based on graham greene s novel of the same name   the film mainly follows 3 characters    there s maurice bendrix   ralph fiennes   who has an affair with henry mile s   stephen rea   wife sarah   julianne moore      sarah finds henry to be a bore   because well   he s just a normal guy    it s all work and no play with him    while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah   and would do anything for her    unfortunately the two break up    this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks   so that leads us to the present    it s a few years later   and they both still think of each other   so maurice hires a private detective   ian hart   to see what sarah is up too    while this may sound straight forward it s not    it s a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men   unhappiness   and the ever lasting love    all this may sound like a drag   but it really captures your interest    with great performances by ralph fiennes   doing another english patient type of film   only this movie is better   and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999   i believe this was the role   she had the most passion for   and you can see why    the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan    even though i didn t read the book   there s no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive    what s so moving about it you ask    the tragedy of it all    it s not the typical romance   in which a guy finds a girl   they fall in love and all is well   this is more complicated and depressing    it really shows the complexity of a relationship   because nothing is ever perfect    everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces    back to neil jordan s script   it wasn t only red roses    there were times when i felt it too be a little slow   but most romances are    it also tended to be a bit confusing   especially at the start    it keep jumping around from past to present   so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things    also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan    i d have to say this is his finest achievement to date   because quite frankly i ve never really found his work to be up to par    it just never did anything for me   until now    when it ends   it leaves viewers a little saddened   but provoked nonetheless    this is definitely one of the best films of 99   and had some of the best acting   most notably by moore    not for all movie goers   but for those who are film buffs and want something of value

Neg, at first glance   i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise    its plotline goes like this   the evil king cromwell   desiring to take over the world   resurrects an evil   ancient sorceror   xusia for power    he attacks the kingdom of eh dan and kills young prince talon s parents    given a triple bladed sword   which can shoot bad guys   like a gun   by his dying father   talon vows for revenge    eleven years later   when he s established his own army   the mercaneries   he vows to take back his kingdom    along the way   he meets up with alana   whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell    talon vows to help   and   after a series of minor escapades   eventually ends up rescuing alana s brother   and several other prisoners     only to be captured himself   in other words   put on a cross to be crucified !      fortunately he frees himself   rescues alana from marrying cromwell   defeats xusia   and then cromwell   all with his triple bladed sword   during the final battle   the blade breaks   but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade      then   everything ends happily    unfortunately   the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds    what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping   bad acting   and gruesomely gory   bloody scenes    never once does the story seem to connect together   it just jumps around repeatedly    this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia    after telling him that he needs his help   he leads the warlock out into daylight   but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards    wait a minute   didn t the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh dan   which he cannot do by military force    if that is the case   why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him    and why does he manage to take over eh dan anyway    these questions are just never   no   never   answered in the film    another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life   another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana s wedding to cromwell   !     and finally at the end   instead of settling down with alana   he just tells her to   wait     and then he just rides off !  in addition to the extremely bloody scenes   this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure    even some attempts to make it exciting   a few fire scenes   battle scenes   don t work    it just completely fails altogether miserably    the only good thing about this film is its musical score   contributed by david whittaker   who had an   extremely   short music composing career    the score is boomy and adventurous   powerful   and a billion times better than this film is    my suggestion   steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead   if you can find it      ironically   though   before the film s credits roll   there is a message indicating that a sequel   tales of the ancient empire   would follow    to my relief   and delight     it never got into production   because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office   grossing only $39 million    critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer   all right    leonard maltin rightfully called it   second rate in scripting   and acting   and at a glance film reviews called it   a confusing   stupid   unimaginative   unengaging   bloodfilled bore      i totally agree with these reviews   all right   and i hope that this piece of #$% !  will be forgotten about    there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer    i hope you get a good laugh out of this review   but i am not laughing    in fact   my insults don t even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time    
Neg, before the remake of psycho appears   we ve got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film   dial m for murder    as usual   hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars   and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing    the film opens with emily   paltrow   and david   viggo mortensen    having fun  in an loft apartment    the problem is   paltrow is married to stephen   douglas     who is not too happy when he discovers this affair    if i was paltrow   though   i d definitely go with mortensen    less wrinkles    anyhow   stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition   he ll pay him to kill his lovely wife    mortensen agrees   but the murder goes awry   and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses    unfortunately   the film dosen t progress very fast    in fact   it moves like a tortoise with arthritis   read   very   very s l o w      the plot moves nowhere fast   and only becomes exciting in very short bursts    not too good for a  thriller      also   the performances   apart from douglas   are below par    paltrow   showing immense talent in se7en   1995   and sliding doors   1997   is strangely stilted   even unconvincing   in this movie    mortensen is a little bit better   coming across as a younger douglas   but his role isn t meaty enough to show all his talent    which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film   which is does    however   i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking   drinking womanizer with a creepy underside    also popping up in the film is david suchet   playing a shifty looking detective    again   it s not a character we re seeing on the screen   it s david suchet    the director   who bought us the fugitive   piles on all the flash techniques   such as zoom in s   quick cuts   etc   the lighting is also interesting    however   looks can t save this film from the depths of mediocre   and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway    the screenplay is o   k   but there s some hackneyed sub plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street   again   and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched    the characters also make incredibly dumb moves   especially paltrow   and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel    with a combination of no tension   drama   or decent characters   a perfect murder is a failure all round   and an incredible disappointment    there are a few bright moments   but they are far and few between    the last thing a thriller should be is boring   and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas   you wouldn t be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder    overall rating=  review by david wilcock   1998     you know   for kids     norville barnes  
Pos, david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director    with his distinctive   more often than not ingenious dialogue   and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible    some of them tend to be thickly layered   deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message   or sometimes even a concealed storyline    and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors   it is still a brilliantly complex   consistently riveting motion picture about honor   about sacrifice   and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right    oh   and it s rated g    incidentally   this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else s work   namely a play by terrence rattigan   set in the 19th century    he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow   a rich   aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note       did you do it     he asks his boy       no father   i didn t     ronnie answers    that s enough for arthur   who   with his oldest daughter   rebecca pidgeon     immediately starts a crusade to bring his son s case to court    they enlist the help of sir robert morton   a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task    it all seems fairly frivolous   and no matter how you look at it   the winslow case is not the trial of the century    but arthur is determined to keep his family s word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that    soon enough   sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings    so do we    all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue   but his style is still fairly apparent    the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense    but this is not mamet s norm   and it s refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks   gangsters as con men   wonderful as those films were    nigel hawthorne s performance is nearly flawless    his delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game    we pity the man   but we also like him    rebecca pidgeon   david mamet s wife   who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur s oldest daughter   a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the women s suffrage movement    the winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher    it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one    be honest   did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill    if you wanted to but didn t   this is a movie for you    it is the epitome of subtlety   it s powerful without being too emotional   sad without even trying to be depressing    david mamet can churn out some great scripts   but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too    he is almost a national treasure    his films deserve their own genre       1999 eugene novikov&#137

Pos, in     the muse   albert brooks plays steven phillips   a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio    they claim that he s lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them    he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over    so he turns to his   best   friend   jack   jeff bridges   another screenwriter who s enjoyed success after success    on the way over to jack s house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman   sharon stone   into a cab and begins to think   is he having an affair    when confronted   jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is   in fact   a muse   a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity   and has helped him garner his success       she doesn t do any actual writing     he is told     but inspires you      steven is excited by what he s hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if she ll take steven on as a new client    jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present   preferably something from tiffany s    after the meeting the muse   sarah decides to take on steven   but at a price   she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her   like bringing her salads in the middle of the night      steven s wife   andy macdowell   sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon    steven confesses everything and   although at first suspicious   she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life    the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he s going through for her    and that s a question only time will tell       the muse   is albert brooks  sixth film as writer/director/actor   he co wrote with monica johnson   and although it s a good movie it s not up to the level of his best works     defending your life   and   mother        the problem lies in the script   and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor   there aren t nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good one liners    it has a great premise but doesn t deliver up to it s full potential    but   i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit    he may whine and complain   but he just wants to support his family and be happy    and i like sharon stone in this movie too   it s a nice change of pace for her    and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner   james cameron and martin scorsese    and although   the muse   doesn t have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman s   the player   i still left the theater feeling good    and that s something i wish i got out of more movies    
Pos, in 1912   a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america    this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world   and she was    she was also build to be one of the most luxurious   and that she was    finally   she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not    to get a ticket for this voyage you either   spent a life s savings to get to america to start life anew   were part of the upper class and had the money to spare   or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson    jack dawson makes the trip   and happens to be at the right place at the right time    rose dewitt bukater   a first class passenger   climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping    thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue   and a tale of death and tragedy        this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago   an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia    the movie titanic shows what happened   maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy   but it still shows it very realisticaly    now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story    it serves as both admirably   brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating    this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is   but that alone is not enough    the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective    movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency    the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable    the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting   with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie    part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting   and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast    the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired    the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles    looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren t acting but are actually the characters in the movie    the casting for the movie could really have been better   in my humble opinion that is    one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself    yes   you read correctly   the ship is a character    how is the titanic a character    you ask well simple   a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you    this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this    mr   cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense    all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp    now   to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards    the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking    in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there   you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening   if your imagination is good      the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique    the movie will leave you amazed at the effects   and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie   just humans and an oversized ship    the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions   the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes    now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies   now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch   i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end    the historical value of this movie is quite high   and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy   for it is extremely well done    the method of telling the story is also good   maybe not totally unique but effective none the less    regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at    the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing    if you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! !  it might not be the best movie in the world      but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it    during none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie

Neg, jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today    from time to time   she blows away audiences with powerful   intense performances    on the other hand   this is the same woman who made her jaw droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis  king kong    and   much as lange would probably prefer movie goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume   every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it   if only in quality    hush is one such example    lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn t such a prime example of motion picture tedium    the film opens   as many so called   psychological thrillers   do   by posing as a light drama    we are introduced to jackson   johnathon schaech   last encounter in tom hanks  that thing you do !   and helen   gwyneth paltrow     a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love    jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother   martha   lange      the moment i first saw martha   i started looking for fangs    soon   the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant   this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm      once that goal is accomplished   she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives    as long as she gets her way   martha is a perfectly amicable person   but when helen defies her   it s a declaration of war    hush has three very simple problems   it s incredibly dumb   it s incredibly boring   and it s incredibly predictable   at least up to the stupefying ending      this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it   with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow s bare buttocks    frankly   it s embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange s stature give a performance like this    it s like a bad blanche dubois   the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire      meanwhile   paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines   and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object    as in all psychological thrillers   the battle lines are clearly drawn    here   it s mom and against wife   with jackson caught in the middle    of course   since schaech s character is poorly developed and badly acted   it s impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation    maybe someone should ask him if he s familiar with oedipus    martha is   of course   the evil one    how do we know she s evil    she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor    two sure signs that the devil is at work    on the other hand   helen is a good girl    the evidence for this is that she s nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents    that s about it for character development    beyond that point   hush is just a series of increasingly hard to swallow coincidences   contrivances   and moronic plot twists    however   the first 85 minutes are just a warm up for the ending   which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying    i can t imagine anyone   no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole   liking this conclusion    either there was some serious last minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script    before the climax   i disliked hush   by the time the end credits started   i hated it    viewers invest something in every movie they watch   no matter how good or bad it is    cheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable    most entries into this worn out   worm eaten genre aren t especially good    films like consenting adults   the hand that rocks the cradle   and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along    in general   however   they re directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension    that s not the case with really bad thrillers like this   which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation    the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care    indeed   the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid    
Pos, krippendorf s tribe is a formula comedy    done poorly   formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema    however   every now and then   one emerges   like krippendorf s tribe   that actually works    professor james krippendorf   richard dreyfuss     the renowned anthropologist   is in trouble    his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea    however   he found       nothing    his wife has recently died   and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids   shelly   natasha lyonne     mickey   gregory smith   and edmund   carl michael lidner      tonight   he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe    rather than break the news   and face the consequences of misusing his funds     he invents a tribe   the shelmikedmu   named after his kids      however   one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu   but his research becomes a popular phenomenon    soon   professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members    his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over eager colleague   veronica micelli   jenna elfman     and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist   ruth allen   lily tomlin      krippendorf s tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief    no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras   or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes    luckily   as the film builds momentum   that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by    though there s some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe   the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies    the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable   and the comic timing required for some of the film s latter scenes is superb    richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe    jenna elfman s position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times   but she plays the part with extreme affability    even the kids   who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side   are endearing and humorous    yes   the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor   but it has the best excuse of all   it s funny    it may not go down as an all time classic   but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy   plenty of laughs

Pos, my summer was recently saved by two very different movies    on opening night   i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron    then a few nights later   i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman s greenfingers even though it didn t feature a trip to band camp   girl on girl action   or seann william scott    however   i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers   which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs   clive owen of croupier      after spending roughly half of his life behind bars   he is transferred to a more lenient facility   edgefield    the picaresque   rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade   while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges    at first   briggs doesn t want to be there    he s used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone    however   his ailing roommate   fergus   david kelly of waking ned devine     wears briggs down through his benign nature    the two become friends   with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift    briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil   and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers    after the prison s governor   warren clarke   reprimands them   he s awed at what briggs has accomplished    and he s struck by an idea    briggs   fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prison s grounds    greenfingers   which is   inspired by actual events     becomes a bit like a sports movie after that    despite their differences   the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game    in this case a prestigious garden show    one renegade   in this case   briggs   will prove to have talent    of course   love will also rear its head   no   not   prison love        to hershman s credit   he doesn t pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs   like last year s lame marijuana comedy saving grace    i had to keep pinching myself when i didn t see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies   or the men giving high fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers    the movie deals with people and scores on that concept    it s wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again    give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting    his speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freeman s last stand in the shawshank redemption    owen s bedside scenes with kelly   who lends the film a human touch   are a marvel to behold   emotionally gripping without being sappy    written by hershman   greenfingers contains plenty of laughs    most come courtesy of helen mirren   who shines as the world class gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose   natasha little   when she starts dating briggs    the mother can t believe what he ll do if her daughter   burns the sunday roast      nothing is forced in greenfingers    the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines    primrose and briggs  relationship takes awkward steps    even when briggs decides to go back to edgefield   it s done for reasons of loyalty   not because the movie requires him to do so    after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like america s sweethearts and the princess dairies   it s an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well    
Pos, only a year after the initial release of   scream     the horror send up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre   the inevitable sequel   scream 2   has arrived in our theaters    while the tongue in cheek   parodic element is still noticeable in this film   it s really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story    the first film   while often violent and gruesome   was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant    the premise of   scream 2   is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called   stab     based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers   courtney cox   about the events in   scream     is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening    i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy    its conclusion   in which a bleeding   wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it s a publicity stunt   is more surreal and disturbing than anything else    the satire in   scream 2   thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general    although resident horror film geek randy   jamie kennedy   is back with fresh dialogue about sequels   and   interestingly enough   how they are usually inferior to their predecessors     the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well    everything from   friends   and   saved by the bell   to   showgirls   and   terminator 2   is referenced here   horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning   and there aren t any   wes carpenter   jokes this time    more importantly   this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film    the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from   scream     in fact   the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense     weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety   and one man seems willing to save the heroine s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show    understandably     scream 2   does not go so far as to actually blame the movies   but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted    couple that with the fact that several of the characters   most notably the lead character sidney prescott   neve campbell     are fairly well developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine chilling suspense   and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right    we don t just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore   we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered   and   in one case   a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust   and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner    while i have not seen any of his other work   it s easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated   slasher film   director   as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing    unfortunately     scream 2   occasionally reverts to the time honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window    for example   several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later   there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick   but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion    there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that   s   he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction    as for the question of whether or not   scream 2   is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor            well   it s hard to say    i gave the first   scream   3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light hearted send up       scream 2   bounces all over the place stylistically   but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment    i m not sure which is the better movie   but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing   sequels   however much randy might argue   do not necessarily suck    
Neg, starring arnold schwarzenegger   danny devito   emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment   and a big one at that    junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman    these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins    so foolish me   i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins    so much for hopes    schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists   doctors hesse and arbogast   who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy    unfortunately   due to circumstances beyond their control   they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans   and subsequently lose their funding    still believing that their drug will work   they decide to test it anyway   on hesse    so   dr   hesse   schwarzenegger   artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug    their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying   surely it will work on a woman    does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you    well   it must have to the producers of junior    admittedly   schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off    perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny    but it wasn t   schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best    the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy   and the accompanying emotional swings   is not funny    schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics    i kept thinking to myself   with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture    better yet   with schwarzenegger   devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time   why didn t they make a sequel to twins    anything would have been better than this mess    danny devito is wasted in this movie    his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street       after seeing the movie   if i was devito   i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street      emma thompson is wasted here as well    while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations   she is also a fine comedian    too bad she didn t get to use any of that talent here    am i being too hard on this film    i don t think so    schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today   and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood    with a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella   the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film    they certainly managed here    maybe it was well intentioned   but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made    if you are tempted to see this film   do yourself a favor and go rent twins   a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito s comedic talents    
Neg, steve martin shines but sgt   bilko  fails to impress  based on the popular 50 s sitcom   sgt    bilko follows the string of old sitcoms to movie conversion fever    remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back       brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped      i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy   but the tv conversion movies are hitting our screens like wildfire   sad to say   with mixed success    such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following   the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie    sgt    bilko   frankly   i have not seen any its original tv version     even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd   failed to entertain    sgt   ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool   place of vehicle storage and repair   of fort baxter    though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of   he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money making opportunities   from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4 d pools    though materialistic in mind   bilko s methods has thoughtfully `enriched  the lives of the men of fort baxter   providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that    colonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn `blissfully confused  state   bilko has managed to hide his operation   though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it    bilko s state of ascent is suddenly under fire when the pentagon sends major thorn   a tough cookie on army regulations   to check on the progress on the $70 million hovertank project   a new weapon under development within the fort s grounds    to add to his problems   thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major `sabo  done on him by bilko during their younger army days    director jonathan lynn   who directed my cousin vinny   in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best supporting actress   managed to pull sgt    bilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter   but that is about it    there are really not enough laughter packed moments in sgt    bilko to fully entertain the average movie goer    still   steve martin s sgt    bilko is played with finesse and full force by the renowned comedian    without him   sgt    bilko would have just fell flat on its face    sgt    bilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world    the current trend in mixed successes in such tv conversions may be a blessing in disguise   really   at least it will force hollywood to re think any of its initial intentions to turn another tv idea into a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity    unless you are a fan of the tv series or love to watch steve martin in action   you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres    i m sure there are better ones around

Neg, the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission    he attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth   but misses    after they ricochet off his face   he says     not a good start      as it turns out   this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence   but to the rest of the movie as well    in this   the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong   chan plays an international operative codenamed   condor     and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazi s during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war    for some reason   condor is given his mission at the u   s   embassy in spain    i think this may have been done so that in a chase scene   they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart    watch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country   most notably in europe    the chase will take itself through a marketplace   and a fruit cart will be overturned    it s almost a guarantee    anyway          condor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden   the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it   which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly    to help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly   condor is accompanied by a desert expert   carol cheng   and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold   eva cobo      there aren t supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain   but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something    although these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission   they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts    in fact   most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight    i suppose this isn t so bad   since chan s action is really the best part of the movie   and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway    if you ve never seen a jackie chan movie   don t expect a great plot   but do expect to be entertained by his moves    they are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human    knowing that he does his own stunts   and knowing that this is the real stuff   no computer masked bungee cords here   makes the action sequences all the more exciting    you ve got to hand it to a guy who s probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art    also of note in this   as in any jackie chan movie   is the humor    as far as i know   none of his films take themselves too seriously   and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongue in cheek quality about them    what is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes    unlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme   where the fights get you on the visceral level   fight scenes in chan s movies are simply entertaining    you marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh    unfortunately   even chan s mastery can t save this film    the plot and characters are so weak that they don t hold the movie together at all   and the acting is terrible    carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past   but since operation condor is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off    this   combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying    
Neg, they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movie s poster     no sequel      scary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor   and it is not because the wayans brothers   shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera   don t try    what defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof    the first movie   an outrageous   low brow   savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer   succeeded because of its take no prisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue   familiar and popular    in scary movie 2   the filmmakers take on the haunted house ghost story format which   if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill   did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series    scary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist   featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn    of course split pea soup is the punch line   an overabundant amount   which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive    but this pre credit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action   which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project    some of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original   but they lack that take no prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque    scary movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another   offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball   and the films what lies beneath and hannibal   features that only faired adequately at the box office     john woo s mission   impossible 2 and charlie s angels    it is as if the wayans and their team of writers   at least seven are credited   just threw ideas in a blender and hoped they d coalesce    they don t    while the pace of the original left you breathless   the sequel moves with the speed of an 18 wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road    you can almost hear the reels panting    scary movie 2 tries very hard to live up to its original   but it falls very short    it s a dissatisfying spectacle   a very weak sister of a very good movie    the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is    
Neg, well   here s a distasteful   thoroughly amateurish item that   surprisingly   was actually a box office hit at the time of its release    after just viewing the film for the first time   my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie    it is cheap   idiotic   unfunny   and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was    at least some smut would have livened things up a bit       porky s     tells the story   if you can call it that   of four clueless high school buddies   pee wee   dan monahan     billy   mark herrier     tommy   wyatt knight     and mickey   roger wilson     whom desperately want to get laid    women   for the most part   are a mystery to them   and in this movie   they are to the audience   as well   since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet      their plan is sidetracked   however   when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porky s   which they are able to get into using fake id s    after they pay the manager one hundred bucks for three hookers   they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building    for these four teenage guys   this means war on porky s       porky s     ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level    as a teenage sex romp   it is not wild or amusing enough    as a comedy   all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat    as a look back at the 1950 s   it is something   i suspect   most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave    and as a revenge movie   it is a crushing bore    one of the most offensive things about     porky s     is how jaw droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers    the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters   and we learn very little about them   except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool    that sure is revealing information    the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark    the women are all treated as objects or comedy props   rather than real people    for example   the two gym teachers   mrs   balbricker   nancy parsons   and honeywell   kim cattrall     only have one purpose   and that is to be made fun of    mrs   balbricker is a gruff   no holds barred   overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness   and   in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved   honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog    there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses   even though i have the suspicion they are not     but one thing is for sure   they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny   only humiliating    to prove how out of touch this so called comedy is   compare it to other more serious 80 s films about teenagers   and it looks even worse in comaprison    any of the john hughes pictures   such as 1984 s   sixteen candles     or   1985 s   the breakfast club     put     porky s     at an even greater shame    those films actually dealt with serious teen matters   but remained a great deal funnier   thanks to their bright and truthful writing    and heck   if     porky s     wanted to be a teenage sex movie   i d take 1982 s   fast times at ridgemont high     or 1982 s   the last american virgin     over this any day of the week    director bob clark is not a bad director    two years after he made     porky s     he directed the nostalgic holiday classic     a christmas story      i would forgive him for this misfire   in fact   if it wasn t for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay    just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage   and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world   is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in     porky s      
Pos,  contact  shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses    see contact with your family    it is a movie for all ages      a review by stuart cracraft  contact starring   jodie foster   matthew mcconaughey   john hurt director   robert zemeckis star  after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers of 10 zoom out start   which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof   morrison s work     contact picks up steam   gradually   building   by the end   an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out of balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological   geek   side    by the end   the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do   evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what s out there    this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high tech movies    however   except for jodie foster   elie arroway   and john hurt   s   r    hadden     who are both actors of exceptional caliber   the supporting cast are not especially impressive    hurt certainly has had better roles   stephen ward in scandal      this one   as the multi billionare hadden   does not do his acting skills justice    this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation    foster s radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms    early scenes take a long   long time to build up to this    the movie s pacing is very good and subtle    the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful    the politics of foster s character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however    one of the most entertaining   but very short scenes   is when foster is confronted by rob lowe   during a cabinet level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation    there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored    it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters    everything else was very one sided   e   g    foster      lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table    the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far away world in the starsystem of vega    it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley s scenes in his book steel beach   where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence   in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself   and in foster s case   an illusion drawn from her memory    in another sense   this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry s star trek pilot the cage   later the menagerie   when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens    the concept is not new   by any sense   in the world of science fiction    but the beach scene   which is the centerpiece of the film   as is the whole film   is driven by foster    freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki   foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast    as the movie gains speed   foster s acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her    it is certainly oscar caliber acting   unquestionably    the supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos   cleverly manipulated   george stephanopolus style   to seem very forrest gump    in fact   zemeckis et    al    got in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie   vis a vis clinton    but the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton s walk ons    the much discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not    also   the near final scene   in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing    contact is a fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan   science popularizer   and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academe    perhaps now   sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden    
Neg, a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent   but one with no edge to it    it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich   s and stock characters of this genre    though it s a well written and well acted fluff piece   it still does not have too much to say that is surprising    it s made for the gentle art house set   those who don t want something too disturbing to think about    it s about a critically successful writer husband   alec   pryce     who is so self absorbed that he s threatened by his department store floor walking model wife   kate   bouquet     who wants to be a writer    she meets his crass publisher   vanni corso   walken     another self absorbed man   and a predictable relationship occurs    the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband s first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet    she now wants her own identity and her independence    the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff   and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie    the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium   and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax    it s set in london   and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper   vanni    she later meets him as her hubby s new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality   and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel    alec who is an obnoxious grouse   someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with   tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published  which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni    the publisher is proud that he s a mamma s boy who never married and is a self made man who has earned millions    he has recently acquired a failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it   as he proudly tells kate     if my father could sell pizzas in harlem   i could sell culture in europe      the only thing that couldn t be sold   is this stiff story and tired plot line    the mystery to me   is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy    she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon to become beleaguered vanni    when she writes a second novel   he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did    it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one   as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper    a business affair was loosely based on the real life literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly   in their celebrated 1950s love triangle

Neg, an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer    you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage   which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it s hollywood existence    when i think of the screenwriters behind this film   i picture a room full of monkeys    the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves    all of the monkeys combine their efforts   hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark s office    the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark s desk while flailing his arms and shrieking    the director appears to be deep in thought   until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it ! ! !    the writing behind this project is embarrassing    for your amusement   i will explain the plot    dr   kinder   kathleen turner   and dr   heep   christopher lloyd   are two of the cold hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute   where peculiar studies are going on    as the story goes   there is an ancient myth explaining that babies   ages 2 and under   know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences    when they move past this phase   they become like any other drooling toddler    kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies   namely little sylvester   sly for short     who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission   impossible team    there is so much crap derived from this premise   despite the fact it s virtually identical to the plot in look who s talking !     a far superior film in any league      you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene    sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung fu tactics    question   it s obvious the babies are super smart   but why are they able to fight like jackie chan      the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers    it s a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes  familiar home alone formula    i also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90 s knowledge   quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors    the effects in baby geniuses   similar to the talking animals in babe   are pathetic   the editing is a disaster   and the jokes are never funny    the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute     i suppose they are    i can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute    other instances   though   i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script    there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever   their entire existence is based on punch lines    peter macnicol and kim cattrall   as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester s twin   are both miscast    then again   i don t suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid    meanwhile   dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench   hahaha      i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs    instead of watching this   i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling    or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark infested waters    anything to avoid this painful movie    the final line in the film   spoken by the bratty sylvester   is `if they think i m doing the sequel for less than $20 mill   they re nuts     sequel    please have mercy    
Neg, even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material   as this subpar submarine comedy proves    down periscope stars kelsey   frasier   grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer s   james coburn   plan to get him out of the navy    like any lame emsemble comedy   the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out   the fat guy who eats all the time   the beautiful woman who doesn t belong there   lauren holly     the second in command who does everything by the book   rob schneider     the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out   harry dean stanton   and so on    then comes the transparent plotline    first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him   and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard    after the ship is fixed up come the early drills   where everyone seems completely inept   like the electrician who can t connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone    finally   and this covers the final hour of the movie   grammer has to lead his men   and holly   to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise    and he has to be a clever rebel to do it   in scenes that stretch all levels of believability    first they re singing   louie louie   like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off   then thirty minutes later   they re making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off    the whole while   evil captain coburn is overacting underwater   cursing grammer   as most people watching the movie probably are too      it s all predictable without any original humor to redeem it    the jokes are right out of   mchale s navy   and other cut rate sitcoms of the past    there s one scene where schneider looks through the ship s pantry in disgust   holds one food can up and announces     this expired in 1966 !    i yelled back at the screen     so did these jokes      i watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it    my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and   around the start of the second hour   i started writing my will    the blame can t really be placed on the stars   though    kelsey grammer is good in this   he just doesn t have anything to work with    his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had   welcome aboard   tatooed on his penis    grammer probably did something even worse    got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about    same for holley   save the penis part     who is likeable in down periscope just because she s so gorgeous    as for schneider   whose character is downright annoying     there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas   although he s still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the   snl   ship    my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy     okay   it s police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber       and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster    judging from the video box   most other movie critics agree with me    the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel s jim ferguson    i guess even jeff craig from   60 second preview     who said tank girl   kicks butt !    without ever seeing it   didn t like this    
Neg, for a good ten years or so   super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene    now   he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo     who launched chow s super stardom in the acclaimed  a better tomorrow    by moving to hollywood    i had some reservations about this move and it would seem i was right to have them    chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt    his final job requires him to kill a policeman s seven year old boy    this he refuses do and runs    however   he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job    cue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot  outs which take place in various locations    some thought had gone into making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring    the car wash scene   i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked    tut tut    the emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music     i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie   and not on the content    mia sorvino   a passport forger   is dragged into the affay and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a gun    director antoine arqua has clearly not observed chow s excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots    chow s trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale   which in fairness is quite good   and there s not even a toothpick in site    and as for making chow shoot like a cop   well that s damned unforgiveable    to round up   the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for chow    it would appear he has left asia for a 90 minute pop video    this is not what we wanted at all   considering john woo was the exec producer       did he have no say so at all      watch  the killer  again and weep at the difference    review by chris hill       there s room at the top   they are telling you still   but first you must learn how to smile as you kill   if you want to be like the folks on the hill      
Neg, i suppose it s unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk   which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it s 1991 release    michael lehmann s action comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time    or close thereof    the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk   who s just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation   `let me put it this way     he explains   `i never saw et       greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime   played by danny aiello     who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes    these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags   cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences    it appears as if director lehmann didn t know when to stop all the absurd silliness   and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line    if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn t get goofier   you ll soon be eating your words    but   i m inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it s box office numbers suggest    it s fast paced and entertaining   if you ve got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor    for the first portion of this review   i m going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk    wish me luck    first and foremost   bruce willis is a good sport    while i m not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co wrote this script   willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big   fat   ugly joke    he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out of place   which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions    another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character    they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican   and their relationship escalates in interest from there    it s unfortunate that mcdowell s one note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot twist   and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis    but now i m rambling on again about the negative things   aren t i    enough of the charade   for the most part   hudson hawk is an excruciating experience    it s stupid   pointless and repetitive    i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater   because this film really doesn t have the potential to please anyone    action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy   and even the action sequences are skittery   rushed and poorly edited    and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache inducing hi jinks    don t get me wrong   this film is not devoid of laughs    it s too bad most of them are unintentional   or just plain forced    the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed    it s understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber   but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i m not entirely sure    coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play   and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie    especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown   and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film    things get more bizarre when we re introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars   including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless   card flipping kit kat    if that s not enough for you   there s richard e   grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover    their crotch biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here    wait   maybe the only big laughs        i m not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk    i can t even begin to start about the film s absurd plot   but let s not get into that    i suppose there s some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise   if they were that desperate    but hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it s going from minute one   and from there it s 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck    
Pos, i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean s war picture    i still think that it doesn t deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute s list of the 100 greatest american movies    and i think that lumet s   12 angry men     wilder s   witness for the prosecution   and kubrick s   paths of glory   would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958    but i can t deny the importance of   the bridge on the river kwai     cinematically and in its contents    the film is set in burma in 1943    a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai    but the british commanding officer   colonel nicholson   alec guinness     insists   corresponding to the geneva conventions   that his officers needn t work as simple workmen    struggling toughly   col   nicholson forces the japanese commandant   col   saito   sessue hayakawa     to give way in this respect    afterwards col   nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge    he considers it an opportunity to raise his men s morale   and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese    but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge   among them the american shears   william holden     an escapee from the japanese prison camp   and the british major warden   jack hawkins          a flaw of the picture is the clich   d characterization of the japanese people    they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british   as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge    and the film doesn t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in   paths of glory      lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies    this is also perceptible in the conversations between col   nicholson and col   saito    in this regard it is symptomatic that shears   who doubts the military logic   is a somehow unpleasant person in the film    the audience is supposed to applaud col   nicholson s perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not    the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col   nicholson takes for his men       the plot by passes these risks      that means   the picture isn t perfect    but it has a lot of virtues as well    it shows the   madness   of war and what war can produce in people s minds    it shows how col   nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others   like shears   get cynics    and   the bridge on the river kwai   is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests    these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti war film   despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme      david lean s effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense   especially in the dramatic   though not wholly plausible   showdown    alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col   nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character    the other actors deliver very good performances as well    jack hildyard s fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful    i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses       c   karl rackwitz   klein k   ris   germany   1999    
Pos, in my review of there s something about mary   i said something to the effect of   laughter isn t everything      i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate   laughter isn t everything   unless i m watching a jim abrahams film    see   spoofs are easy with me    i love movies   and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love    sometimes i m the only one in the theater laughing    sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high pitched in comparison to my speaking voice   it cuts right through everyone else s laughter      sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film    abraham s latest film   mafia !   induced this kind of hysteria upon me    it s gotten some mediocre reviews   but   hey   i m the guy who laughs at everything    there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film   but there are far more that work   and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness    i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought provoking    most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things   like develop characters   shape stories   and other such nonsense    mafia !  has no pretentions about characters or story   and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh    the film begins on the perfect high note   with a mockery of the opening of casino    our hero   jay mohr   is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car   which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire    to describe the story of mafia !  is absurd and pointless   but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films   with a lot of casino references inserted throughout    along the way   the parodies seem arbitrary   and rarely victimize mob films   pictures like the english patient   forrest gump   and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing    movies like this rely on just a few things   but the most important element is direction    abrahams has been down this path many times before   hot shots !   top secret !   airplane !   and any other film with an exclamation point in the title     and so i hold most of the success of mafia !  to his experience    he takes just the right attitude in each scene   and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references   one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic   but it never develops      the actors are all energetic   which helps a lot with the tone of the film    mohr   suicide kings   paulie     who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors   is so good here    he looks like he s having so much fun that he s containing his laughter in every scene   watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool      he s probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material    lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando s godfather   while pamela gidley is dead on in a full blown mockery of sharon stone    the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i m supposed to give examples of things and be specific    unfortunately   i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia !  that i can t remember a lot of what made me laugh    but that s a good sign   mafia !  is so funny that i wasn t even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory    i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain    i know that doesn t sound particularly complimentary   but when watching a dumb comedy like this   the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain    finally   a film that does this for me    
Neg, in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa    the twilight murders   another one from the series   is dealing with the case of gordon kahl   played by rod steiger     old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u   s   government    after being released   he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest    when the u   s   marshals come to arrest him   it turns out that kahl isn t alone    many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti government beliefs   and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that    that brings fbi on the scene   and agent mayberly   michael gross   is supervising the manhunt    however   his efforts seem fruitless   since kahl still has many supporters   some of them even in the local law enforcement    after betrayed   1988 thriller by costa gavras   hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right wing extremism in the american northwest   and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing   when media hype brought right wingers back into spotlight    until that time   only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon    unfortunately   the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film   that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script    sometimes   like many american tv movies   it creates drama where drama shouldn t be    on the other hand   film is steadily directed by dick lowry   and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl    on the other hand   michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible    however   film does deal with potentially thought provoking social and political issues   so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn t be the total waste of time    
Pos, kevin smith is like a big kid    his humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile s    he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books   having also written a few    he also has a cult following   mostly composed of teenagers   college students   and smith s own fellow adolescent minded grownups    smith is hilarious in person and in writing   but when he tries to be earnest and moralize   that is when he goes wrong    kevin smith is a better writer than director   and he ll be the first to tell you that    that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy handed    great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them    this was true in the overrated chasing amy   and it is true for dogma as well    that is not to say smith s message is a bad one    in dogma   smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god s desires is superior to anyone else s    basically   dogmatism is bad    changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible   and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight   they also know what is best for you   whether you like it or not    this is not exactly a new message in movies   see inherit the wind     but i have no problems with recycling old ones   particularly since dogma s protesters are proving smith s point    smith s own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book    but this is smith s personality   and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible   or koran   etc     correctly   or if there even is a correctly   and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns    the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany   linda fiorentino   being chosen by voice of god   metatron   alan rickman     to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels   bartleby   ben affleck   and angel of death   loki   matt damon      along the way   forgotten thirteenth apostle   rufus   chris rock     stripper muse serendipity   salma hayek     and slacker duo jay and silent bob   jason mewes and kevin smith himself   come to bethany s aid    fallen muse   azrael   jason lee     proves to be the behind the scenes manipulator for all the chicanery    the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith s points   and in itself   has little dramatic momentum    among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman   jesus was black   and the bible was written by a bunch of racist   misogynistic white men    of course   kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself    they are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic    smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie    when harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes   smith thought it might give validation to protesters  claims that the film was sacrilegious   but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke    the film s humor is uneven    some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning bush kind of entrance    but many of the film s jokes just bomb   as in virtually anything involving salma hayek s serendipity    also   some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away    still   smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace    among the actors   fiorentino and rickman stand out by far    fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight    damon and affleck are fairly lackluster    rock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith    but the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob   who recur in all of smith s movies   are much more in line with smith s brand of humor    bud cort   george carlin   janeane garofalo   guinevere turner   and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances    
Pos, one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length    if a film is only 90 minutes   but feels like 300 minutes   then it s crap    but if a film last 2 1/2 hours   and feels like 90 minutes   then it s excellent    boogie nights falls into the latter catagory    the director   anderson   delivers a funny   hip   yet sometimes violent film   which flies along    mark whalberg   a   k   a  marky mark   plays eddie adams   a seventeen year old with a certain  gift  in the midriff area    jack horner   reynolds   is a adult film director   who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business    after running away from home   eddie joins jack   changes his name to dirk diggler   and starts making erotic movies    in the movie business   dirk meets a whole load of characters   which the film introduces very quickly and slickly   such as scotty   phillip seymour hoffman     rollergirl   graham   amber   moore   and floyd   phillip baker hall     and little bill   william h   macy   all the characters are well written   well played   and the audience gets to know them pretty well   thanks to the excellent script    we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce   rollergirls hard time at school   and little bills wife   who sleeps with everyone except her husband    but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing    the direction is fast   thrilling   and never holds up    there are some great shots   some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences   and lots of other neat directional touches    the writing is fabulous   with some intelligent dialogue   some funny dialogue   but none of the dialogue is crap   like most hollywood films   such as the lost world   jurassic park   1997     or tommorow never dies   1997        boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing   on par   and sometimes betters   quentin tarantino s films resevoir dogs   1992   and pulp fiction   1994    the soundtrack is also excellent    like american graffiti   1973     the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack   which heightens the atmosphere   and gives the film an extra lift    also   the costumes are great    the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties    the film   although excellent   does have some flaws    firstly   wahlberg   although excellent   cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry    in both scenes where he has to act angry   his acting is so  off    the scenes tension and anger is lost    but the rest of the cast are excellent    burt reynolds is brilliant   julianne moore shows real emotion   and william h   macy is great aswell   but he always is      another flaw with the film   though   is that the ending seems a bit tacked on    it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit   and needed to wrap up quickly    it s a shame   really   as the rest of the film is perfectly paced    but they re small niggles really    boogie nights is an excellent film    superb directing   writing   acting and music   all combine to make one spectacular film    whatever you do   do not miss out on boogie nights    
Pos, richard gere is not one of my favorite actors    however   i like courtroom dramas   and this film looked good enough to take a chance on    i wasn t disappointed    it wasn t a great film   but it was interesting   and took several unexpected turns    one thing   what s with the title    not only is it extremely forgettable   it doesn t really have much to do with the film   as far as i could determine    in the long run   it will probably hurt the film   as people won t be able to think of or remember it    martin vail   richard gere   is a grandiose defense attorney    he loves the money and the fame that go along with defending   successfully   rich scum   such as mafia men and drug dealers    once he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby faced alter boy   he wants in on the case   presumably for the press he ll get    we soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover   janet venable   laura linney      vail himself is a former prosecutor   and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney   played very well by john mahoney   frasier s father on the tv series      there is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie   people have public faces   and private faces    we see this in the murdered archbishop   in the accused   and   most strongly   defense attorney martin vail    richard gere does a fairly good job    at first   he appears to be a money  and attention grabbing lawyer   with no consideration of the truth    but we see another side   as he becomes a seeker of justice   and comes to believe in his client    alfre woodard   as the judge   is capable   though somewhat wasted in a standard role    laura linney also does journeyman work   nothing spectacular   but acceptable    her relationship with vail is believable   their verbal fencing adds to the film    the actor who playes vail s investigator   unfortunately   i don t remember his name   is quite good    his female assistant   she looked very familiar   but i can t remember where i ve seen her   was also capable   but unspectacular    the best performance in the film was by edward norton    he was excellent   as the timid altar boy turned alleged   butcher boy of st   mike s      i was impressed by the depth of the plot   there are red herrings   and dead ends   that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending    i liked the plot twists the film took   and most of the supporting characters   thus i give primal fear a respectable b+ rating

Neg, the film may be called mercury rising   but that title doesn t describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture   a routine thriller that combines government cover ups with a cloying and poorly motivated buddy story    the   hook   that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic    however   aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance   this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device    those expecting to see even a semi thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed    mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism    the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard  to swallow    i don t know whether the problem is in the original book   simple simon   or in the screenplay adaptation   but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible    once again   certain standby plot elements    the high level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent    are recycled   and not to good effect    while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood   this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense    the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold   art jeffries   bruce willis     is confronted with his own failure    unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time   he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death    the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9 year old simon lynch   miko hughes   when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player    soon   art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone    fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time   with the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player always just a step behind them    along the way   they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy   chi mcbride   and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest   kim dickens      why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player    apparently   the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra secret code called   mercury      to make sure it can t be cracked   they do the most intuitive thing possible   place a sample of it in a   nerds  puzzle magazine      of course   no one can solve it    no one except autistic simon   that is    when he calls the phone number listed in the solution   he gets the nsa    as a result   the cold hearted   sneering government man   alec baldwin   decides that simon has to be eliminated    for the good of the country   of course    but he hasn t counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold   even though everyone in the audience has    it s hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn t do anything exceptionally well   and does quite a few things rather poorly    for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like   mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time to time   but even the most exciting scenes   such as the one where art and simon are crouched down   avoiding passing trains   aren t that pulse pounding    the climactic struggle is a real ho hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness    overall   director harold becker is constantly struggling   and failing   to generate even a moment that isn t derivative or obligatory    bruce willis  star seems to be fading    this is his fourth straight lackluster outing   following last man standing   the fifth element   and the jackal    willis isn t terrible   but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through   and often does    alec baldwin   combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice   does some scenery  chewing   but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace    the film s real star is young miko hughes   heather langenkamp s son in wes craven s new nightmare     who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual   but is about 50 years younger    mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain   the replacement killers   and u   s   marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers    for those who like action and adventure in the theater   this has not been a good year    hopefully   the advent of summer will change that    until then   the best choices   for bruce willis or any other action hero   are on video    and   if you re determined to see mercury rising   check out the morning sky in early may    
Neg, the plot of big momma s house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress    that s not just the high concept premise   it s the fully realized   all encompassing plot    such an emphasis is not unheard of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment    one need merely look back to last summer   when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent    the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high concept plot idea better be pretty well realized   or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer   because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time    not a developed character   not a provocative theme   not a witty twist    you will get 90 plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress    nothing more   nothing less    those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one note dud that is big momma s house    others will simply stare   mouth agape   at its sheer unapologetic laziness    lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner   an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john   paul giamatti      dangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco   terrence howard   has escaped from prison   and the feds think he s headed for his former girlfriend and presumed but never proved accomplice sherry   nia long      sherry   however   has fled with her son trent   jascha washington     possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae   ella mitchell     better known as big momma    indeed   sherry appears to be on her way   but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming    that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows    big momma s house s bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs    doubtfire    director raja gosnell edited that film   and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom    but there s just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character s attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman    unfortunately   big momma s house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made   instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses   it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters    suspension of disbelief in big momma s house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid   since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other    of course   laughs trumps logic every time   and big momma s house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny    and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul tempered beast   while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry    unfortunately   no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another   very different real person   so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags   malcolm reacting violently to big momma s explosive diarrhea attack   malcolm as momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball   malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments   malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife   one of the few sequences that works      martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times   but there s no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character    he s just big momma without the makeup on    i won t waste time commenting on how ineptly the set up of the escaped convict is employed   since it was clearly a waste of time to the film makers    there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure   but he s ultimately a distraction in a film that s really about its central visual incongruity   and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long s posterior      i m never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people    several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing    but i know that when a film maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it s an entire film   i duck out of the way    the gross implausibility of big momma s house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big   cleverly constructed laughs    its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant    big momma s house is ridiculous  and  not funny    it s just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress    
Pos, the truman show   paramount pictures   running time   1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait   jim carrey s dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen    in case you ve been asleep for the last few months   the plot centres on truman burbank   carrey   who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven    his life seems so perfect   however   because it s controlled by christoff   harris   creator of the truman show   the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of    that s right   burbank s life is being broadcast live to the american public   and seahaven and all it s inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage    the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far        with an idea so different   it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator    luckily   the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages   yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie    talking of carrey   he s perfect in this movie   enjoying the best role in his career    his character is a re inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask   1994   and is completely suited to carrey s persona    he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode   shrieking and being silly   but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey    he s not completely dramatic like the film promises   however    ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff   the megalomaniac creator of the show    quiet and well spoken   he burns an image into the viewer    unfortunately   he s barely in the film   and for the first hour dosen t appear at all !  also disappointing is natascha mcelhone s character sylvia    she plays the role well   but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her    the supporting cast is excellent   and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect   so perfect it s creepy    the philip glass soundtrack is also superb   and is used to great effect during the film    peter weir keeps the film going   clearly having fun    the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card    although it is slightly slow to begin with   about half an hour into film the pace really picks up   and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll    sadly   though   the film is practically over when the film is in full steam    also   concerning the ending   it is slightly too ambiguous   which was disappointing    the screenwriter   andrew niccol   who bought us gattaca   1997   delivers an entertaining script   and manages to keep the plot in trim    while christoff s plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly   they never go over the line   which would have been easy for niccol to do    also   there s some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show    overall   the truman show is excellent entertainment    certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces   it should be viewed by everyone    it offers something to every member of the audience   and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed    overall rating=  review by david wilcock   1998     you know   for kids     norville barnes  
Neg, this well conceived but ultra sugary coming of age film is not for everyone   and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion    joseph cross   joshua beal   is a 10 year old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather   loggia   to bone marrow cancer    loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner   it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup    the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family   where everyone is just so nice and affluent   and properly religious without being fanatical    the beals   the father   denis leary   and his wife   dana delany     are both successful doctors   julia stiles plays joshua s older sister   needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him    this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven   but living in south philadelphia   sending their children to a well run catholic school    joshua   the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn   is a handsome   sweet   intelligent   friendly   and endearing child   who does well in school   relates to the nuns and priests   and talks politely to his well meaning parents    all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch    the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather   who promised to be with him forever    his answer is to search for god   pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do   but that s just the way it is   sometimes    this search for god takes us nowhere because   as his friend david   reifsnyder   says   where can you look for him if he doesn t exist    now   that s a smart kid    but joseph looks for him in the usual places   and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends    one of his teachers is the kind hearted sister terry   rosie o donnell     who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball   making him the clean up hitter   and in my opinion   if she wasn t a big tv star   would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher   she is that convincing    throughout the film   she is saved from answering any tough   sic !    question about god by the bell   as it rings to end the class    nothing much happens in the search for god   there is no parody of the catholic school   though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god   but this is gentle stuff   no real criticism or search for god is attempted    what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum   which is designed not to upset anyone   as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real   live angel   a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody goody    the film ends as this angel   ! ! !    tells him his grandfather is all right    his quest is ended   as apparently angels don t have wings and are approachable   and god   well          maybe that s for another film down the road    this part of the film was the final straw for me   i couldn t swallow any more goo    as this film flopped commercially   his next one   the sixth sense   pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose    though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts   this director is loaded with hokum   all he has learned how to do   is hide the hokum better    well   god bless him   if he can do that    this is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood    it s just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death   children in a parochial elementary school   or for that matter   about god    and that family of his   they re too good for words    yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place    for those who want to see something soft   without a bite to it   this is the one    
Neg,    book   should have remained in shadows  book of shadows   blair witch 2  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  certain things in our lives are inevitable    death   sorrow   love   heartbreak   pain   joy    we expect these events    we know they re going to happen and some   we even look forward to    it s part of the human condition    we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society    as we near the fall election   several of them are hitting us in the face    politicians exaggerate their own importance    our side is always right   theirs is always wrong    in the end   voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares    in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money   there will be a sequel    even if the original story doesn t merit one    even if the first film is complete in itself    even if success is a fluke       the blair witch project   was made with a budget of $1   75 and exploded on the screen   raking in huge profits    the concept was brilliant    the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real    the film itself was even more convincing    the movie  must  be authentic    why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen    the first film caught lightning in a bottle    the sequel proves you can t pour that old lightning into a new bottle    you have to give this effort some credit    it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids    it would have been easy   but of course   it wouldn t have worked    instead   book of shadows   acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release    it s a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel    unfortunately it doesn t work either    five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film    weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives    even weirder stuff happens    some people die   there s blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense    while supposedly doing serious research   the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation    then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud   very obnoxious heavy metal music    it s a bad plan    the cast shows some early promise    a couple is doing research on a   blair witch   book    the tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficionado    a goth amazon princess adds a bit of comedic relief    the obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick   the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick   the cute wiccan chick    the first film s unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods    this time   these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors    there s not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason    although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea   it s ruined by poor execution    the follow up to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie    they re trapped in an old big weird house    they stupidly separate into various rooms    there are strange noises   they see scary apparitions and people disappear    ever see this movie    seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better    the film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore    for a storyline filled with surprises   it s oddly predicable       the blair witch project   was a rare triumph of style over substance       the book of shadows   is a triumph of tedium over promise    
Pos,    desperate measures   was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released   summer  97    for some reason   it was delayed until hollywood s traditional dumping ground   january    now that it s out   i see no real reason for that delay   as it s a simple yet highly entertaining film    michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who s bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective   garcia      keaton agrees to the transplant   only so he can attempt escape    he succeeds   in a plan that of course could only work in the movies    the police force is now trying to kill keaton   while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son    the film definately has it s flaws    the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare   but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status    also   after keaton s escape   garcia s captain barks at him   how many men have to die to save your kid s life      which the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark    the thing is   it s a vaild point    how many people have to be needlessly crippled   burned   and killed just to save this one child    what s the greater good here    many lives or one life    if movies really had guts nowadays   i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia s character    place him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else    alas   movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience s strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable    despite a few silly moments   and one or two really stupid ones     the good things about   desperate measures   outnumber the bad    the main highlight would be keaton s performance    the character could have easily been an overacting   scene chewing freak   but keaton underplays it nicely    he s not as menacing as he was in   pacific heights   or even as menacing as he was in   batman     yes kids   batman used to be a dark character     but you certainly get the idea that he s evil    even the final scene of the film   which normally i would just hate   seems strangely appropriate for this film    so much so that i didn t mind it in the slightest    and another bonus   the film takes place in san francisco   which usually means a car chase on those hills that you ve seen a billion times before    and for a moment   it looked as though it was about to happen    but it doesn t   and that s creative    [r]  
Neg, as with any gen x mtv movie   like last year s dead man on campus     the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points   sex and football    those two items   wrapped in a guilty pleasure package   are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially   but sales will decline for two reasons    first   the football sequences are nothing new   nor can they be   the sports genre isn t mainstream and it s been retread to death    second   the sex is just bad    despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all night strip club party   there s nothing even remotely tantalizing    the acting is mostly mediocre   not including the fantastic jon voight    cultivating his usual sliminess   voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer    kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes  twenty two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years   this year he plans to make it twenty three    unfortunately   when his star quarterback   lance harbor   paul walker     goes down for the count   he s got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon   james van der beek      moxon leads the team through its last four games   and then must cope with his newfound stardom   the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie   amy smart     and other temptations that abound in football crazy west canaan    most regions of the country are not nearly as football crazy as texas   and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most    similarly   the set design is wrong for a high school setting   the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms   radio headsets   which never seem to work   however   and instead require coaches to signal plays manually     and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer    these elements   as well as the heavy drinking and carousing   might be more appropriate on a college campus    but mtv s core audience is the high school demographic    this focus is further emphasized by the casting   james van der beek   of tv s   dawson s creek     is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero   although he never manages to do anything with the role    other stars are similarly young and unmemorable    there s not much that goes right about varsity blues   and there s not much to like about it   either    everything herein has already been done   and if it hasn t   the movie manages to botch it one way or another    this is certainly missable    
Neg, barb wire   pamela anderson lee s first foray into films   highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets    being the only notable member of the cast   the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity   making her character s catch line     don t call me babe     sound very ironic indeed    from the very opening of the movie   we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson   ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe    throughout the movie   there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage   if not of anderson s   then at least of the female extras    this alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire    for a plot   barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline    it is 2017   the middle of the second american civil war   and barb wire   a former resistance fighter   runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead   ! !      known for attracting resistance fighters an d characters of all sorts   the bar attracts the attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazi style uniforms    in between bashing up helpless males and showing off her trademark breasts   barb wire has to help a former lover and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town   past the government controlled areas   and to freedom    even the airport looks like the one in casablanca   except that the plane in the background is a modern   private jet    there are hardly any significant moments in this film   and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of   barb wire      if anything   one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di d not do her own stunts    who could fight and jump in a skimpy   strapless leather top   and yet keep her breasts from spilling out    only a stuntwoman    not pamela anderson lee    
Neg, capsule   john the baptist is sent from heaven to see is the world is worth saving    he must find some sign of hope in the people of newfoundland    this is little more than a tv skit in movie form    it is watchable and apparently will be released to theaters in canada   but it is unlikely to be seen on the international market    it is diverting but hardly a serious piece of cinema       0    4 to +4   minor spoilers in this review      written and directed by john w   doyle      john the baptist sent to st   john   newfoundland    gets an invitation to live with a family    that extraordinary hospitality for some reason does not count as a reason for hope      script has a lot of holes      friend who adopts john is surprisingly militant and is planning actions to destabilize wall street      john does look middle eastern   but somehow one expects john the baptist to be more dramatic      there is a conspiracy in the vatican riding on the result of the visit   though that result seems small compared to the end of the world      big yucks like seeing a nun give the pope a pedicure and evil pope s aid praying to a mendes goat      in large part a satire of life in newfoundland taking licks at things like the poor produce    the one good tomato in grocery   by virtue of a miracle     must have fallen off the truck to toronto        based on a 20 minute short film    
Neg, carry on at your convenience is all about the goings on in the factory of a toilet manufacturer   wc boggs   kenneth williams      once they have won an order to manufacture 1000 bidets in two months and charles coote   charles hawtrey   has designed a suitable model   the factory employees set to work but are interrupted by union representative vic spanner   kenneth cope   and friend bernie hulke   bernard bresslaw   who call them out on strikes on the slightest pretext    meanwhile   chief foreman sid plummer   sid james   is growing tired of his wife beattie   hattie jacques   and her budgie    he would much rather live next door with fellow boggs worker chloe moore   joan sims   but once he discovers that the budgie can predict the winners of horse races   he is over the moon and flush with money    his daughter   myrtle plummer   jacki piper     is going out with wc s son lewis boggs   richard o callaghan   and this causes conflict on the staff day out to the seaside when vic spanner vies for her attentions    in the end   if the strike does not cease   boggs will have to close down his factory   but the support of a group of women led by coote s wife to be and spanner s mother   agatha spanner   renee houston     try to resolve the situation    also   sid realises that his budgie has caused him nothing but trouble since it started predicting horse race winners    there are some good performances   as usual   from sid james and kenneth williams in their standard roles    charles hawtrey is third billing but only appears in a few scenes    his part is mildly amusing    richard o callaghan is appealing as bogg s stuck up son   patsy rowlands is funny as miss withering   bogg s assistant   and renee houston is terrific in her small part as agatha    however   sole acting honours go to hattie jacques as beattie plummer    although her character is not directly involved with the main storyline   she manages to input a great deal of pathos and feeling into her character    a marvellous performance from a marvellous actress    the film suffers from annoying performances by bernard bresslaw and especially kenneth cope    in his carry on debut   cope overdoes his role as spanner making him so annoying as to be unfunny    joan sims returns as the love interest   instead of barbara windsor      sims   usual  part as the downtrodden wife was taken by hattie jacques    additionally   bill maynard as fred moore is very poor    this carry on movie tries it best to entertain the viewer     the locations and wealth of characters are appealing    however   the toilet humour becomes tiresome very quickly and some of the performances leave a lot to be desired    this movie does not know where it is going    it was made in 1971 and talbot rothwell the scriptwriter seems to be in two minds whether to go for  bluer  jokes or to maintain the  innocent  jokes success of most of its predecessors    that is why this film suffers    a minor carry on film whose major asset is the performance by hattie jacques    the new  minor regulars  such as o callaghan and piper are not able to enliven the movie and the toilet humour becomes humourless after a while    
Neg, certainly no one would rent ed wood s glen or glenda    expecting to see a good movie   but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn t know was possible    in fact   wood s infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison    watching glen or glenda    i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together   as a result   it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious    the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary   with endless   repetitive narration about transvestites   how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend s clothes without being able to wear them   how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals   and how the main character   glen/glenda is   as it reminds us probably half a dozen times     not half man and half woman   but man and woman at the same time      the camera work is terrible occasionally the camera lingers on   say   a closed door while the characters talk off screen   or inexplicably zooms in on someone s ear or nose    wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage   which leads to voiced over non sequiturs like     yes   our world is a busy and frightening place   with so many people driving their automobiles      finally   there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein style laboratory   delivering pointless lines such as     people            all with their own thoughts            their own ideas                  while lightning crackles quasi ominously overhead    had wood continued in this vein   glen or glenda    probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror movie touch    unfortunately   he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script       pull the string !  pull the string !    announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears    there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns   this time warning us     beware            beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door !              it eats little boys            and puppy dogs  tails            and big fat snails !    a bizarre nightmare sequence   which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid   ensues   during which glen/glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree in the living room    someone who is apparently intended to be the sinister   green dragon     but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series   appears to be orchestrating all this   though the film is far from clear on this point   to put it kindly      near the end of this scene and here i must confess that wood lost me completely is a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music    after this scene ends   not a moment too soon     glen or glenda    returns to its documentary style   but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone    the film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism   but at that point it didn t matter much what happened    as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over   glen or glenda    had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen    i honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could   it still might not match glen or glenda    for sheer cinematic disaster    i am giving this movie an f   but i m not sure that quite does it justice    
Pos, devotees of robert a   heinlein   be forewarned   paul verhoeven s starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein s novel than it is a literary satire    the author s jingo all the way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless   faceless parade of carnage from the film version    and i suppose that s exactly what verhoeven delivers   with sometimes hilarious results    heinlein s basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement   while their strengths become the stuff of high energy entertainment    outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor   since it s basically a big bug hunt       aliens in broad daylight    sometime in the future   humanity is threatened by giant   malevolent insects which have evolved into twenty foot tall action figures   arachnids with super impaling spikes   beetles that spew forth lava   dragonflies with guillotine legs      among those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires   conflicted rich kid johnny rico   casper van dien     his math whiz girlfriend carmen   denise richards     dizzy   dina meyer     who secretly carries a torch for johnny   and carl   neil patrick   doogie howser   harris     who not so secretly carries a torch for dizzy   and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets    while carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence   johnny and dizzy become mobile infantry   their various battles intertwining with romantic sub plots out of a third season episode from   beverly hills 90210      so if starship troopers is another movie where one dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens   what makes it any better than   say   independence day   a movie where one dimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens    for one thing   you sense that the film makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material    the very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate   not just fiscally prudent    if starship troopers had been turned into a tv movie   aaron spelling would have produced it    it s a story which requires emoting   not acting   it s a prime time soap opera with big guns   played for all the dopey melodrama it s worth    the no name cast also plays into verhoeven s treatment of heinlein s most controversial conceit    in this society   we learn   one can only be a full citizen after completing some sort of federal service   military for most    verhoeven pays the notion plenty of lip service   then proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads   named after the world war ii era   why we fight   series   in which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys of firearms   or the pleasures of stomping cockroaches    these characters really are just   fresh meat for the grinder     as one character puts it   which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting    it s not that starship troopers is anti military   because it never treats the true horror of war as anything but a great big   violent video game    in fact   the characters are living the propaganda   particularly johnny   who receives so many field promotions he may not remember his own rank by the time the film ends      verhoeven is actually having it both ways    he s making fun of gung ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh faced recruits into battle on a gung ho booster rocket of visual effects    if that makes starship troopers hypocritical   at least it s enthusiastically staged hypocrisy    there may not be a person worth caring about in the whole film   but it moves like nobody s business    verhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences   sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts then having various body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping    it is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense of pacing to match its budget   i was caught up in the action enough of the time that i wasn t perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings    i wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers   but it didn t work out that way    that would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material    
Neg, here s something to chew on   what s the favorite food of big   cheesy looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising    the obvious answer to this question is cardboard   because that s the depth of the most fully  developed character in this painfully generic creature feature    deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer    in fact   considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas   perhaps it was    the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore    not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh   both human and non human   been scattered in all directions    we learn some bloody trivia   as well   such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red   it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains   and what it does with half digested leftovers    i suppose deep rising s gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre   but it doesn t do much for me    on the surface   and that s about the only level at which this film can be analyzed   deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic   everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection   since james cameron directed both      in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue in cheek mayhem of tremors   deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin    the film is not humorous   tense   or exciting    in fact   it s downright boring   and   despite being half the length of cameron s current box office champ   deep rising feels like the longer movie    is it really necessary to say anything about the plot    probably not   since it s easy to guess   but i ll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis    the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship    in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics   there s finnegan   treat williams     the boat s pilot   who s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff   joey   kevin j   o connor     the inept sidekick who s supposed to be lovable and funny   but is really just irritating     and hanover   wes studi     the   mastermind     and i use that term lightly   of the operation    their goal   attack a cruise ship   clean out the safe   then sink it using some illegally acquired torpedoes    the problem is   by the time they reach the argonautica   the titanic like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste    aside from a beautiful jewel thief   famke janssen   and a couple of crew members   there s no one on board    the reason soon becomes obvious    the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles    the cast   which is led by treat williams   is primarily comprised of has beens and probably never will bes   two exceptions   wes studi   best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans   and djimon hounsou   amistad s cinque      williams   once a   can t miss   prospect in hollywood   has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising   and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career    famke janssen   who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye   is the perfect bland match for williams    given her limited acting abilities   it s likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes    unfortunately   a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee shirt for half of the picture    meanwhile   kevin j   o connor   who has entirely too much screen time   exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard    these days   audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer generated special effects    this is a lesson that writer/director stephen sommers   who previously helmed the live action jungle book   needs to learn    the days of jurassic park   when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen   are past    now   movie goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic    visuals that are so well incorporated that it s impossible to tell where they end and where   reality   begins    in deep rising   the monster   like everything   is artificial and unconvincing    unfortunately   the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn t so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture   but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre   although   to be fair   deep rising is a particularly bad entry      even once this film has sunk out of sight   the knowledgeable viewer knows it won t be the last of its kind    like the slimy   slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies   more are waiting just around the corner in ambush    and that consideration   unlike anything on screen   is truly horrifying    
Pos, i have seen several   but not that many   woody allen movies    i didn t particulary like radio days   the purple rose of cairo   play it again   sam    i quite enjoyed manhatten murder mystery and everything        sex   and i loved might aphrodite    however i found bullets over broadway to be a snoozing bore    and bullets got some very raving reviews   but i didn t think i d like    but i finally saw it   double feature with ready to wear i think   and hated it    since        i love you also seems to be getting raving reviews i wasn t sure if i d want to see        thankfully i did !  people burst into singing and dancing   something i hardly ever like    but this movie is so infectious    and funny !  and entertaining !     and unlike evita   they only sing when they need to      sure some of the actors may not be great singers   but they seems to be having a great time   and so does the audience    that s all i have to say    really   if you think that is going to be a dull movie   you re probably dead    and dead people should not be forced into movie theatres    is mark leeper dead    he said that   this is an almost ghastly misfire      the movie is rated r   for * one * use of the word motherf * * * * *    
Neg, i m not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing   disturbing behavior   with   scream      maybe it s because they re both horror films   kinda     both have hot young stars   both have an annoying alternative soundtrack   and both are aimed at the teenage crowd   which i guess includes me    but this is not the next in line with the   scream   flicks as well as the   i know what you did last summer   soon to be flicks    it owes less to   halloween   and more to kafka and orwell   which   in my book   makes for a more interesting feature    and it should have been    this is basically a rehash of   the stepford wives     the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing   as i ve been told   with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives    or something like that       behavior     starring katie holmes of   dawson s creek     deals with a bunch of teenagers   deep in angst   who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers    suck ups    preppies    it actually   at least to me   sounds like it would work   and with scott rosenberg   that witty penmen who has written stuff like   beautiful girls   and   things to do in denver when you re dead     as well as   con air       it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit    alas   it s not   and it plumets into that little group of movies known as   the movies with potential that blow it      i remember a film called   white man s burden   which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it s potentially brilliant premise    here s another one    it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves    it s a stage   and this film does in fact realize that    it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly    now it just needs to work as a film    which it doesn t    it s too sloppy and too contrived    it paints a bleak portrait of high school life       then  lets it lie    it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss ups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes       then  gives it a cheap twist   when they get horny   they become homicidal    isn t it scary enough that they re like this   and can t the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them   not that you could be next to die    the film introduces us two three different characters who   in the beginning   are considered outsiders because they re not   yet   part of this clique   the new kid   steve   james marsden   dull dull dull dull     who s having trouble at home because he hasn t gotten over his brother s   ethan embry   in quick flashes so you don t recognize him   i did   suicide   the renegade girl   rachel   katie holmes   from   dawson s creek       who s chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring   and by far the most interesting kid   gavin   nick stahl   the kid from   the man without a face       who s the most interesting because he s the only character who s given some dimension    in the film s best scene   he introduces steve to every single clique   nailing each one s fetishes and hang ups   and it s the best scene in the movie because it s witty   satirical   and interesting   something the rest of this film isn t    gavin suspects there s something awry with the preppie kids   known as the blue ribbons   and in the tradition of all conspirators   and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve   he s only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff    here   we have another case of   the idiot plot     where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him   but he may have saved this film from being the dreary   dull film that it is without gavin   who gives it life and humor    the only other half interesting character is the school janitor   played by william sadler as a retarded   scary guy who may not be what he seems to be       but  really   we don t care anyway    i probably shouldn t mention that this was directed by david nutter   who s works for   the x files     because that would probably tarnish his reputation    like the show   he s good at setting up weird conspiracies   and creating a general creepy feel    most of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect   and some of it works    but what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff    he keeps too much inside   so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act   you wonder why they just don t get the hell out of there    i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there s something rotten in the state of teen angstdom    what this film needs to be is a lot longer   a lot more colorful   and a lot creepier    if the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor   played by bruce greenwood   an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent   who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed   then they need to come up with a tougher   smarter villain    if he s so villainous   then why could two dense teenagers who couldn t figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes    the film   which runs about 80 or so minutes   just needs to work on these things   and become a lot less sloppy    at such a short running time and with such lame   boring characters as these   it s pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one s mouth   especially mine    
Neg, if only austin powers   the spy who shagged me had been just half as original   zany   silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor   it would have easily been one of this summer s biggest pleasures    if only    in fact   the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original   instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another   the filmmakers bombard us with used up   tired jokes taken directly from the first one    take the scene where austin powers   again played by mike myers   but with only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously   confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff    after being pushed off the ravine   the bad guy is of course assumed dead    but suddenly   we hear a pleading voice coming from down below   he s only injured    a similar scene played very well in the original international man of mystery   but here i was insulted by it    did the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a rip off    apparently i overestimated the intelligence of the average movie goer   considering that the film has pulled in over $200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone    do i hear the sound of a franchise heading our way    having said that   though   i still cannot deny the film its merits    the basic plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat   dr   evil   mike myers   in the second of his three roles     having constructed a time machine   goes back to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch austin power s   mojo     don t you just love that word      whilst he is cryogenically frozen    when austin gets wind of this   after a great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurley s vanessa kensington     he too travels back in time to re claim his sexual drive   accompanied by the hot to trot felicity shagwell   played by heather graham    this sounds stupid   i know   but in the movie it starts to make some kind of weird   off the wall sense   and it worked for me    then there s mini me   verne troyer     a        petite clone of myer s dr   evil   exactly 1/8 in size    troyer s persona alone gains the film an extra half star   contributing to one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble on his own mini mr    bigglesworth    just try to ignore the fact that   at 2 8     he would make dr   evil s height rise to just over 21 feet    no matter    however   there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour and a half   the most notable being the now infamous tent scene     and that just isn t enough to warrant even a minor recommendation    if there is in fact an   austin powers 3     they should just kill off secret agent powers and put the emphasis on dr   evil and mini me    unconventional   yes   but there s no denying that it d make for a better movie    
Pos, ingredients   down on his luck evangelist   church  synopsis   sonny dewey   robert duvall   is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife   farrah fawcett   in bed with another guy    in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy s head   and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder   and estranged from his wife and two kids    to atone for his sins   sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature     the apostle e   f   as the apostle e   f   sonny s main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station    soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple    but sonny knows his time is short   one day the police will find him    opinion   this movie is a thought provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms    i believe that robert duvall   who is the producer   director   writer   and main star of the apostle   deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader     a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film    duvall s portrayal of a true believer is authentic   superb   and inspired   it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion   as well as a portrait of a fallible   complicated man driven by his beliefs    incidentally   in real life duvall was just as  driven  in getting the project underway    since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist   the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done   paying for its production with his own money   about five million dollars      in terms of hard hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade   and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film    similarly   those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought provoking experience    on the other hand   the apostle s main strength     duvall s preaching     is also what limits the apostle s target audience    in terms of plot and pure entertainment value   the apostle is definitely not for everyone    teenagers   action fans   comedy fans   and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie   since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church    in other words   the apostle is a four star performance   but with a very limited audience    
Pos, just in time for halloween and christmas   the reissue of the nightmare before christmas couldn t be more appropriate    with all of the attention thrown to   family films   in recent years   namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters   it s high time we raised the intellectual level of children s fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios    with that in mind   it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness it had seven years ago    nightmare is the story of one man s quest to discover his true purpose in life    to look beyond the accolades of his peers   the achievements of his years   and the praise of his ego    jack skellington   the pumpkin king of halloweentown   is the main dude behind the halloween holiday for kids everywhere    but during his reign as pumpkin king   jack has somehow lost his understanding of his place in the world and the magic he creates with his halloween holiday    after the completion of one particular halloween season   jack walks with a heavy heart and ends up discovering in the woods outside halloweentown a grove of trees with doors to all of the other holidays in the world    imagine his surprise to discover christmastown   a far more impressive and uplifting holiday than halloween   surrounded by happy elves making toys   and with good cheer all around    upon his return to halloweentown   jack decides to combine halloween and christmas together by kidnapping   sandy claws     employing all the residents of halloweentown to build toys for children    he then aims to take over the role as primary joy provider and gift bearer to the children of the world   in the hopes of rediscovering the zest for life he once had    alas   the co mingling of halloween and christmas creates disastrous results involving shrunken heads   psychotic wooden ducks   a sleigh pulled by a phantom dog with a lighted nose   and a large   sinister   singing bag named oogie boogie  tim burton    the man behind such great films as ed wood   beetlejuice   pee wee s big adventure   and edward scissorhands    is the creative force behind nightmare    originally   burton authored a poem that became the basis of the storyline   and he was jointly involved in the production design of the film   though many mistakenly assume he directed the picture      the stamp of burton is clearly everywhere in the film    with bold colors   imaginative character design   and it s simple yet compelling story    the direction of harry selick   who also directed james and the giant peach   is strong   offering intimate views of the strange collection of characters    also memorable are the songs in the film   written by former oingo boingo lead singer danny elfman   the next john williams of film composing    the nightmare before christmas is intended for both the kid and adult in everyone    it s not just child s play for the holidays   it s a movie about how to be truly happy in a tough world   saying that all you need to do is just be exactly who you are   without compromise    what better message is there for christmas

Pos, satirical films usually fall into one of two categories   1   long term satire where everything   including the jokes   is somehow related on a large scale   i   e       dr    strangelove     2   situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene   i   e       men in black        what s unique about   wag the dog   is that it doesn t necessarily fit either of these descriptions   and yet is both at the same time    the result is a clever comedy based on an original   smart premise   even if the focus does tend to wander a bit    if there s anything that affects americans the most it s politics and showbusiness    in this age of information and technology   we ve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things   it s gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it    we need the media to bring us the most up to date news   but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking    this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas   and then presents an interesting scenario   if politics   the media coverage of politics   and the entertainment industry are so closely related   couldn t someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all    that s the idea conrad brean   de niro     a professional washington spin doctor   comes up with in order to restore the president s good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election    brean   along with the president s top advisor   winifred ames   heche     fly to california to meet up with hot shot movie producer stanley motss   hoffman      they pitch him an idea to   produce   the image of a war with albania   it s a country no one s heard of so they people will buy it      soon the wheels are in motion and the film s riffing satire comes into play    we re inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation   such as a folk singer   visual and sound effects technicians   and a modern style expert known as the fad king   leary      the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv   in the movies   or in the news    the characters  dialogue is witty and funny   although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom esque    for example   one scene shows motss and brean s production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee    motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry   but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs    since it s all computer enhanced anyway   she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later    this demonstrates the film s ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise    but then there s the gags and one liners that   although are humorous   seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress s name   or   whenever a problem emerges   always responding with     this is nothing !    by the time the film makes it to the midpoint   everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens    the first act is quickly paced   while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film    every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with   and it s always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it    the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head on in realistic manners    however   it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject    as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture    what had started off as a brilliant   somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie    still   the situation comedy is quite funny   especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt    willie schumann   a war hero motss and brean concocted    truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time   but think about afterwards and   wag the dog   at least succeeds in this respect    however   in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done   namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes    then again   it s a valiant effort    
Neg, some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door   some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time    playing god asks just one simple   eensy   teensy thing so it can fully entertain you   it s accomplished in just four easy to follow steps   crack open your skull   scoop out your brain   squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one    congratulations   you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing    some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie   others are simply good ideas that are badly executed    then there s playing god   which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director   actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip offs   or homages as they like to call it   from other   better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet    harsh   maybe    justified    hell yes !  this is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes    for example   a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away    this does look moderately kool   but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling     oooh   look look !  john woo !  two guns blazing !  slooooow motion !    and if that wasn t enough   you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie    poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines   you have to admire the effort he puts into it   this guy deserves better    unlike most movies this one does not suffer from   stupid bad guy   syndrome   just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes    example   duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages    now the bad guy is   like   stoned   man   so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero       term used as loosely as possible    survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun   which our hero does   but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds    even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it   going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger    mind you   i ve never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs   be he stoned or not    some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct   the hell with that !  two fbi guys have just been shot in front me   along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second    solution    boom !  i ll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much    another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome    our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her    he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers    he still has his shotgun   bring it along you say    no thanks   i ll just ditch it in the back of my car    and the real kicker is this   when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised !  while we are on the subject of getting shot   why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door    i ve got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door    ask mr   wild bill   the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life    this is the major problem with this movie   any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better    is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters    for instance    our heroes hide at duchovny s summer home   now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment    ok   this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time    but see   our hero is a drug addict and guess what    he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt    oh sure   he ll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling    going clean is really honorable of him   but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun    for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton   plot holes the size of godzilla   getting our intelligence insulted and several   oh come on !    moments

Pos, in   the sweet hereafter     writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living    he shows us how it isn t dying that hurts   but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death   and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings    on a cold winter day in a small   isolated town in british columbia   a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake   where it cracks through the ice and sinks    fourteen children die   and numerous others are hurt    for the residents of this small town   all of whose children were on that bus   it is an earth shattering event that resolutely alters their lives    they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain   but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle    alberta and risa walker   who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident   hire an attorney named mitchell stephens   ian holm   to bring a lawsuit against someone   anyone for responsibility    the bus driver   dolores driscoll   gabrielle rose     is a kindly woman who loved the children and   although she lives with a burden of guilt   is not held responsible for the accident    the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice   and there was nothing should could do to prevent it    however   according to stephens   there are no   accidents   in life   and someone will pay for this tragedy   whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through    he goes through the town   approaching the parents who have lost children   asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger    and   for his work   stephens will receive one third of the settlement money    however   it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money    he is driven by something else   something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents    he has lost a child   too   but not in the same manner    his daughter   zoe   caerthan banks     who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite   has been in and out of drug re hab clinics and detox stations for ten years    she calls him on an irregular basis   begging him for money   but refusing to tell him what she needs it for       i don t know who i m taking to     he tells her    in his mind   his daughter is dead    the lawsuit is   to stephens   not only a way to mend the town s pain   but also his own    however   not everyone in town wants it to happen    billy ansell   bruce greenwood     who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children   wants nothing to do with it    he has already lost his wife   and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman    he doesn t want to talk about the accident   and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds    to him   the town should be able to take care of its own pain   and it doesn t need outsiders like stephens getting in the way    central to   the sweet hereafter   is the tale of nicole burnell   sarah polley     a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into   a wheelchair girl     as she puts it    aside from stephens   nicole is the most complex character in the film   and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out    it is also her sad   haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack   reading robert browning s poem about the pied piper   and how when he led all the town s children away   one was left behind because he was crippled    obviously   nicole is that child   and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town s children left her alone by dying in the wreck    her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving   but incestuous relationship with her father   tom mccamus      there is only one   fleeting scene that suggests this relationship   but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film    of all the storylines in   the sweet hereafter     this is the most complicated and unresolved   although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film    egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers    if any at all    and he doesn t condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up    what egoyan has done in   the sweet hereafter   is really nothing short of miraculous    in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks   he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss   and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life    egoyan has always been a talented   but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold       the sweet hereafter   is quite the opposite   egoyan s stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion   and draw the audience into the tragedy       the sweet hereafter   seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked    the film is filled with beautiful   subtle performances from all the actors   especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind    the beautiful   roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting   melodic musical score by mychael danna   both previous egoyan collaborators   give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements    like his earlier films   egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole    he works with time as a fluid substance   shifting back and forth between the past   the distant past   and the present with effortless ease    the actual bus wreck itself doesn t happen until midway through the film   but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail   and still have it carry great   devastating weight    because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies   it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple   direct terms    certainly one of the best films of 1997     the sweet hereafter   is a deeply rewarding   mystifying   and ultimately human film    
Pos, it s wednesday   march 27   and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte   south carolina    the crime   a young prostitute   elizabeth   renee zellweger     has been brutally slain    one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station    the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority   miles away    the police duo of braxton   chris penn   and kennesaw   michael rooker   are strapped for leads    at the moment   they have only one possible suspect   wayland   tim roth     a wealthy   unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act    that s the premise for deceiver   a new thriller from the pate brothers   jonas and josh   who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave    deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not  so bright cops   captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland s iq is 151   by contrast   kennesaw s is 122 and braxton s is 102      the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered    over three days   as wayland returns to answer more questions   the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until   inevitably   it boils over    other plot elements are thrown in for good measure    wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can   in stressful situations   render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent    braxton   a compulsive gambler   is deep in debt to a local syndicate    and kennesaw is haunted by a dark   abusive side that delights in terrorizing women   especially his wife   rosanna arquette     whom he suspects of being unfaithful    the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth s death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand   the suspect or his questioners    deceiver   which mostly transpires in a dimly lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue   has the feel of a david mamet play   edgy   claustrophobic   and tense    the atmosphere is explosive   and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting    deceiver has the power to grab an audience    unfortunately   in the end   it succumbs to the need to throw in one last   unexpected twist   and this is its undoing    for   while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers   it also stretches our credulity too much   and raises more questions than it answers    it s only an effective wrap up if you don t think too carefully about its full implications    of course   the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic    police procedure is totally ignored and it s almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner    but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction   not plot details    deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station   and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute    the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth s final days and hours    the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice over by visually showing what really happened    moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks    the movie   obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir   drips atmosphere    there are some fascinating stylistic touches   for example   although the setting is contemporary   all of the telephones are old fashioned   rotary models    cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver s look    some of the things he tries   mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow   work exceptionally well   while others   like any of several lazy susan shots   seem more like unnecessary visual tricks    as wayland   tim roth gives the film s top performance   despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting    roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he s supposed to be    the other two leads   chris penn and michael rooker   aren t as effective    both play their characters like familiar types    penn s performance is uninspired   rooker s lacks subtlety    some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors    renee zellweger   in a role that s miles away from her star making turn in jerry maguire   brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature    rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw s wife   and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who s entrusted with evaluating wayland s condition    one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience    plot points aren t hammered home   and   although the ending has its weaknesses   everything isn t spelled out in bold letters    the pates give audience members credit for having brains   which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers    occasionally gripping and never uninteresting   deceiver is a fine noir effort    
Neg, it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable    the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed    it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers   james horner    what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995    what drags braveheart down is its screenplay    it abounds with high production values   john toll s award winning cinematography   which also graced edward zwick s 1994 legends of the fall     a gorgeous score by horner   and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names    but this does not save a misguided script    the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero   but the viewer s only response to his   heroism   is intellectual   william wallace   producer director mel gibson   is fighting for freedom and against tyranny   so we have to root for him    but wallace s actions paint a different story    he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance    though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side   the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait   in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king    wallace speaks of freedom   but his acts point toward vengeance    after kicking the english out of scotland   he decides to invade england    this is evident of a   spartacus complex     and this example applies both historically and cinematically    the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities   the film spartacus   like braveheart   has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay    it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film    horner s score tries to make emotional connection   but the performances and the script do not help    gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him    this drags down any emotional connection to the film s plot   and turns three hours into a total waste of time    
Pos, lean   mean   escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by    most are unnecessarily complicated   and others have no sense of expediency    the thrill ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot    perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive   which featured none of the flash bang effects of today s market but rather a bread and butter   textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about    the latest tony scott movie   enemy of the state   doesn t make it to that level    it s a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers   without looking back    although director scott has made missteps in the past   such as the lame thriller the fan   he s generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun    that vibrant spirit is present here   shown in well timed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed    enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography    director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount of different views   angles   lenses   and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience in the movie    enemy is truly a visual experience   and that s only one of the reasons it s such a fun watch    the movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds   jon voight      reynolds wants a new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment   but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee    reynolds has the senator offed   but not before the murder is caught on a naturalist s camera    by an extremist chain of events   the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean   will smith    s posession   and it s not long before he s running from reynolds  cronies    it s only with the help of an ex spook named brill   gene hackman   that dean is able to get to the bottom of things    the acting is top notch   and the three principles   smith   hackman   and voight   are generally more mature and excellent all around    smith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes a normal human being   voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence   and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role    smith s regular joe comes off particularly well   as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not    the supports are also in fine form   lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas    this is   for the holiday crowd   the hot ticket   as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is otherwise lacking

Neg, movies like six days   seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford   anne heche   and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents      the script was written by michael browning   and he decided that   instead of thinking up new ideas   he d rehash a lot of cliches   omit even the slightest bit of character development   and then throw in drug dealing pirates to provide for a few high level action sequences and explosions      there are good scripts out there that high profile actors can make   see the truman show   for instance        six days   seven nights is simply a waste    let s see            we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island      so   how do we do that      well   we ll make her a feisty magazine editor   and we ll make him a crusty old pilot      but wait   she has to have a fianc   e   that can be david schwimmer      but wait   if she has a fianc   e   how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone      i know !    they ll get to their vacation spot   and then she ll get called back !    yessssss !    so   they ll crash on the island   and that will be funny for about five minutes      shucks    oh   i ve got it !    we ll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc   e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo   and then he can feel guilty      then   when anne heche kisses harrison ford   they have to kiss   because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie     it will be a vindicated action   because her fianc   e will already have cheated on her !    then   for no obvious reason   they ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them      oh   yes !    i feel so good about this story      instead of using characterization to propel the events   it will be completely random   and yet totally predictable !    imagine that    don t get me wrong    six days   seven nights is not a boring picture   ford and heche both do a great job      the sparks fly between them   and so most of browning s inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors  sheer force of talent       almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen   and i found myself laughing pretty hard      schwimmer is also funny   and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get      and reitman   who has made some good films   at least tries to make things exciting      even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb   i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences    it s just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces      the picture feels like it s been hacked to pieces    i wouldn t be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely      the ones that are here are as bad as they come   i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships     and i d just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream     why did you pick this awful script !        the film is outright stupid   but some of the elements are subtly horrifying      for instance   take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo   and then feels really guilty      this is a serious problem in real life   but six days   seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device     his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford      in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety   i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story    this is summer movie season   but that doesn t mean our movies have to be dumb      1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters      when i was in line for six days   seven nights   i heard the woman in front of me ask for   two tickets to that new harrison ford movie         why didn t she know the name of the film      i suppose she just didn t care       what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big budget pictures don t realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves      good actors should sign to good scripts   and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash   they least they could do is assume that we d like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents    
Pos, notting hill s trailer is awful   a laughless   schmaltzy montage    the movie was desperately marketed to the anti phantom menace crowd   the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter    and it apparently worked    perhaps the presence of julia roberts whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me had a lot to do with notting hill s opening weekend success   but the film s staying power is based on word of mouth    allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill    grant stars as william thacker   a travel bookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill    into his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott   roberts      a common thief   some spilled orange juice   and some stilted conversation leads to their first   highly impetuous   or is that improbable       kiss    days later   william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist   and so begins a passionate   albeit surreptitious   affair       aside   notting hill s portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate      only anna s celebrity or william s lack thereof threatens to drive a wedge between them    richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered   and for at least its first half hour the picture s   beauty and the beast    like scenario is   romantic   escapism of the highest order    as with groundhog day or pleasantville   while watching the high concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him/herself in the lead   it s william s ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna    curtis   who previously penned four weddings and a funeral   is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple s situation is not enough to fuel two hours  worth of entertainment   so some of notting hill s finest moments revolve around william s eccentric friends and family    by now   dear reader   you ve probably heard a lot about rhys ifans  performance as william s imbecilic welsh flatmate    yes   he s a crowd pleaser   a walking sight gag   but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair bound   and appropriately named   bella   mckee   the anguished waitress of naked   or max   tom mcinnerny     her lousy chef of a husband    in the movie s best sequence   william   anna   and company sit around bloated from max s latest concoction and hold a contest   the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life    the scene ends only as a british writer would end it    if anything   fantastic bits like these dull the main plot s dramatic impact    roberts and grant   especially   are appealing   but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times   four weddings  suffered similar flaws     and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common   they re lonely       worth noting in roberts  and grant s favour   the ubiquitous   i m just a girl   standing across from a boy   asking him to love her   episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips   and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done      notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable   on the visual side of things   i especially appreciated michell s playful changing of the seasons number    if only   and this is a surprisinly minor gripe   he had lopped off the egregious epilogue   for a story that thrives on what we bring to it   the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up   leaving our imaginations in the lurch

Neg, tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers   all searching for deeper meaning    however   they won t find much meaning in the real blonde   and not enough real humor   either    joe   matthew modine   is a struggling actor   or he claims to be one   even though he has no credits under his belt    his girlfriend   mary   catherine keener   has no pretensions about her career   she s a makeup artist   working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair   marlo thomas   and supermodel of the month   sahara   bridgette wilson      sahara   who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid   has an on again   off again relationship with joe s best friend   bob   maxwell caulfield      however   bob has gotten his biggest break yet   a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly   daryl hannah     who may be that illusive woman he s always pursued   a real blonde    there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde   but not enough    the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background   such as sahara s perfume ads     depression   it s not just a state of mind      but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel    and   unfortunately   the film s forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic    take for example the film s framing device of an old lady and her dog    the story serves absolutely no purpose   makes little sense   and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie    matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film   but they re stuck in the most boring plotlines    modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley   who appears as another struggling actor    keener s character has a stronger edge   but the insult self defense class   taught by denis leary   no less   she is stuck in makes little sense    the movie s running time is under two hours   but it seems like it is well over it    there s just not enough humor to speed things along   and not enough meaning to propel any drama    
Neg, vikings v   bears    no   this isn t the lineup for monday night football    rather   these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in   the 13th warrior     a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory    based on michael crichton s book   eaters of the dead   this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought    their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword    luckily for the vikings   however   their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film    antonio bandaras is ahmed   a travelling ambassador    accompanied by his friend   omar shariff in a cameo     they eventually come across a small viking village    we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude    they laugh heartily   revel in their arrogance   and sing songs of battles won    but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land    help is needed quickly    an elderly   fortune telling witch arrives    after a brief incantation   she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more   not of norse blood   are needed to ensure victory    personally   i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity    nonetheless   12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th    the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives    of course during their ride   ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors    but he ably shows that it s not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog    he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings   but will his skills   and that of the group   be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside    it does not look promising    these creatures   resembling bears   are strong and have high morale    they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies    they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon    the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods    they are ready to sacrifice their lives       this is a good way to die     says one of the fallen warriors    despite the larger than life battle sequences   i was unmoved by the entire experience    at many points   i was even confused    for example   somewhere in the middle of the film   a sub plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land    he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis    however   the sub plot never fully materializes   and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion    there are other questions that i had   but the real problem was that the story   little of it that there was   offered no characters to love or hate    the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma    however   banderas s role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special    an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order    also   much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night   which made battles very difficult to follow    i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy    as it stands   the film manages more confusion than intensity    it would make thor cry

Pos, i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars    from my first viewing   i noticed that david mamet s film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning    from my second viewing however   i noticed that mamet s script was actually a masterpiece    the spanish prisoner   like the usual suspects or chinatown   begs for the viewer s complete attention    miss a scene or even a small detail   and you could miss the meaning of the entire film    also like the aforementioned films   it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending    mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games    like his past gem   the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much   or even more   than the victim    because we were deceived just like the victim   we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film    mamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped   but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end    the power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over   without giving a right answer   is unique and ingenious    the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued    after seeing the film again   i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening    his direction is very subtle   as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them   or think you see all of them    the story follows a young up and coming businessman   joe ross     campbell scott   who has just created a mysterious and lucrative   process   that everyone is trying to get their hands on    soon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his   process      through his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters   the rich and popular jimmy dell   a secretary who has a huge crush on ross   and ross  boss mr   klein    played by steve martin   rebecca pidgeon   and ben gazarra respectively   the supporting cast is very solid especially martin   who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role    the most interesting character in the film   though   was campbell scott s joe ross    the character s transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable    david mamet s script is so interesting because we know people don t actually talk like the characters in the film   yet we feel so connected to some of them    his beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge    this is a must see   for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie

Pos, it s been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller   where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters   but it s been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters   not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles   flaws   and strengths to emerge so radiantly    i d saw that it s been at least a couple decades   even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers   though i m hardly comparing   a simple plan   to   say     rear window   or   strangers on a train      yet it s almost as good    it s simple   yet strangely complex   and astonishingly rewarding   because instead of moving from plot point to plot point   and merely laying out they might be caught overtones   it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to   all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral    elegantly directed by sam raimi   yes   the same       a simple plan   concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright   moderately financially stable working man   bill paxton     his dim witted brother   billy bob thornton     and his drinking buddy   brent briscoe      without anyone around   and the possibility that no one would come looking for it   the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes   they will keep it   but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking   and so they generally don t flaunt anything they don t want to flaunt   they ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton    the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse   a   they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities   b   they could try to fight off the rightful owners   who are either villainous or just   or c   they could fight amongst themselves       a simple plan     though borrows a little from each of these    a little tiff with the cops here   a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent   a chilling gary cole   there     and a bit of inside feuding over here    but   as austin powers would say   that s not necessarily its bag   baby      what i most admired about this film   and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it s successfully able to have its cake and eat it too    it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches   like the ones mentioned above   but at the same time   it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag    so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up   and these subsequent steps go miserably awry   the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to   they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity    in one early scene   paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn t look like it was all stolen   not a bad idea     when thornton screws up   as he does continuously throughout the movie     and paxton has to do some major covering up   read   homicide      instead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands washing   raimi shows a lengthy   painful shot from a low angle onto paxton s face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion    there s a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he s committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective   but the previous shot is even better   more morally complex and more gut wrenching    in short   probably the best piece of direction raimi s ever done   demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results   for further proof   watch   persona    s   sex scene   and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman s ever done      but the film hardly stops here   it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof    yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story    when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical   with aid from his pregnant wife   played by bridget fonda   a pal to raimi     he does   and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights    there s at least two grand shootouts   and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history   and when they arrive   they don t come with masochistic delight but with cringe inducing horror    during the one   i was actually sinking into my chair   with the mantra   they can t do this   can they      streeming through my head    in fact   this film   which is getting many comparisons to the coen s [superior   but forget about it]   fargo     has many similar moments of manic insanity   attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what   in other hands   would be over the top distractedness   imagine   i suppose   robert rodriguez directing this       then  again   after seeing the   evil dead   films   i d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off   although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed   raimi   moments   a rifle shot notwithstanding      instead   raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch   easily letting the story and characters co exist   while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out   like some offbeat comic touches    most particularly   billy bob thornton s character   jacob   is a brilliant creation    his dim wittedness is often hilarious   for most of the film   every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter     but there s authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we re not totally laughing at him    the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full condescension because thornton is so damn real    jacob s a multi dimensional character   and while being stupid   we see that as not so much a flaw   but a strength to his character   his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system   primarily towards the middle where his bud and co conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money    the final third of the film spends much time with him   and many of the touches upon his character   not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b   smith   adapting his own book   by the way   are just great    i particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend   told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near sweetness and further strength of his saddened character    thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance   by far the best performance he s ever given and further proof that he s the best character actor in contemporary cinema   if you don t believe me   go back and watch his wonderful performance in   primary colors     a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn t been in the same year   because he s easily able to slip into a character   and make him completely and utterly believable    he brings so much weight to the film that   as it is with most character actors   it s difficult picturing anyone else in the role    the rest of the cast is great too   from paxton s declining working man to chelcie ross  amiable town sheriff    even fonda shows off her talents nicely    and if i had any complaints about the film   it s that the plot is almost too simplistic   and that at times   it seems too much like an exercise   like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved    and the occasional narration is   as it usually is   annoying   narration should be used with extreme caution   especially when you re trying to set things up and/or express emotions   didn t raimi watch the first murder scene        and   the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie   the ending is basically amiss    i won t reveal it   but it s way too cruel and too much of an outsider set up   as if the appearance of a plane wasn t already too much of that anyway    for a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved   this is the wrong ending    imagine a character controlled ending   otherwise   it s like if in   crime and punishment   if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing       not that i m at all comparing   a simple plan   to dostoevsky    the ending does work   despite my protestations   but to me   there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it   but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it   then just ignore me and go about your day    but despite my mere claims   make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout   and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured   not because of any kind of gore factor   which is   thankfully for this   very minimal     but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile    at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece    
Pos, oliver stone s latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents    it s a three hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century    stone doesn t hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house    the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done    at the same time he creates a very human character   a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics   which is here pictured as a wild animal    he is simply trying to tame it    but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president s ability to control them    stone doesn t in any way apologize for nixon    he blames not only nixon s own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself   the system that   once set in motion   behaves with a mindlessness of its own       nixon   is a modern shakespeare story   a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws    there s something almost majestic about the process   as nixon goes down in this film   there is no gloating   but a watery sigh   as of a great ship sinking    sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding   creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president    joan allen s magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette    she is strong and loyal as mrs   nixon    the rest of the cast is equally magnificent   including   james woods   j   t   walsh   paul sorvino   ed harris and bob hoskins    everyone does a serious and demanding job   no one are disappointing    stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy   honest and determined    he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element    at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon s youth and childhood    the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin   robert richardson s rich cinematography and john williams  musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere    the film s only fault is that it s a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers    still it s an honest and captivating   a solid piece of movie making    
Pos, people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels   stories   comic books or movies    often science fiction aficionados find material   previously labelled as science fiction   to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror   or rather simple techno thriller    in such cases   mistakes are understandable   genre boundaries are never clearly marked    but   i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic    such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago   when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff   1983 film directed by philip kaufman    the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits    but the right stuff film isn t even fiction    it was based on the non fiction book by tom wolfe   covering the early years of american space program    the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base   major test site for experimental planes    the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier    many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado    but one quiet pilot   chuck eager   played by sam shaped   succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots   determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records    ten years later   soviets have launched   sputnik   marking the beginning of the space age    in order to regain national prestige   us government decides to be the first to send man into space    best air force   navy and marine pilots are recruited into program   but not yeager   because he lacks college education and desired all american image    in one of critics  polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s    such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman s film looks quite atypical for its time    with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s   age when hollywood used to make films larger than life    but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker    philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original   memorable movies    the right stuff was the last of them   swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual   risk taking   artsy   projects    the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film    the plot is almost non existent and not very coherent   the story   featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes   shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots   embodied in yeager   to new generation of the astronauts    the film also lacks conventional protagonist   yeager   who also appears in small cameo   remains the true hero of the film   but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives   making this movie into ensemble piece    that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents   until that specialised only for bit or character roles    sam shepard is great as yeager   war hero whose greatest achievement   breech of the sound barrier   remained obscured in history books   probably due to his own modesty    on the surface   he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues   but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases    shepard s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean cut marine   and future politician   john glenn    young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper   and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom   superbly played by fred ward    always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and   arguably   first american man in space alan shepard    kaufman left room for female talents to excel too   barbara hershey   pamela reed   veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots  wives    royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher   but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice president lyndon b   johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch    great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman s superb direction    most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time    the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert   as virtual unknowns   far away from strict rules and discipline    everything seems natural  yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world    in that setting   it s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights    but the times are changing   ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war   and   natural   pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined   conventional pilots    their entire lives become focus of media frenzy   and their job is subjected to strict rules   meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats   publicity seeking politicians and uncaring scientists   like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun   played by scott beach   only to preserve their most basic human dignity    this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence   while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity     mercury   astronauts receive fame and fortune   although some of them even before going in the space    those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman s superb use of poetic movie language    editing is great   and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion   the same image would be copied in many latter films      although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military   which provided authentic locations and period equipment   he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights    those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space    another fine contribution of this film is   oscar    awarded musical score by bill conti   i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it    it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy    some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period    this film is great   and its cult status is well deserved   but there are some minor flaws    some of the   mercury   astronauts aren t fleshed out enough   although being played by fine actors   like lance henriksen      film also lacks proper closure    on the other hand   most logical conclusion of the film   landing on the moon   would require this film to be more than six hours long    also   some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians   who were portrayed as evil monsters   just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan s america    in some of contemporary interviews   kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible   and in order to do that   he portrayed russians not as they were in real life   but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s    time has passed   now we don t see astronauts as heroes    in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions   those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers    few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up    but this film   sentimental reminder of the times   when future began     perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow   mercury   astronauts  footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky    and even if they decide to stay on earth   they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema    
Neg, perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with         this is the fake news     norm macdonald   at times   could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi offensive phrases in his raspy voice   coated with a condescending attitude    his shtick was marked by crassness    in this movie   for example   when his girlfriend says that she s kicking him out because he s been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months   he tries to calm the situation by saying     maybe you ll feel better after we have some dirty sex      this kind of humor can only go so far   but certainly can t go the distance in a full length feature       dirty work     is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically    emotionally   they ve never outgrown their pubescent years   which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback    although having no apparent real world skills   the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people    if the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket   then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart    mitch   norm macdonald   and sam   artie lange   need to come up with $50   000 in a period of two weeks so that sam s dad   jack warden   can have a heart operation    their idea is to start a revenge for hire business where they ll do your dirty work    in the funniest scene   and possibly the only funny scene   of the movie   they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot    their presence is established   but when a less than honorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment   the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge    by default   dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots   but it delivers jerky boys level material    except for the bit at the used car lot   and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers     the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call    already weak on material   it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs  broads  and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction    but what s really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor    relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying   note to self       note to self   learn to fight     he says after getting beat up     note to self   there s always beer     he says after hitting rock bottom   etc       we feel like we re just watching an elongated rehash of his not so glorious days on saturday night live    much like the television show   for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits    the rest of the story is just dead space    
Neg, plot   a rich psychiatrist with a great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients    of course   the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has a few hours to comply with their demands   before they kill his daughter    pretty good premise   no    critique   if you re not a fan of movies packed with plot holes   inconsistencies and yes   even more plot holes   heed my words and skip this hollow thriller    and i don t like saying that either   since this film actually had some potential and started off pretty well    sure   the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom   primal fear and nick of time pureed into one   but the whole   psychiatrist working against the clock   thing   actually had me engaged at first    but it s at about the halfway mark of this movie   that the bottom drops out and all that we re left with are a lot of questions and very few plausible answers    we get the overly smart kid who manages to   pull one   over on the bad guys    we get a weak woman with her leg in a cast beating the crap out of a tough bad guy    we get douglas  character   a new york uppedity psychiatrist   suddenly turning into an action hero   with moves and attitude to boot    and what about the film s main plot point    why would the bad guys still give a crap about this thing after 10 years   and even more so   why would they only give the shrink until the day s end to do his part       you waited 10 years   what s another few days     or why not set up another heist instead        i ll tell you why   it s because we wouldn t have a   bad   movie otherwise   that s why !  and many   many more    ugh   whatever the case   it was just about the time that douglas  character suddenly removed murphy s character from the mental home   and how come she went with him so nicely    i thought she didn t trust him     that i turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into a joke    and a few bogus chase and action sequences later   we were left with a long winded ending that did little to answer any other questions i might ve still had   and actually brought up even more contradictions    badly put together   this movie features some decent acting   some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise   but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you with little care for anyone    in fact   if it wasn t for brittany murphy s excellent portrayal of a traumatized teen   jennifer esposito s embarrassing performance as a police woman   yeah   right !  watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick  but it wasn t supposed to be   and michael douglas  cool   regular guy   part   there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture    incidentally   can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito s character was in this movie in the first place    she was completely superfluous    and on top of all that   by the end of this flick   the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most of the garbage that he d been shoveling out for the hour and a half prior   and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back to an earlier character s death when one of the bad guys dies   just so we know   as an audience     that the two are interrelated somehow    ooooh   thanks   mr   fleder       i  appreciate the spoon feeding   dude       yum    yum       but  how about explaining every other plot point in your film that made no sense    whatever    either way   i don t give a rat s ass because this movie is a dog and that s unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it    see it if you like dumb thrillers    incidentally   if you appreciated along came a spider   you will likely enjoy this film as well    they both start off with interesting premises   only to toss all logic and sense out the window about halfway through    where s joblo coming from    along came a spider   4/10     girl   interrupted   5/10     kiss the girls   7/10     primal fear   7/10      seven   10/10

Neg, possibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk    it smashed u   s box office office records in it s opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here    but is it any good    in a word   no    i ll elaborate further    the story is as follows    apparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on    one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened       see jurrasic park      imgen   the company that funded jurrasic park   want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to a new attraction in san diago    realizing what a bad idea this is   proffessor john hammond   richard attenborough   decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs   so as to rally public support to preserve the island    enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there    so   basically   what you have is this    two teams   one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other   trying to document them   being forced to work together   fighting for survival against the dinosaurs  firm intentions on eating them    a fairly good idea   however it s let down by one slight problem    it s crap    over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring   way too quiclky    add to this a terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested    it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like    what s for tea     and  should you cut the lawn later         yes   you should      it s a shame then really   that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in   which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park    with only a few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous c   g   i  dinosaurs   the t   rex s have to be seen to be believed     there is nothing else to recommend the lost world    a very dissapointing sequel   indeed    
Pos, seen december 28   1997 at 8   45 p   m   at the crossgates mall cinema 18   guilderland   ny     theater #8   with matt perreault and my sister jena for free   matt paid using pre paid passes      if there s ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non  stop action   the james bond films are it    and if there s ever been a james bond film that not only proves this   but does so by pushing it to the extreme     tomorrow never dies   is it    opening sequences almost always make or break action films    when done properly   not only are they actually exciting   but they foreshadow things to come    this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie   but with a sense of the self aware   enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in    first there s a high tech   slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly   chinese waters    there s definite tension as there seems to be an unknown   but certainly hostile   third party involved who is manipulating both sides    when the scene ends in tragedy   it s clear there s some kind of powerful conspiracy going on   and who else to call on for such a case but james bond    the film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond   brosnon      as the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious   bond is clearly   and obviously   depicted as an out and out hero    he single handedly takes out a small army of terrorists   and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co pilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down !  this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for   over    using   but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly    it s not about the payoff because it s obvious bond will escape   instead   it s the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it   all the while creating for witty   hysterical comedy    it seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore   because of political correctness   and just plain copping out on behalf of the filmmakers   even the term   villain   sounds passe      what the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come   yet making him seem completely plausible    jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant   cunning elliot carver   a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world   that is   through his massive media empire   not through nuclear weapons    through some interesting detective work   bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news    not only is that an original idea for a conflict   but one which could carry over into reality    surprisingly   this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become    the film s hook is the action   and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way    the story works much like bond himself   always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot    somehow a chinese agent   wai lin   yeoh     bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together    the chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid   but also works because of this   not in spite of it    the two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons   yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story    although   tomorrow never dies   is far from perfect   it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue    
Neg, synopsis   an aging master art thief   his supplier   and a young   buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be   or are they     in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium    comments   this movie was boring    plain and simple    entrapment should not have been boring    it stars sean connery   who can still carry an action film despite his age   catherine zeta jones   a likeable enough film presence   and ving rhames   ultra cool star of pulp fiction and mission   impossible    it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears   a current   hot topic   in the news   in its storyline   which is set at the end of 1999    it has some genuinely well staged action sequences    so   what went wrong    plenty   unfortunately    the major problem with entrapment is its script    it has a been there   done that feel to it    nothing seems particularly inventive or original   so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags   it runs nearly two hours      the screenwriters   for example   periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes   i   e       4 days to the millennium        this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci fi film strange days    the characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning   which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth   surprise   revelation is made    entrapment   in other words   relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character s true motive is   resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion    the star power here is quite strong   but the viewer can t help but feel the actors are wasted in this production    sean connery is given such mind numbing lines as   never trust a naked woman      ving rhames  character seems like an afterthought   he s not developed at all    the camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zeta jones s tight wardrobe    this   in and of itself   is not bad   but   after a while   it has a juvenile feel to it    at least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that they re exploiting the female body    entrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development   sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her   in tights   arc and pivot around laser beams      the tagline for this movie reads   the trap is set      it sure is   on those who spent money to see this movie    entrapment really isn t that bad   it is watchable    i would suggest   however   one waits until this is on cable or television to see it    
Neg, the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic    finding an all star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius    combining all that with a three time oscar winning director   robert benton of   kramer vs    kramer     and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment    in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood    how many of these have we seen during the past few years       the atmosphere is moody   the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere    over 70 harry ross   paul newman   is a washed up cop turned private eye turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life    he s screwed up things pretty well     i had a wife and daughter    now   i m a drunk   and is at a crossroads    a couple of years ago   he traveled to mexico to bring back mel   reese witherspoon     the under age daughter of jack   gene hackman   and catherine   susan sarandon   ames and now lives with them    the ames are former movie stars   past their prime and the three have become fast friends    one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up    to fill his time   he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine    jack is in even worse shape than harry    he s dying of cancer with only a year to live    things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him    instead of the routine errand that ross expects   he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex cop who is   himself   full of bloody holes    this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine s first husband 20 years before    through a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder   blackmail   guns   mel s mexico traveling partner and his parole officer   ross s former cop buddies   ex lover and would be sidekick   the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to    it s a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale   but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about    the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario    by the time they show you   it doesn t matter    the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross s relationship with rubin   giancarlo esposito     a partner wannabe    these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief   however they are neither    rubin and ross have some past relationship but either it s not explained or i didn t care enough at that point to remember    a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform    it s also not funny   doesn t connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course    on the positive side   it s often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen    the three leads all have well deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished   if not extraordinary jobs    newman is a grand actor   but doesn t seem quite suited to the dark film style    he is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out    hackman   also low key   is believable but lacks sparkle    sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one dimensional    the actors do what they can with lame dialog   but they can t pull the film out of the hole it s dug for itself    james garner who plays ross s old buddy ex cop raymond hope is always a treat   but even he half heartedly struggles through lines like   i m glad they didn t shoot your pecker off      the best part of the film is the look at old friends   how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make    the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen  the film doesn t run very long before the audience realizes that it s hopeless    the only reason for watching is the actors    it reminds me of disaster movies such as   towering inferno   where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the film s problems    in a better world   there would have been second rate actors in this second rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better    of course   we don t live in that better world   but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie    
Pos, the postman delivers but not first class  the postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman  [warning   my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons   post apocalypse stories   hope in a desperate situation   grassroots uprisings and kevin costner    even worse   i thought that   waterworld   was watchable    read the following with those particular grains of salt   ]  it s the year 2013 and things have fallen apart    due to a world war in the late nineties   the resulting three year winter and a devastating plague   life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms    although this is the future   it looks like a western    as the film opens   kevin costner   his character s name is never revealed   is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company    giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging   costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders    running into even worse luck   he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem   will patton      the rag tag retro futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the   clan    after a brutal boot camp   he   and you can see this coming a mile away   escapes    taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck   he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either    once he reaches oregon   land of beautiful women   bright youngsters and rock and roll   he pretends to be a representative from the   restored congress of the united states of america      this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants    food and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby   olivia williams   who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile    shortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman   as costner is referred to for the rest of the film   become a reluctant item    although the postman knows he s running a fraud   the concept of renewed communications sets the kids  imagination afire   especially ford lincoln mercury   larenz tate     his second in command   and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through    the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists  tyranny    the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner    although the movie appeals to my sensibilities   there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted    it s derivitive of costner s own   waterworld   and clint eastwood westerns    there s little here that we haven t seen dozens of times before    the film is often down right corny    a scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright eyed child is embarrassing in its slow motion banality    the film s final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor    despite the film s excessive three hour length   several things are never explained    what was the war about    how did civilization change so rapidly    everyone has horses   where did all they come from    the   law of eights   that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film   but where    are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn t made their way west to help or conquer    there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn t appear to make sense    the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments   but beyond that there are some oddities    the evil army is called   holnists   which sounds coincidentally like the new age   holism     but why    is it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013   just one year after many ancient prophesies   including the ending of the mayan calendar   predict a new world for mankind    why is the general named   bethlehem      there seems to be some reason for that   but what    sometimes the movie feels like a joke    an army of postal workers armed with guns    considering the headlines of recent years   it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys    it s even more difficult to accept those re powering the federal government as the heroes    given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government   it s asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film s nationalism    even with its numerous flaws   the movie all comes together   if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have    it s doubtful that   the postman   is going to find much of an audience   but a few of us are going to have a good time    besides we re all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug       michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the   michael redman   arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is   to the best of his knowledge   not him    perhaps this similarly named person should have used kevin costner s postal service      
Neg, the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes   with everything ranging from   l   a   confidential   to   palmetto   to   the big lebowski     has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran   talented directors    with this particular genre   directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower class and the glamorous   opulent upper class   while maintaining the noirish   ambiguous ambience   the staple of film noir       wild things   could be classified as a black comedy   a sultry film noir or a plain ol  erotic thriller   but the one category it doesn t qualify for is that of a quality motion picture    overacted   overwrought and overlong     wild things   is a confused mess   a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too    with its incalculable twists   turns   more twists and more turns   it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness    in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon   who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal     wild things   not once jells in its eroticism   unpredictability   character motivation   sense of the world   plot   etc   there s not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical    directed by john mcnaughton     henry   portrait of a serial killer         wild things   follows sam lombardo   matt dillon     a hunkish   suburban florida high school teacher who s the dream of every spruced up female in the community    particularly one    kelly van ryan   denise richards   adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner    soon   her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike   enabling her to come into his house    next thing   she cries rape    and the so called   roller coaster ride   ensues    a second accuser comes front   suzie toller   neve campbell     a booze drinkin    tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her   virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions   asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen    even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo s zany lawyer    he wears a fake neck  brace   waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray    you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role    as ridiculous as it sounds   he s the most sane character in the movie    the community is astonished    reporters flee to the scene    there s an 8   5 million settlement for a libel suit against kelly s mother   theresa russell      there s the ambiguous cop   kevin bacon   who also executive produced   who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit   murder and lust    we   the audience   sniff something not so lustful    like so many thrillers these days   including   the usual suspects   and   the game       wild things   eschews character for plot    mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera   and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease   as if he knows the territory he s covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany   henry     a furious   unsettling film directorial tour  de force    george clinton s score is a delight to behold    but it s the humans    the characters are mere devices for the   nasty   twists    what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving   almost unbearable   if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting   don t feel real or we don t care for them    not even the unintentionally funny moments work    the people in   wild things   are not so much people as they are caricatures    then there s the erotic content   which nearly earned the film an nc 17   for a sexless   badly edited   poorly lit menage a trois    and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country   kevin bacon s member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go    ironically   the wildest elements of   wild things   are not wild at all    
Neg, violence is bad    violence is ugly    violence breeds yet more violence    kids   don t try this at home    this weighty message isn t the only barrier to enjoying brother   but it s certainly one of the largest    written   directed by   and starring the infamous takeshi kitano   kikujiro   sonatine   brother is his first film made outside his familial japan   bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles       yakuza translated for the average american is the japanese mafia      if you piss a   family   member off   or dishonor yourself in any way   the usual punishment is public display of self mutilation   usually resulting in the loss of limbs    a definition of dishonor can be anything from making a stupid decision to leaving one family for another    it would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs come from    unfortunately the film doesn t give too much of an explanation   assuming its audience is aware of kitano s earlier work    there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members   leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something   but you never know what    then there s a scene in which a man kills himself in front of a rival in exchange for that rival joining the family    granted   this is one of the best scenes in the movie   but it doesn t make a lot of sense    instead   the two hours are basically spent watching the following   people go out and shoot each other   talk about it for ten plus minutes   then go out and do it again    the consistently repetitive discussion of territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning    there are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose    all of the sudden yamamoto   kitano   has a girlfriend    he barely speaks to her   treats her like crap   and then sends her away    another missed opportunity   considering it is such a big deal for kitano to bring his magic to the united states   is the combination of cultures   which rely too heavily on overused stereotypes    though slow moving   brother does have good elements    the action scenes are well directed   clearly defined   and interesting to watch    some of the violence is more hinted at than shown   which produces the luscious squirm that one goes to see such films for    the actors would be more enticing if they had more to do    shirase s   masaya kato   loud   sarcastic coolness set against yamamoto s quietly threatening attitude is truly an entertaining combination    their moments together or apart steal the rest of the show    also to its credit   brother tackles the cause and effect of crime with realism    a life of crime is easy to get sucked into with the first reward of quick cash    sure people get rich   but they can also lose just as easily    it s a great moral   with a great cast   just not much substance to back it up    
Neg, do the folks at disney have no common decency    they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects   embarrassing writing and kid friendly slapstick    wasn t mr   magoo enough   people    obviously not    inspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment    younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness   but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80 minute exercise in glaring stupidity    the movie is poorly edited   grossly manipulative   and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle    all the elements are there   but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite    as a huge fan of the 80 s animated tv show   the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain    in the cartoon   dr   claw was a frightening   raspy voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer    we never saw his face   he simply sat back in his arm chair   watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat    as a child   i always imagined what dr   claw would appear as   and this curiosity kept me watching for many years    with the release of the live action movie   the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed   it s        rupert everett   !  only now   dr   claw is simply known as claw   `one word     he explains   `like madonna       he sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove   and seems far less interesting than the animated version    it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic   but he overplays the role entirely too far    when all is said and done   this wasn t a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters   the infamous dr   claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool    he does still have his cat   though    in the title role   matthew broderick looks lost    the actor   while usually downright charming   doesn t know exactly where to take his character   a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers    broderick first plays a friendly   naive security guard named john brown   who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the people    he has a mad crush on pretty scientist brenda   joely fisher     who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics    but one fateful night   her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire   everett   who wants to take over the world    john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime   but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames    in a full body cast   he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda s work   a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys    and so is born inspector gadget    as bad as this movie is   it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes    broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget   an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city    and there are about two or three amusing punch lines   the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall   and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming   `this is why i left tokyo !    alas   the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle    there are so many tired plot additions    gadget s talking car   voiced by d   l    hughley   is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian    both are wisecracking   non human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children    well   it just doesn t work   in fact   zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this      and don t even get me started about the villains    i didn t mind everett s performance   but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust    the characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles    penny   michelle trachtenberg   and brain the dog now have little to do with the action   and chief quimby   dabney coleman   has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action    the special effects are everywhere   but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over    the problem here lies solely in the script    perhaps the next time disney attempts a remake like this   they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy schmancy visuals    here is one critic crossing his fingers   anyway    
Neg, fantastically over hyped   godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen    the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands   then an attack on a boat from some beast   and finally we join dr   nick tatopoulos   broderick looking about 17 years old   doing some research in chernobyl    some shady u   s government guys appear   and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints   from what looks like a giant lizard    and what s more   this beast is heading for new york    gulp !  although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride   and at some points it is   there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie    the main faults lie with the acting and writing   common problems with  summer blockbuster  movies    broderick is pretty useless as the hero   with no humour or a  tough guy  image    while emmerich s previous summer flick   independence day   1996   had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith   this has neither    also   maria pitillo   as broderick s former girlfriend   is just as useless   with a chronic disability in acting    she s incapable of showing emotion   speaks every line in the same way   and basically she s total crap    it s up to french actor jean reno to save the day   and indeed he does   turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent    shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film    hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named  animal    and he adds a little life to the picture    also making an appearance is harry shearer   probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons   as a slimy news reporter    o   k   so the acting is not up to par   but it never is in these movies    but what about the script    well   that s not up to par either    emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script    the dialogue is banal   broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters  that s a lot of fish         and the character development is non existent   reno plays the typical frenchman    no croissant          broderick forever remains a geeky scientist      also   the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour    the jokes that are uttered are pathetic   and there s an  hilarious  running gag about siskel and ebert       the mayor is mayor ebert   and is assistant is called gene !  ha ha ha ha !      the plot is dire   and in the end just rips off jurassic park   1993   by having lots of baby godzilla s   i   e    velicorapters   running around new york    right   so the script and acting suck    but what about the special effects    thankfully   they re are quite good    godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi   although we don t see much of him because the movie is so dark    the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell    but although they are impressive   they can t save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie    the movie goes on for far too long aswell   and it can t seem to decide on a ending    and of course   the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel    let s just hope one never arrives

minutes    rated r   stars    had   hedwig and the angry inch   came out in the  70s   right after david bowie s   ziggy stardust     it likely would now be regarded as one of the most popular rock musicals of all time    released in the 500 channel   sensory overload world of 2001   however   the big screen adaptation of the acclaimed off broadway musical must do battle with countless other productions clamoring for attention    i almost missed it    every august   the major studios try to squeeze the last few dollars out of summer moviegoers by dumping all of their shakier offerings on the marketplace at once    i was so busy trying to keep up with national releases like   summer catch   and   bubble boy   that i passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a short local run    but an e mail from a reader asking why i hadn t reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the theater    thank goodness for readers like him       hedwig and the angry inch   is a gender bending glam rock spectacular packed with great songs    stylistically   the hook laden tunes are reminiscent of bowie     bat out of hell   era meatloaf and   the rocky horror show     without ever seeming like imitations    as with   tommy       hedwig   tells a story of isolation   pain and defiance   but without the bloated feel of that beloved   but overrated rock opera    writer director star john cameron mitchell and composer lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner    mitchell stars as hedwig   a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u   s   coffee shops with her pan slavic band   the angry inch    while the patrons of the run down restaurants look on in shock   and sometimes horror   hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song    she was once a boy named hansel   ben mayer goodman     living with his mother   alberta watson   and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio    life is an exercise in duality for hansel    a wall splits his hometown into two parts    mother describes love as the emotion that comes when you find your other half    as hansel grows up   the duality becomes more pronounced    after initially mistaking him for a girl   a gi from the states   maurice dean wint   falls in love with hansel and wants to marry him    alas   hansel will never pass the mandatory physical    mother helpfully suggests a sex change   but the operation goes bad   hence the references to   the angry inch     yes   i know this part is squirm inducing   but stick with me   it s worth it      several years later   mr   right is long gone and hansel becomes hedwig   decked out in a farrah fawcett style wig and fronting a band made up of korean women    hedwig finds a new love in tommy   michael pitt     a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity    but tommy does hedwig wrong   stealing her songs and becoming a superstar    cut to the present    tommy gnosis  stadium tour is thriving and hedwig is suing him    despite warnings from her manager   andrea martin   that she could easily be labeled a stalker   hegwig and her new band   the angry inch   continue their coffee shop tour   shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in    if this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical   take a few seconds and consider the plotlines of   tommy   and   rocky horror      as hedwig   john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and turning her into a compelling human being    mitchell has world class style and vocal chords to match    even though the backstory is unusually strong   mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost a rock musical    everything is propelled by one terrific song after another and   trust me   these are full fledged rock songs   not the over processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals    while mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film   there is much of interest on the sidelines    miriam shor does fine work as yitzhak   hedwig s lover and bandmate   conveying a great deal through expressions alone    decked out in a bandanna and a surprisingly convincing beard   she makes a mighty attractive man    as always     sctv   veteran andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy   the angelic appearing little rat    artist emily hubley adds to the magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining the central themes of the musical       hedwig and the angry inch   surrounds a weird   funny and touching story with a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast    true originals do not come along very often   don t let this slip out of town without seeing it    
Neg, jean claude van damme movies tend to be   if nothing else   a lot of mindless fun    his latest film     knock off     skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is   well   simply mindless    you can t really blame van damme    no one   i suspect   has ever expected   the muscles from brussels   to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray    and even his sidekick co star     saturday night live   alumnus rob   makin  copies   schneider   does what s expected of him   although neither appear to want the role of straight man    no   the problem with the film is its direction    the first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible        and it goes downhill from there !  five hundred characters   it seems   are introduced within the first fifteen minutes    van damme doesn t land his first kick until after thirty  too late for most action fans  and by the time the hour mark has rolled around   your jaw will be on your cup holder and you ll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess    director hark tsui   whose previous film was the van damme/dennis rodman teamed   double team     films at such a frenetic pace that it s hard to know what s going on   who s on whose side   and what the point of all this is    faster than you can yell   fruit stand !    we re watching a crazed rickshaw race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme    when schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind with a four foot eel while enthusing   move your beautiful big ass     the movie takes an unprecedented turn to the bizarre    every now and again   knock off   will deliver some truly ingenious directorial flourishes  inventive camera shots and angles   wild rides down gun silencers and from the tops of buildings to the sprawling street below   revealing cut ins within the frame  but they all happen too quickly   and within such a furious frame of reference   that they re wasted    if only hark could have slowed things down just for a minute    if you re interested in the plot   you re better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the on screen shenanigans     jean claude van damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers a russian mafia plot to terrorize the world with   nanobombs   hidden in cabbage patch knock offs    maybe    with paul sorvino      a more accurate summary would be   jean claude van damme bums around hong kong failing to avoid large   blatant coca cola product placements      the fact that the film is staged during hong kong s last days under british rule gets some lip service but doesn t figure in at all    perhaps   knock off    s most intriguing credit is that ron and russell mael composed the frenzied music score    some of you might remember the mael brothers as the  80s synth pop duo sparks   their contributions here are as confused as the accompanying action     kimono my house   indeed !  like the cheap jeans and   pumma   sneakers manufactured in hong kong   van damme s latest is a real phony    
Neg, john boorman s   zardoz   is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own    not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d   wood jr   has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time    of course   wood s career can be explained by two things   he had no money and he had no talent    boorman   on the other hand   cannot court such excuses to explain   zardoz     or his follow up film   the equally awful   exorcist ii   the heretic        boorman obviously had a sizable budget   a matinee idol movie star   sean connery   in the lead role   and although you wouldn t know it from this film   boorman does indeed have talent    this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece   deliverance     1972     as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama   hope and glory     1987     the slightly over conceived arthurian epic   excalibur     1981   and the father son jungle adventure   the emerald forest     1985      his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination   but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste    if boorman is anything   he s ambitious   and when he succeeds   it s in grand fashion    unfortunately   the bigger they are   the harder they fall   and when boorman falls   the resounding impact can be heard for miles around       zardoz   is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies   an obsession of boorman s    his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even   the wizard of oz     a book which figures into the movie s plot    but   despite all this reaching   the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling    the events take place in the distant year 2293   but there is little of the typical futuristic movie ness to be found    in fact   things seems to have moved backwards   with people riding horses   shooting old style guns   and living in large victorian mansions    it s more middle ages than space age    the world of   zardoz   is divided into two distinct hemispheres   the outlands   where all the poor   pathetic people live   and the vortex   where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life    these immortals never grow old   they never engage in sexual activity   they possess psychological powers   and they live in a sort of quasi utopian marxist society where everyone is equal   and everyone contributes equally to the society    however   if one breaks the rules   that person is punished by being aged so many years    if someone breaks the rules enough   he or she is aged to the point of senility   and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals    one of the immortals   arthur frayn   niall buggy     a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face   is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed    like   the wizard of oz     he adopts a god like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head       this flying head is one of the movie s opening images   and it s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come      calling himself zardoz   frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators   whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can t procreate and take up more resources    from inside his giant   stone head   zardoz bellows seriously laugh inducting statements like     the gun is good    the penis is evil      that line alone is worth the movie s cult following    one day   an exterminator named zed   sean connery     sneaks into zardoz s flying stone   pushes frayn out   and goes back to the vortex    once there   the immortals label him a   brutal   and study him like a lab rat   taking great   perverse care in exploring his sexuality   which is a mystery to them    they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection   and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up    i say   hilarious   because that is exactly what   zardoz   is    it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so   he made this film with the straightest of faces   although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward   he didn t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming    just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles   he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper   a mane of hair braided halfway down his back   a wyatt earp style handlebar mustache   and a pair of thigh high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker    boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of   deliverance     which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green light this effort    he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera   including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth     2001       whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in   zardoz   besides the inadvertent humor    sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971   and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace    he got exactly that in   zardoz     and it s a wonder it didn t end his career    i m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements    is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life    is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing    or is it a social statement   something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates    karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary    come to think of it   maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip    people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy    
Pos, one of the best things about my job is that   every so often   a film still catches me by surprise       spy kids   certainly did    an adventure story aimed primarily at children   the movie is smart   zippy fun    the production neither panders nor talks down to its audience    the brother and sister at the center of the tale are believable   likable kids and their parents are   get ready for this   intelligent   capable and loving    bathroom humor is kept to a minimum and the numerous well staged action scenes avoid excessive violence    what a relief it is to be able to review an all ages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics    consider the other pg rated   family friendly   movie in theaters now       see spot run   has a mother going out of town   leaving her son with an idiot neighbor    body function humor abounds   including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop    what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film    the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process    at the hospital   the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn t bit off the other one   because two metal replacement balls would clack together    of course   the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells    somebody clue me in   when did genital mutilation become funny       spy kids   is a welcome antidote to the repellent   see spot run     using imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness    carmen   alexa vega   and her younger brother juni   daryl sabara   live in a beautiful seaside home with their parents   gregorio   antonio banderas   and ingrid cortez   carla gugino      mom and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children    what the kids don t know is that they are also former spies    once agents from different countries assigned to   erase   each other   they instead fell in love   married and retired to raise a family    needless to say   they get drawn back to the business    shortly into their first joint mission   they are captured and end up in the headquarters of fegan floop   alan cumming     a foppish hybrid of willy wonka and pee wee herman who hosts juni s favorite tv show    but there is evil behind the scenes   as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children    papa gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get it from him    back at home     uncle   felix   cheech marin   shows up to reveal mom and dad s secret to the kids    after a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stores   carmen and juni set off to find their parents and save the world   zooming through the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish   while a slew of wicked people   including teri hatcher   chase them    during the course of their adventures   they get to use jet packs   electroshock bubblegum and super computer sunglasses    they watch as secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with silly putty faces and used as background characters on floop s tv show    they deal with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms   legs and heads would normally be   why are the guards so ineffective    because they re all thumbs !    they move from one colorful locale to another   including a nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from   star trek      the storyline is silly and convoluted   but even at its most dense   it is easier to follow than either   mission   impossible   movie    director robert rodriguez     from dusk to dawn     maintains a frenetic pace   with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes    a bit less action and a little more character development would have been nice   but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family    alexa vega and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother and sister team   squabbling the way kids do   but coming together when it counts    antonio banderas and carla gugino are even better as the parents   they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes    even the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments   a virtual cloud backed chat between his character and juni is one of the best segments in the film    had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that   i would have enjoyed the film more   and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mc ubiquitous company      regardless     spy kids   is a hoot   offering fun for adults and children alike    and just think   they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle    
Neg, sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality    he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades   like twelve angry men   serpico or the verdict    but   in the same time   almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet s reputation    a stranger among us   1992 rip off of peter weir s witness   belongs to the latter category    the heroine of this movie is emily eden   melanie griffith     tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york    during one of such actions   her partner nick   jamey sheridan   got hurt and as a result   she becomes depressed    in order to help her recover   bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community    emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder    concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community   she decides to go undercover    that isn t easy   because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways    things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel   eric thal      using peter weir s formula isn t the greatest flaw of this film    even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent    but the worst insult to viewer s audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith    the author of this review never liked this actress very much   but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles    role of emily eden   unfortunately   isn t one of them    first of all   she can t pass for tough nypd street fighter   and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn t much better    screenplay by robert j   avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots   scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch      but   on the other hand   other actors are more convincing   lee richardson as an old rabbi   thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride     and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community    also   the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture    that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time    
Pos, the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy    but after diasappointing films such as   godzilla   and   fear and loathing in las vegas     it would be nice to see a really good film    but i doubt you could have expected this    the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen   and it deserves a spot on the   decade s best   list    there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim     yes   that s what makes this film great      the blend of peter weir s masterful   and in many ways brilliant   direction   peter biziou s stunning photography and jim carrey s performance is what makes this film work so fantastically    there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show    it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame   but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect    carrey has made a very wise choice    by playing mild mannered truman burbank   he allows himself enough room to be comical   and therefore not alienating his true fans   while still showing a vulnerable and human side    that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes    truman burbank was born to an audience of millions    he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show    everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians   led by the show s director   christof   played by ed harris      everyone in truman s life is an actor or an extra    they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe   people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in truman s life    but he is the only person that is not aware of it    the classification of the truman show may be tricky    the audience reacted to many of truman s revelations with laughter    i did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character    the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes   because what was happening to him   indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong    so is this going to end up labeled as a comedy    a drama    it really depends on the audience    but to me   the truman show was a touching   sad tale about the extents to which a corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others    but above all else   the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor   heart and scary realism    oscar predictions in june are pointless   but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of 1997   as originally planned   james cameron would be oscar less    
Neg, the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride   and it s sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics   both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year s finest films    so   naturally   when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found   this notion left me puzzled    it is a rare thing for a children s movie to be praised this highly   so wouldn t you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly   magical   piece of work    a tad bewildered   but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films   i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind   having great expectations for the film    looking back   i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater    believe me   i wanted to like babe   pig in the city    the plot seemed interesting enough   after the events that took place in the original   babe the sheep pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon    but after a fateful encounter with a water well   arthur hogget   james cromwell   who the movie could have used alot more of   has been rendered bed ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially    the only solution that his wife   magda szubanski   going from delightfully charming to downright annoying   can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair   i think   and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank   set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public      problem is   the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded   city     a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion    setting the main plot in motion   mrs   hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals   despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels    it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters   the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright    here is where the film took a wrong turn    up until this point   i had being having a rather enjoyable experience    the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs   hogget is accused of smuggling drugs    unfortunately   the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel   none of them being even one tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe    the main topic of discussion surrounding babe   pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children   and i believe it is    at one point   a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown    at other times   we are treated to surrealistic flash backs to mrs   hogget s full cavity search at the airport    in fact   the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing    however   that is   as they say   neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway    the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half   let alone entertain a child    another problem i found with the film was it s sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story    if you re going to make a darker and more sinister sequel   fine    it may not be my cup of tea   but at least it is a noble ambition    but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs   hogget swinging from wall to wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls    it just didn t feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining   and the same goes for the rest of the movie    
Neg,    tina ! ! ! fetch me the axe ! ! !    a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981   paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands    it wasn t just the film s disappointing box office performance    indeed   in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two   three   even six times    no   the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year    in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events   some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming     mommie dearest   the biggest mommie of them all !      executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn   but it was all too late    mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history    unfortunately   faye dunaway s energetic   at times ridiculously over the top performance is about the film s only redeeming feature    based on daughter christina crawford s trashy biography   mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother    if you believe this movie   it was a life was racked by obsession   lonliness   child abuse and rampant egomania    the film begins with crawford adopting two children   and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother s will    joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves   you see    but that s about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film s end    the script   laboured over by four writers   a bad sign in itself   is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum    frank perry s direction is no more than competent   and dunaway s bitchy lines aside   the dialogue is flat and uninvolving    in fairness   the film s second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters    when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling   joan visits and keeps in touch   not helping her financially but encouraging christina s own acting and career ambitions    crawford does seem to care about her daughter   but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain    you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers    ah   but there is dunaway s performance    and what a delicious piece of campery it often is    having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds   crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden    she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she s making    spotting a young tree she doesn t like the look of   she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line   tina ! !  fetch me the axe ! !    with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling    in the film s most outrageous scene   joan realises that some of her daughter s clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers    oh dear !  sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum   doesn t it    this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst     no       wire       hangers         ever ! ! ! !      and later   when the board of her late husband s company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship   she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring     don t fuck with me   fellas ! !      oh joy !  something of a camp classic   then   but if that s not you re cup of tea then mommie dearest doesn t have too much to recommend it    better you see the real crawford in the women   1939     mildred pierce   1945   or whatever happened to baby jane   1962      great films distinguished by great performances   and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perry s shrieking piece of tabloid froth    
Pos, a miracle of filmmaking     some like it hot   is a brilliant film   and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists    it is the pinnacle of writer director billy wilder s career   a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make    jerry   lemmon   and joe   curtis   are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig   trying to earn enough money to feed themselves    one night   as they re playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy   the place is raided    as it turns out   the owner   spats columbo   george raft   was ratted out by toothpick charlie   george e   stone      several weeks later   on valentine s day   jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage    eager to escape   the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid    the only catch     its a girls band    so josephine   curtis   and daphne   lemmon     make their way onto the train and go to florida    on the way there   they meet sugar kane   monroe     a bombshell singer who is looking for love    jerry and joe immediately fall for the singer   but there s two problems   1   they re in drag   and 2   millionaire osgood fielding   joe e   brown   falls madly in love with daphne    what follows in pure hysteria   still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the   italian opera lovers festival      tony curtis is hysterical as joe/josephine   especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar    marilyn monroe   in a wonderfully comic performance   is sugar   providing incredible timing and sex appeal   along with true sincerity    the scenes   however   are all stolen by either brown or lemmon    lemmon is hysterical as daphne    cast as the less rational one   lemmon s performance is ridiculously crazy   it is disorder in the style all billy wilder s    brown is particularly hilarious as osgood   as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony    he manages to use lemmon s ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire    every set piece is flawless   as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly   and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture    wilder s script is stunning   as he carefully combines gangsters   cross dressing   romance   sex   music   gender roles   and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness    wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria   so pitch perfect that the audience is dying of laughter with the last comic piece   the final line of this absolutely incredible film    wilder s is dead wrong when he says nobody s perfect   billy wilder is   especially when he makes something this disastrously funny    nobody s perfect but billy wilder    
Pos, armageddon   in itself   symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking    stories have been replaced with special effects   character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue   plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up    armageddon is as stupid   as loud and as shallow as any movie you ll see come out this summer   or maybe even any other summer    but i loved every freaking minute of it    believe me   i m just as shocked as you are    hell   i don t even know why i went to see it in the first place    the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year   or at least in the running    i m sorry   but   somebody dial 911 ! ! !    isn t quite the tagging that s going to sell a movie    it isn t too wise either to market the film using the movie s stupidest lines     beam me up scotty     yeah   that sure is great writing            i mean   let s face it   armageddon s previews rival the truman show s as being some of the worst of the year    neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice    of course   you all know the story    when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas   nasa calls in the us s top oil drillers   !   to go into space   !   and implant a nuclear device eight hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid   !      in the coarse of all this mayhem   we are introduced to some interesting   and not so interesting   characters    belonging to the former group is rockhound   steve buscemi     a horny little womanizing genius who s always full of wisecracks   even when flying into space at a huge amount of g s    also   there s the always cool as hell billy bob thornton as dan truman   the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers    he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13   only without the intensity and great lines to deliver    then on the flip side of the coin is the tired   contrived character of harry stamper   bruce willis   who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can t quite place     the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie    basically   that s about it    as i said   this is hardly a film about plot    it s another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden    case in point   nasa doesn t know that there is even an asteroid on it s way until eighteen days before impact   huh    another example   at one point in the movie   two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy    how pretentious is that       ! ! !  want another one    okay   before the oil drillers blast off into space   one of them starts singing   leaving on a jet plane     and soon   all the rest join in    did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture    but naturally   all this sappiness   melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin  time at the movies    and don t get me wrong   despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon   i still very much enjoyed it    so even if you don t win one of mcdonald s free tickets   it s still definitely worth checking out    
Pos, as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on d day   the weary   seasick soldiers take a deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat    they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen    one man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck    as the flap falls   the battle begins    they are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire    amid the chaos of this massacre   stands a shot that   at least for me   hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindler s list    a soldier   clearly missing an arm   wanders around the body strewn beach like a lost puppy    we are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it himself    he bends over   picks up his arm and starts to carry it   probably not bothering to ask himself     what now      saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film    the direction is out of this world   surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar    the cinematography   by janusz kaminsky   is also astounding    but be forewarned   this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen    the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified   saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get    the question is     does the story and its realism justify the excessive use      the answer from my point of view is   no      braveheart was a truly gritty   and   one would imagine   realistic battle film    ryan is ten times worse    expect disembowelments   sucked in skulls   heads blown to bits   arms and legs flying across the battlefield    many in the theater could not bear to watch    and it is a shame   too   because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year    but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters   and academy members      saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on d day   1944   through into the film s primary mission    captain miller   hanks   assembles an 8 man crew and sets off to find a missing solider   private ryan   whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield    the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs   ryan doesn t recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons   that no person should suffer such injustice    miller s crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan   though they don t yet know him    they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesn t have any more or less right to live than any of them    this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and   though there is a lot of set up between battles   the story continues full speed to the end    the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it s own    spielberg   though not a student of the   quick cut   school of filmmaking   takes a stab at it here   and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it    bay should pay close attention   take copious notes    if you want to jump cut every two seconds   do it the way spielberg does it in ryan    in the end   the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the   importance   of the film    schindler s list taught many people the truth about the holocaust    it opened eyes   sparked debate and study    though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before   they don t amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler s list    overall   this is just the truest depiction of the old adage     war is hell      but braveheart dosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately   and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again    masterful work marred only by excessive gore    
Neg, by the numbers   a film which introduces characters   situations   dilemmas and developments that we ve seen before in a parade of other films    a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one    a film which is packed to the cap with predictability   leading to very little tension   excitement   suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience    in short   a clich    ridden formula film    welcome to my review of the general s daughter    plot   an undercover army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughter s rape   torture and murder    they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hush hushes   to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder    critique   by the numbers   see above      this film is just there    it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours   floats around   goes away   hopefully never to be heard from again    it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away    it s as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree    it s as action packed as a canadian curling tournament    get the picture    i sure did       it s  too bad that it took my friend and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot   and to break down each scene before it was even completed    easy as pie    it s unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film   but alas   t was not to be   that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted      woods chews it up in the few scenes that he s in   travolta passes the test   cromwell plays   well   cromwell   and stowe is window dressing with a smile   mia since 12 monkeys   8/10   it seems      and this predictability isn t reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men   it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen    it s like riding a bike    other scenarios which sponge out any tension   suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually   breaking down   to the investigators without much reason given   a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters   as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly   and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the   best poor man s michael bay doing his best poor man s impression of tony scott     add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half open shades for grit and integrity   and an all out rainfall for the finale for further chaos   and you re a great director    yawn    yeah   whatever tony       i  mean   simon      and aren t we all sick of hearing about these army   bad boys   and their overdone   code of silence     !  enough already !  next subject   please    see it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing a much better movie like an officer and a gentleman   8   5/10      otherwise   save yourself the trouble and go take a crap instead    you ll feel much better afterwards    trust me    little known facts about this film and its stars   ironically   john travolta turned down the lead role in an officer and a gentleman   which eventually went to little dickie gere    ironically on james woods  part   he completed one of his earliest acting roles on tv s   welcome back   kotter     starring none other than john travolta    actor james woods recently confirmed reports of his   big dick   on howard stern s radio program    unlike rocker tommy lee   woods is also alleged to have an iq of 180    he apparently scored a perfect 800 on his verbal sats and a 779 on the math section    what a man !  john travolta is married to actress kelly preston   and they have a son named jett   travolta loves them planes !      word on the street is that the kid was apparently conceived during a weekend at demi moore and bruce willis  home    director simon west s first film was the jerry bruckheimer produced con air   6   5/10      before that   he directed tv commercials including the budweiser ad with the dancing ants    yippee !  veteran director john frankenheimer   ronin   7   5/10      the manchurian candidate   portrays the character of general sonnenberg in this film    the imdb reports that when senator robert kennedy was shot at the ambassador hotel in los angeles on june 5   1968   it was his good friend john frankenheimer who had personally driven him there that day    clarence williams iii   who plays colonel fowler in this film   is known to some from his role as   linc   in the original   mod squad   tv series    younger folk may remember him as prince s father in purple rain    
Neg, can you say   dated      you can if you ve seen rosemary s baby which   like the exorcist   was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release       mystery science theater 3000   has skewered the bad films of the past   but let me tell you   it could do a number on the   good   ones too    rosemary s baby stars mia farrow   from the time she was actually good looking   as an innocent housewife and her not so innocent husband   john cassavettes     an actor who takes an easy   albeit evil   road to success    it all seems so harmless in the beginning    mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed       there s also a skull in the living room   but it s only for decoration      their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming    all s well for about the first hour of this slow moving film   until mia eats some of the neighbors  chocolate mousse and passes out    when she comes to   she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big   evil man raping her    a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen    it seems like a dream and   when she finds herself pregnant   she almost forgets about it    and everyone s helping with the pregnancy    the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink   a good luck charm for her to wear around her neck   and the name of an obstetrician who s been in the business 66   6  years    meanwhile   mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight    before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries    that s when you know your health s failing    the only person in the movie who s the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend   maurice evans   who calls mia up to give her the bad news    and immediately falls into a coma    by about the two hour mark i felt the same way    rosemary s baby is way too long   and leads up to a payoff that s about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie    i guess someone put a spell on this movie    
Neg, don t let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare    no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work   and this movie makes a vain attempt at that    any moves to   glamorise  his life   which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do   will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness    this movie about his life   although well written   puts too much make up on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes   rather than lobster and champagne    oh well   let s fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious play write   who falls in love with a beautiful woman   gwyneth paltrow   and from her inspiration   several plays develop     romeo and juliet    and   the twelfth night     it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and that s how all his plays develop   but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama    but i guess my version probably wouldn t draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen    so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare   when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul    i think not    as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie    i think not    in many aspects   private ryan  and   life is beautiful  were far superior movies   but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar   as time and again   for reasons unexplained   an undeserving movie will win the accolade    another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead   over a more polished cate   but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised   people will start feeling sorry for you    
Pos, i think that any competent member of the human race who s ever seen a movie  any movie  could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer    even though i try very hard to not predict films as i m watching them   especially not romantic comedies     the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds   and sometimes minutes   before i actually saw it happen on screen    but i don t care    not even a little    my reasons for this are simple   1   adam sandler is great    2   drew barrymore is great    3   the movie is so funny    there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard    i haven t laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers    sandler plays robby hart   a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music    in the opening scenes   he seems like a happy go lucky wedding singer   at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual   steve buscemi   who decides that his brother s wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life   up to that point   was utter pointlessness    a week later   at his own wedding   he is left standing at the altar by his ex fianc   e   linda   angela featherstone      with his life in complete disarray   he meets julia   barrymore     a waitress    she is engaged to glenn   matthew glave     and is to marry him in about three months    julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans    soon   and predictably   it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk   and that robby and julia really love each other    oh sure   it s trite    and if anyone making this film expected us to   like   feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer   then they truly underestimated their audience    what makes the story bearable   aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music   are the performances    barrymore is simply adorable here   i ve never seen her look so close to the way she did in et      not only is she pleasant to look at   but her acting job here really is a good one  and it doesn t hurt that the character is likable and adequately well written    and the jerk   played in full force by graves   is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i ve ever seen    naturally   the true star here is sandler    i think the guy is flat out hilarious    he can say something that just isn t funny   and his delivery makes me laugh    his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore   but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can   indeed   hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy    whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler   the wedding singer gives him a character that   for the first time   he actually has to fit into    as far as i m concerned he succeeded   and this film is testimony that he does   in fact   have some range in his talents    and the movie is just so funny    perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc   e abandoned him    this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air    and while the film   like all romantic comedies   takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up   there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half    my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren t very important    the film is predicable   but who cares    the characters are extremely likable   the movie is ridiculously funny   and the experience is simply enjoyable    in addition to this   i can t imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film    in that order   i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review    i just want everyone to know that i laughed    a lot    
Pos, imagine this    you re given a sword and a shield and very basic   minimal training    a man you don t know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live    you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die    you frantically monitor several closed doors which   in seconds   will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you    you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood    if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you   you know you re going to have to do it all over again tomorrow    eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are   you re going to die    this is the life of a gladiator    you ll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott s powerful gladiator   you ll be thankful for that    with his new film   scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire    and like those preceding it   spartacus and ben hur   gladiator has nearly everything going for it   a strong lead actor   a wonderful supporting cast   eye catching special effects   and a great script    since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator   teenagers to thirty year old males   were around   a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited    >from a weak beginning   the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious    rome s best general maximus   russell crowe     who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted   is currently   in the year 180 a   d   that is   waging a war against germania    scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style   similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective    it s blurry   in slow motion   and the sound is muted    as soon as this artistic method began   it was hard to tell what was what and who was who    it s a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch    instead   the general swears he will get out after this battle    he wants to go back to his family and his crops   he wants a quiet life    but   unexpectedly   he gets anything but that    the dying emperor of rome   marcus aurelius   richard harris     decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies    he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators    all of this does not go well for aurelius  son   commodus   joaquin phoenix   who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor    jealous and upset   commodus kills his own father   names himself emperor   kills maximus  wife and son   and attempts to kill maximus    but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius  wishes    now a slave   the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator   who eventually are released for their success    a story of betrayal and promises   gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick    you actually care about the characters   sometimes even the evil villain commodus   who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way    phoenix plays his character brilliantly    think of commodus as the percy wetmore   of pant wetter the green mile   of the roman empire   a whiny   sleazy     respect me because my father was a good man   brat who hates when he s not the center of attention    every scene we see commodus   he s either crying or he looks like he has just been crying    phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for   and gladiator shows he s more than just river s little brother    crowe is also excellent as the film s grisly faced hero    maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions    this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act   he s no invincible superhero who only blurts out one liners   he   believe it or not   acts like a human being !  the rest of the cast   including richard harris   djimon hounsou   walter hill   derek jacobi   and connie nielsen are also first rate    ridley scott   using outstanding special effects   has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum   the loudness of the roman mob   and the city of rome in general    the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous   like a cleopatra of the year 2000    the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper class politicians    gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience    along with u 571   action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000    
Neg, in life   eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison    after about an hour of watching this movie   you begin to realize how their characters feel    fortunately   for audience members there s a chance to escape the nearest exit    this   undoubtedly   is eddie murphy s worst movie and that s an accomplishment    remember the golden child   harlem nights    compared to life   they look like citizen kane    life is long   predictable   foul mouthed and only intermittently funny    its 100 minute running time feels like 100 years    robert ramsey and matthew stone s script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring to everyone around them as   motherf       s   or   n            s      you lose count how many times both those obnoxious   offensive words are used    and if that all it takes to write a script   than any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor and compose a movie    but   like life   it will probably stink    to be honest   the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up    but these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well    life is as sophisticated as a belch    it s crude and stereotypical    years ago   movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient   second class people   good for being only maids and servants    for the most part   the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved    but a new   more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies    in many recent films   through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers   blacks are presented as fast talking   conniving   scam artists or hip hop   gun crazy   sex crazed youths    both sets of caricatures are demeaning    and the fault does not rest with the actors    they have to eat   too    it is with the people who write the scripts   the studios who green light the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest    life s only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into 90 year olds    otherwise   life is an embarrassment   a blot on the resumes of those associated with it    see it at your own risk    
Neg, it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire    usually   you had to be an aristocrat   a count such as dracula or karnstein    to qualify   you d have to have a modicum of sophistication   so you d at least look cool   or suave   when biting into some young damsel s throat    but today   in our overly politically correct world   any scuzzy looking   long haired   unshaven lout or any spiked haired harridans can put the bite on you    by the same token   to be a vampire hunter   one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier   or at least one who retired with honors    not in these times    all you need are some sharp weapons   some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy   or a blade    without sounding elitist   the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity    which brings us to blade   the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which   it seems   half the population is putting the bite on the other half    not only are there thousands of vampires   but they seem to move from city to city   pay off police departments and   most importantly   establish their own exclusive after hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower    with all that blood   you wonder why they have to hunt for victims    you also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains    blade   which is based on a marvel comic book character   is   like a comic book   all visual    the plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader   deacon frost    it s all hokum and nonsense   of course    but the filmmakers play it straight    unfortunately   at least at the advance screening i attended   the audience didn t see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings    you know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter    another tell tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero s costume more than the hero    also it seems it s not enough for today s vampire merely to have fangs    he must also be proficient in the martial arts    why a supernatural being   one of the undead   needs such skills is beyond me       of course   this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires   in which dracula is defeated by seven karate chopping siblings      wesley snipes is buff as blade    he growls his lines  the few he has   and spends most of the time glowering   as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co producing this turkey    blade is just another example of how the vampire film   a once honorable member of the horror family   has gone downhill    this dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face    today s vampires lack the panache   the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee    they are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers  capes    they are more farcical than frightful    this whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening    
Neg, kids today   they don t just want to see heartthrob and master thespian freddie prinze jr   loving on the ladies    no   they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting department   namely   playing baseball    through a series of drippy voiceovers   we are informed that there s no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues   where college also rans and hopeful dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention    our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham a s   where he is hoping for his big break    it s only after he is given ample time to show off his abs and scamper about in a woman s thong   don t ask   that we learn what the real story of summer catch will be   that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne   struggling to make a name for himself   that neither his father   fred ward   nor brother   jason gedrick   pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs and resent anyone who tries   and that the local beauty tenley    tenley !     jessica biel      is so far out of his league that he probably shouldn t even bother        but of course he makes a play for her    summer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots    the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee   brittany murphy     the alienation felt by ryan s non baseball playing best friend   gabriel mann     or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles   marc blucas      worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that  70s show s wilmer valderrama and beverly d angelo   both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs   robinson like substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham    in fact   virtually all of summer catch feels like it s been done better somewhere else    for starters   the film has a major question of identity    it s definitely not a sports movie   and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance    the worst part is the amateurish script   co written by an arli$$ writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3     chock full of phony emotion    by the end   it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart    dad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice    coach   brian dennehy   just loving the fact that he s got some work on the big screen   is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint    ryan s catcher   matthew lillard   playing himself again   is on hand to tell ryan to   play catch   with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy    ryan s stoner best friend is on hand to give the go get  em tiger we re behind you talk    and the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarming nuzzly follow your dreams counsel    before long   you start to wonder   is freddy prinze jr   is capable of having a thought of his own    don t answer that    the only real joy in the film is found in biel s character   and not just because of the skimpy outfits   which are also usually wet    she s the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role   taking the rebelling against daddy character to at least a passing grade    when she s on screen   the time flies by    when she s not   you realize that for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long    for a pg 13 teen romance   despite near constant sexual innuendo     one has to ask warner brothers   what were you thinking        for her part   biel has fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards    hollywood is either about to eat her alive        or vice versa    either way   good luck   jessica    as for freddie   if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year   prinze s next   summer catch   is liable to be a venereal disease    
Neg, m   i 2   the sequel to mission impossible   is a james bond wannabe film   but it fails to even come close to that film in wit   humor   and entertainment value    it tries to be a spy/romance movie   but without any suspense the film just looks like it s an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses    it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human    the coolest thing about this movie   was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie   was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols    the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence    except for the choreographed action sequences   the film was dull for three quarters of its time   filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed    as for the action scenes   they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films   but their advertisement for sadistic responses   is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence   which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen    m   i 2 opens and closes with fast paced action scenes   but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue    the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus   at that point    the only thing that kept me awake   was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film s supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way    it s a mega buck film adapted from a popular high tech gadgetry tv series    but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it   and it failed to produce a story that had any substance    john woo     broken arrow   /   face/off     is good at doing car chases   choreographed fights with midair flips and kung fu kicks   slo mo shots of two guns blazing   and of fire explosions   but he just can t seem to handle dialogue and suspense    the star of the film and co producer   tom cruise   and his romantic interest   thandie newton   are miscast    cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile   as he tries to carry off this macho role   while thandie is not an action film girl   and seems like a fish  out of water in this one    their romance didn t work   not only was it tepid and not sexy   but it wasn t convincing    the film opens with dizzying speed   perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success    we will be in three different locations instantaneously   sydney   the american southwest   and seville    first   we are in sydney   australia   where a scientist with a muffled russian accent   dr   nekhorvich   rade     mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it    he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain    which explains the film s mythic theme       as  we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil    the one who played the villain   dougray scott   does so in a one dimensional gruff tone   which did not distinguish him in that role    at least   if the film got the villain part right   it might have had some fun with this nonsense    soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri   but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains    before they crash the plane and parachute out of it   the one who was posing as dimitri   turns out to be sean ambrose   scott     a rogue member of the imf   which is a cia like clone    he steals the package with the antidote   peels off a latex mask   which is a replica of the hero of the story   ethan hunt   cruise     who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust    sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices    we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible   which as convoluted a plot as that film had   it was still a superior film to this sequel    woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground   as it is used so often in this film by both sides   so much so   that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain    it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character   which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense    next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest   and ethan is on vacation   hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool   when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard   delivers via a rocket launcher   a pair of talking sunglasses    hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help   billy baird   john polson   and luther stickell   ving rhames     with luther running a high gadget computer   but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall   thandie   to join his team    he is told   as an incentive to recruit her   all her criminal charges will be dropped    hopkins then signs off with the tag line   this message will self destruct in five seconds    actually   with the departure of hopkins   it was this disposable film that actually self destructed at this point    in seville   hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase   where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road    he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal   and learns that she is valuable because her ex boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her    the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him   as she leads them to his hide out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort   the south african   hugh stamp   richard roxburgh      robert towne   the screenwriter   who contributed to the first   mission     who is noted for doing   chinatown      writes a colorless   pedestrian script   one that fails even to be funny in a camp way    the terrorists   who aim to rule the world   are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options   as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote   insuring that they will make billions on the stock    ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah   with his only conflict being who is more important to save first    ethan does this rescue against all odds   as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company   fight it out with sean and the other terrorists   and rescue nyah   who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean s getting it   as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle    ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle   using kick boxing   winning a shootout   throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists   making some more use out of that peeling mask bit   and by being completely fearless and larger than life   while he kick s everyone s ass    if i was only entertained by this       i  could have lived with it    but this film was so badly made   that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game   seeing only the slam dunks   but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast    in any case   this is a critic proof film   and will in all probability do well in the box office   as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into    
Pos, making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed   especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece    when it comes to living up to expectations   a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure    for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original s greatness is very rare indeed    and whereas   babe   pig in the city   misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe   it is a worthy companion piece    more than that   it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right       babe   pig in the city   warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like   the godfather   part ii   and   the empire strikes back   as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced       babe   pig in the city   picks up precisely where   babe   left off    having won the sheep herding competition   farmer hoggett   james cromwell   and his pig are elevated to fame status    a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs   hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city    in doing so   the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original       babe   pig in the city   flourishes where so many sequels fail    most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film    not   babe   pig in the city      this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first    also   by not being content to utilize most of the old characters   this film gives us many new ones to enjoy    in essence   it doesn t attempt to copy itself    instead   it strives to achieve an originality of its own    and it succeeds    that s not to say the familiar is absent       babe   pig in the city   retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film    along with babe himself   ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride   as does mrs   hoggett   one of this decade s best and most underappreciated comic characterizations   hilariously performed by magda szubanski      the three singing mice also make the journey   chiming in with their cute high pitched vocals    the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice    from there   we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne s soothingly deep narrative    composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these    but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting    while staying at the flealands hotel   babe encounters a veritable ark full of new animals    monkeys   kittens   and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new   urbanites   that babe befriends   as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter    each character is distinctly unique   some of which are imbued with personal human like struggles that are endearing and touching    and while this world focuses largely on these animals   we are introduced to two new human characters as well    mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel   an animal loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors    stein s landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature    we also meet fugly floom   an old soft spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel   utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions    not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film   it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was    so as not to ruin this well kept secret   i won t reveal the actor s identity here    it was a treat indeed to see one of cinema s legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance    the greatest triumph of   babe   pig in the city   is the art direction    simply put  it bleeds creativity   taking the look of the original film to a whole new level    restricted primarily to a farm the first time around   this second installment creates an entire city   dazzling us with unique fable like architecture    but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world s architectural landmarks    designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty   the sydney opera house   the brooklyn bridge   the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower   ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities   as seen in the film photo and pre production drawing to your right      added to that   many of this city s streets are the twin siblings of venice s gondola trekked rivers    the metropolis that has sprung from ford s vision is a wondrous sight to behold    it is a world that you want to walk around in    norma moriceau s costume designs belong in this world   vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford s landscape    most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish   with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom s clown outfit    andrew lesnie s photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film s multiple emotional tones    much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of   babe   pig in the city      reports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg 13 rating    these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating    but even so   to be anything harsher than the original  s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms    by deleting a minimal number of shots     babe   pig in the city   was eventually given the coveted g rating    although appeased   many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark   fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself    well   to coin a phrase   the reports of   babe   pig in the city    s death at the hands of a dark   scary   felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated    granted it has its moments of pseudo morbidity   but all in all   babe   pig in the city   is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be    whatever   dark   moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller   the   mad max   trilogy     the witches of eastwick       lorenzo s oil        having served as a producer and co writer on the first film   miller moves into the director s chair for this one   putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise    the story of   babe   pig in the city   is an enchanting yarn   but one that doesn t achieve the emotional or character depth of the original    missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity   an individual s worth   challenging conformity   and one s purpose in life       babe   dealt with this weighty subject matter   creating a timeless fable       babe   pig in the city   should not have rehashed these themes   but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones    this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife   class differences   sacrificial courage   and so on    but this film s goals aren t as lofty as the first s   instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach   allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting   sometimes intense   fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive       babe   pig in the city   also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film   specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe    hoggett s love for babe   which grew ever so gently   is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality    best exemplified in hoggett s dance for babe   this moving relationship was truly unique    it is something that i wish would have been present again   and could have through fugly floom     but was not    please understand   these are not negative criticisms   per se    but simply statements of what i see as the differences between   babe   pig in the city   being a very good film and the original being a great one    but having said that   these observations are minor critiques at best    as an overall piece     babe   pig in the city   is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end    sure   it isn t a great film   but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness    it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor   exciting in its adventurous exploits   funny with its dry wit and cute voices   and breathtaking in its presentation       babe   pig in the city   may not be moviemaking at its absolute best   but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema    as a result   if you choose to let this film pass you by   you will be missing of the year s best cinematic treats    
Neg, my giant begins with a monologue that s more funny than not and a distinctive `princess bride     medieval fairy tale in the    90s feel    i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was   with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy   billy crystal   is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream    and when sammy meets max   his giant   mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan   there is magic in the air   albeit it a bit goofy   i loved every minute of it    the film   of course   plays on the size difference between the two   and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects    i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons    i also liked jere burns    from tv s `something so right    performance as the director of the film in romania    at this point   the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand   particularly during his fast paced first scene    it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate   as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech    however   about the time muresan becomes coherent   the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive    off the high board    suddenly   we are expected to believe sammy is a do whatever it takes slime ball    up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure   but he didn t come off as a desperate jerk    if he had   the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical    but now   in new york   we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son   and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs   midgets wrestling match   which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film    indeed   many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces    this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal   when sammy gets max a role in a big   hollywood movie filming in las vegas    while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself   the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation   rather than because the film demanded it    and the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare    at this point i found myself thinking   `we re supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film      then i realized he was   and i was watching it    in the final third   the film undergoes another transformation   this time to unbridled sentimentality    note   major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph    max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love   lillianna   who hasn t seen him since he was a normal sized kid    her refusal to see max   unbeknownst to him   leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means  scene as sammy s wife serena   played nicely by kathleen quinlan   poses as lillianna    i found this scene offensive    not only did it rely on deception to induce warm   fuzzy feelings from the audience   it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle   which i thought was quite undeserved    i think max could have handled the truth   gratuitous illness and all    late in the film we learn max   and in fact all giants   have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably    this could be an enlightening revelation   but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy s transformation into a caring   sensitive guy    and hey   a great dad and husband   too !  `my giant  suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions    a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max s struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy s struggles to get money and become a better person    in this scenario   max s illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator    sentiment and emotion would have followed naturally    instead   we re apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end   but we re not allowed to focus on max    crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances   but in the end   `my giant  left me feeling like i d been fed gruel from a giant spoon    
Neg, ripe with explosions   mass death and really weird hairdos   tsui hark s   double team   must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jean claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie bedpost and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career    actually   in   double team     neither s performance is all that bad    i ve always been the one critic to defend van damme    he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars   namely steven seagal   never aim for   it s just that he s never made a movie so exuberantly witty since 1994 s   timecop      and rodman        well   he s pretty much rodman    he s extremely colorful   and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t   even if the role is that of an ex cia weapons expert    it s the story that needs some major work    van damme plays counter terrorist operative jack quinn   who teams up with arms dealer yaz   rodman   to rub out deadly gangster stavros   mickey rourke   all beefy and weird looking   in an antwerp amusement park   the job is botched when stavros  son gets killed in the gunfire   and quinn is taken off to an island known as   the colony      a think tank for soldiers   too valuable to kill   but   too dangerous to set free      quinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife   natacha lindinger     but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her    so   what s a kickboxing mercenary to do    quinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman   kill stavros   save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do    with crazy   often eye popping camera work by peter pau and rodman s lite brite locks     double team   should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure    but too much tries to happen in each frame   and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated    the numerous action scenes are loud and headache inducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what s going on in the movie    and much of what s going on is just wacky    there s a whole segment devoted to net surfing monks that i have yet to figure out    and the climax finds quinn going head to head with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle   trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinn s baby boy   who s in a bomb equipped basket      all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers    did i mention   double team   is strange    when it all comes down   this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon   albeit one that feels no need to indulge in gratuitous profanity    rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona   though   leading up to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs    but we didn t need   double team   to tell us he could do that   did we    
Neg, several days after having seen this movie   i m still trying to determine what director christopher guest   a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate   found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes    this is a dreadful motion picture   a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs to jokes ratio    there s a kind of desperation in the movie s approach to humor that reveals the film makers  uncertainty about how entertaining the material is   the manic style betrays itself as a last ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script    the premise doesn t sound especially amusing to begin with   almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers   the effeminate leslie edwards   matthew perry   and the uncouth bartholomew hunt   chris farley     who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest    edwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies   albeit of the early 19th century variety     including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages   none of which prove to be useful     a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest   and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries    along the way   the intrepid explorers encounter bears   bald eagles   aging native american warriors   and a conquistador named hildago   kevin dunn   who raves about his beautiful hair    the explorers  trek takes them through forests   across the snow capped rocky mountains   and over a waterfall    this setup leads to a lot of shouting   a great deal of lunacy   and very few laughs    farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing   but   aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle   his heart doesn t seem to be in it    matthew perry   one of the stars of tv s friends   who had some modest success in the romantic comedy   fools rush in   is badly miscast    as a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy   perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man    i m not a big fan of david spade   and i didn t like tommy boy   but at least he and farley worked well together    as far as the supporting players go   none of them makes more than a fleeting impression    eugene levy is wasted   and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla    frankly   it s a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest   the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap   the big picture   and waiting for guffman    although guest gets the costumes right   this nearly inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution    the special effects   such as they are   are execrable    for an example of some really poor blue screen work   look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids   they re obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them   and where farley is being carried off by an eagle    even though farley didn t have the most stellar of acting careers   he doesn t deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes    while some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12 year old boys   the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric    farley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty   since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session    
Neg, weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg s reliance on formulas    saving private ryan  is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches    there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics    spielberg s greatest strength as a director is the polished   formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story    but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war   or the holocaust   this technique backfires   for it creates coherent   comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size   complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken    in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films     saving private ryan  tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a   pr mission   to pull a young man   ryan   whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere   out of combat on the normandy front just after d day    ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers    the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france    there s no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie    the equipment   uniforms and weapons are superbly done    the opening sequence   in which captain miller   tom hanks   leads his men onto omaha beach   is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat    another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg s brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences   such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers   the banality of death in combat   the routine foul ups in the execution of the war   and the cynicism of the troops    the technical side of the film is peerless   as always    the camera work is magnificent   the pacing perfect   the sets convincing   the directing without flaw    hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance   which was utterly convincing   and the supporting cast was excellent   though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel    yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events    it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film   or the story fails to convince    throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices   exception   men are shown burning to death with relative frequency      for example   we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground    here and there men lose limbs   in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety   there s an explosion   and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man    but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact    there are no shoes with only feet in them   no limbs scattered everywhere   no torsos without limbs   no charred corpses   and most importantly   all corpses have heads   in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds      the relentless dehumanization of the war   in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity   is soft pedaled in the film    ultimately    saving private ryan  bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war    rather than saying  saving private ryan  is   realistic     it would be better to describe it as   having realistic moments      another aspect of the   hollywoodization   of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular   the lack of swearing    anyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war   such as fussell s superb  wartime   understanding and behavior in the second world war    which has an extensive discussion on swearing     knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup       who is this private ryan that we have to die for him      asks one infantrymen in the group of eight    rendered in wartime demotic   that should have been expressed as   who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him      or some variant thereof    conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the   f   word   and largely about   the search for   food and sex    this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an   r   rating due to violence   so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film    however   the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic    the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg    he cannot just cede control to the material   he has to be bigger than it    as if afraid to let the viewer find their own   perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear   emotional foothold in the material   spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had   the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary   reminscent of the closing scene from  schindler s list     the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close   every bit as bad as schindler s monologue about how his car   tiepin or ring could have saved another jew     quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson   captain miller s last words to private ryan   and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain    that particular subplot is so hokey   so predictable   it nigh on ruins the film    nowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness   stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat   imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage      because of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii    saving private ryan  can only pan for small truths in the shallows        
Pos, when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy   he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space    it really is too bad that comedies are so hit  and miss   because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused   it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver    but weep not   dear readers   because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet    austin powers   the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i ve had the pleasure to see in a long time   a completely looney   delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks    if all comedies   or even half   or     what am i saying       even a fifth of them   could be this consistently hysterical   i would take up residence at my local multiplex    even more to this movie s credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers   international man of mystery    the original came out of nowhere   it was a low budget   eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody    all of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america    ironically   powers    yeeeeah baby   yeah !    has almost become an icon of the late 90s    thus another installment was inevitable   but it s also undoubtedly welcome    the spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained   over  the top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life    it brings back most of the characters from its predecessor   even if only briefly   and adds new ones    austin powers   mike myers     a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo   oh   you ll figure it out     which dr   evil   meyers again   has stolen    he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell   now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence     played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr   evil yet again    surprisingly   the real star is dr   evil rather than austin    he gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie    perhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately    instead of being the scheming   villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling   often sweet mad scientist wannabe    the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original   but that s okay by me because the original left us wanting more    by the time that one was over we haven t had nearly our share of shag jokes   crude puns and powers  antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites    even by its conclusions   i m still not sure i ve had my fill of bits like   do you smoke after sex         i don t know   baby   i never looked      this may seem awfully immature of me   but understand that the austin powers series   unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days   is genuinely funny    i don t know if i ve ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious   just the two of us   rendition by dr   evil and his new miniature clone named   mini me      i don t have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort    indeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did    but as far as i m concerned   that is enough       1999 eugene novikov &#137    
Pos, when i initially set out to review this film   my tag line was going to be   you too can believe whales can fly      then it was going to be   you too can believe pastel triangles can fly      then   it was going to be   you too can believe wood sprites can fly      finally   i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say        there s a lot of flying going on in this film !  as our first host steve martin tells us   the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in    well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while   because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released    part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940   grossing somewhere close to $110   000 in its original month of release      subsequent re releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved   and rightfully deserved      to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia   disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before   six stories high    in an exclusive four month engagement   from january 1st to april 30th   2000     fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us    after the engagement is over   the film will be shown at regular theaters    is the format effective for the film    with a few exceptions   yes    the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven s fifth symphony    it s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about   but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily    everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil   black bat like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts    eventually   shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat like things and peace returns to the butterfly things    though this segment isn t very story driven   some of the images are very visually strong   especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things   who are all outlined in blood red colors   begin to overtake the skies    the next segment is set to ottorino respighi s   the pines of rome      in this segment   some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape    a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack    he is finally saved   by another liberating shaft of light   and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the   oceans   of clouds    again   visuals are the key with this segment   especially where the whales are involved    reportedly the whales   as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences   are shown as actual size    the cgi whales look incredibly life like   except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images    one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent    absolutely beautiful stuff    the third segment   and the least of the eight segments   is set to george gershwin s   rhapsody in blue      this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld   and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york    there s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer   an out of work sad sack that dreams of having a job   a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm   and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife    i won t go into how everything works out   but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending    unfortunately   the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments    segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich s   piano concerto no   2   and is an animated version of hans christian andersen s   the steadfast tin soldier      a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind up clock ballerina   whom he assumes is also one legged because he can t see her other leg extended out behind her     much to the dismay of an evil jack in the box jester    the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina    little does the jester know   the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from    the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl    although the ending has been altered from the andersen story     the steadfast tin soldier   is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short    some children may find the jester to be a little frightening   but otherwise the segment is well made    segment five is the funniest of the bunch    set to camille saint saens   the carnival of the animals     this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number    while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia   it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy    segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia   and it s the one that people remember most     the sorcerer s apprentice      the story is the most recognizable   so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo    unfortunately   the segment wasn t made to be presented on large format film   considering it was shot full frame   and exhibits large amounts of grain    there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain    similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately   but no one seems to notice for some strange reason     an anomaly common to many 18 plus screen theaters    segment seven is set to sir edward elgar s   pomp and circumstance march no   1   and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character    donald duck   stars   as an assistant to noah   whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark    during the loading   donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn t make it on the boat    they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners    despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece   it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear jerkers foisted on audiences these days    powerful stuff    segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich     saving the best for last      set to igor stravinsky s   the firebird     an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape    trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation    when the sprite examines the formation   it awakens and becomes the titular firebird    in a stunning spectacle   the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path   including everything that the sprite has worked to create    some amazing animation is present here   and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone   although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film      the host segments are largely   no pun intended   throwaways   although steve martin s clip is pretty funny    be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin    penn and teller are usually funny   but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting    the best segment comes from   of all people   bette midler   who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board    pieces like flight of the bumblebee   a take on the four horsemen set to wagner s   ride of the valkyries     and a strange segment prepared in the  40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments    for fans of visual stimulation or classical music   fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon    the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material    as i mentioned earlier in the review   if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film   fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters    i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though    then you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly    [g]  
Pos, with the release of gattaca   i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens   or aliens in general    hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films   but what was usually lacking was a good story        and good characters        and good acting   etc   contact being the exception      and for some reason   hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth    the closest   that i have seen anyway   was 2001   a space odyssey   which made mankind an alien race themselves   being dwarfed by the technology which they created    now comes gattaca   another film about technology reigning supreme   except here on our planet    the difference between 2001 and this one is simple   gattaca is more frightening    most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering    using this premise   writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills    unfortunately   due to a lack of advertising   i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office    since seeing the film   i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca    lately   however   i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca    most people don t even realize that it is a film    despite this fact   i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it    niccol s film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter   better produced   and more realistic    gattaca begins in the 21st century    procreating is now done in a petri dish   and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it    natural child birth is considered old fashioned    we are introduced to jerome morrow   ethan hawke     an employee of the gattaca space program    one of the directors of the program has been murdered   and the main suspect is one vincent freeman    the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman    vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love    however   after his birth   and through several genetic tests   doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99% chance of a weak heart   as well as poor eye sight and a short life span    as a result   both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics    anton   loren dean   is produced without flaws   and the competition between brothers spawns    vincent has a dream to fly a solo flight around the titan   the 14th moon of saturn   but because of his condition   gattaca   and society in general   forces him to do menial labor around the company    labeled an   in valid     vincent s dream seems impossible   until he meets a black market dna specialist   german   tony shalhoub      german introduces him to a   valid   who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident    jerome morrow   jude law   agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools   urine   blood   skin and hair samples   etc     that he will need to get past gattaca s tight security    in exchange   vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship    after the murder   however   his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent s eyelashes left at the scene of the crime    irene cassini   uma thurman   is a genetically flawed   valid   working for gattaca   and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome    gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time    only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years   contact and the arrival   and gattaca will rank among them    unfortunately   whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects laden films   it normally gets buried    the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs    the orange glow of gattaca s scenes are impressive   but the sets deserve most of the credit    the sets are very well done   creating a futuristic sense   but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers    as we look at the designs   we realize that these buildings aren t too far into the future    this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day    the best thing   however   is the plot    the story is more than your average sci fi/thriller    at its heart   it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present    perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring    would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies    maybe human nature is a result of mankind s flaws    if we get rid of flaws   do we get rid of dreams as well    niccol s intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well   and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story   or vice versa    the power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters    while flat may sound like a poor job on niccol s part   it actually enhances the meaning behind the story    ethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor   giving his best performance of his lifetime so far    his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and   valid   peers    uma thurman is       well   uma thurman    her character is slightly underdeveloped   but the story isn t about her    however   thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character    jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character    he provides several nice touches   and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one    loren dean gives a nice performance in his well developed character    dean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie    alan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank    still   he does a good job    gore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles   and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film    gattaca is rated pg 13 for brief violent images   language   some sexuality   and nudity    despite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film   i wasn t exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty    it turned me off slightly   but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have    if this had been a typical hollywood film   it would have ended much differently    however   with all the mindless science fiction films out there   it is nice to have a film which doesn t talk down to its audience   i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding   g   t   c   and a      instead   it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want   a science fiction film with morals behind it    whatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining    hopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca        and hopefully audiences will too    p   s   personal note to p   j   gladnick   how dare you call this film the worst film of the year    i can t even begin to image what film you do like    that frightens me beyond anything    
Neg,    tarzan and the lost city   is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while    not only it is poorly written   badly acted   and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas   it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid    unfortunately   it s not bad in the way great   colossal misfires like   heaven s gate     1980   or   ishtar     1987   were bad    instead   it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with   which begs the question of why it was made in the first place    with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un produced   how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen    of course   tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history   he has appeared in over forty films   which have ranged from the very good   1984 s   greystoke   the legend of tarzan   lord of the apes     down to the really bad   1981 s   tarzan   the ape man   with bo derek      most of these films were just cheapie b movies made in the thirties and forties   starring ex olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps    therefore   if another tarzan movie is to be made   one might assume that it would have something new to offer   a different angle   an original storyline   anything to set it apart from all the others       greystoke   added a never before seen level of realism to the pulpy tale   and even   tarzan   the ape man   at least had the mis guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek s bare breasts       tarzan and the lost city     on the other hand   has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue    the script   by bayard johnson and j   anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come    comic books have better plots than this    the movie is so bad   in fact   that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer s comedy   george of the jungle      didn t the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs    the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established   a quick opening narration tells of tarzan   casper van dien   being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes   and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage    when the movie starts in 1913   he is a civilized english gentleman   without an english accent     and he is to marry jane   jane march   in less than a week    however   when a wicked archeologist/grave robber named nigel ravens   steve waddington   begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar   one of africa s last great secrets   the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle    at first   jane refuses to go   pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding   but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down   therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape man    once the film gets going   in its own sluggish way     it delves into a series of jungle adventures   as tarzan   jane   and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city    most of the so called adventures are cheesy   predictable   and unexciting   with no pace   tension   or action to speak of    there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies   ranging from   raiders of the lost ark     1981   to   the goonies     1985      when the movie is running short on action   it includes a few greenpeace friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals   releasing a baby elephant from a trap   and throwing ivory tusks into the river    the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality    for instance   when tarzan   who was raised in the jungle   is bit by a cobra   he doesn t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi experienced weekend backpacker would do    instead   he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival    of course   one can t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is    not to ruin the ending or anything   but there is no lost city    there is   however   a lost pyramid   which i suppose is all the resource strapped fx department could come up with   the special effects are not worthy of a made for tv movie      which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid   when it s sitting right out in the middle of an open field    strictly speaking     tarzan and the lost city   isn t even bad enough to have camp quality   although casper van dien s laughably stiff performance comes real close    this movie proves what   starship troopers   only hinted at   he cannot act   but he sure looks well groomed   even in the deepest heart of the african jungle    van dien is much too much of a pretty boy to be an effective tarzan   he s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth    i also wondered what the make up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa 1983 steve perry haircut    waddington makes a decent villain   although he s like a charmless version of belloq from   raiders of the lost ark     as jane   the ex model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan    she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two   but whenever a snake comes into the picture   she is reduced to a hysterical mess    however   amidst all this complaining   i do have one piece of good news       tarzan and the lost city   is so lacking in ideas both new and old   that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid    so   we can say this much for it   at least it had the decency to be short    
Pos, airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film making    after all   it s brought to us by one of the best known satire writing/directing teams    even if most people don t recognize the names behind the films   they are bound to recognize the titles   airplane !   top secret   the naked gun   and hot shots to name a few    but although the zucker/abrahams/zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977   airplane !  remains the true cornerstone of their work   and their directorial debuts    in the seventies   disaster films seemed to be at an all time high    films like earthquake   the towering inferno   and the poseidon adventure were big hits    there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane   a series that spanned the entire decade    and so   in 1980   we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film    this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean            it had to do with bad fish    airplane ! is the story of ted striker   robert hays     an ex fighter pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six   er   seven comrades    unable to stop living in the past   ted s world fell apart    he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job   and eventually   as we begin this film   is getting dumped by his lover   flight attendant elaine dickinson   julie hagerty      in a desperate attempt not to lose her   ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working    unfortunately   she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her   which leaves him wallowing in self pity    in the midst of it all   something happens    someone gets sick    then another    then another    soon   the whole plane is full of deathly ill chicago bound people            and when the pilots get sick   played by peter graves   kareem abdul jabbar   and frank ashmore     who will save the day       gee   i wonder    of course the main draw here is the non stop   whiz bang   comedy   with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags    although i had seen this movie a few times before   i was still laughing thru the entire thing    the most fun character by far is the doctor   played by leslie nielsen    he s a dry   subtle   sterotypically straight faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film    in a film like this   you re not really expecting an elaborate production   so one can t complain about the amateurish quality    what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny   played by stephen stucker    this character is pointless   nauseating   and very unfunny    i don t know why he was put in there   and i don t think anybody will find a good excuse    and when the film nears an end   it slows down quite a bit   almost getting old    you gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long    aside from that   airplane !  is really a top notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic    it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends   especially if they haven t seen it    and if they ask what the plot is   just tell  em   it s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film   but that s not important right now      if you ve seen the film   you ll understand        
Neg, alexander dumas  the three musketeers is one of the most often adapted literary works   and for good reason   the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story    perhaps the musketeer   a new film that   reimagines   the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix   is one adaptation too many    it s just awful   spiritless   silly and unforgivably boring   transforming the timeless classic into a mish mash of old as time clich   s and incoherent   repetitive action sequences    this time   d artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers   who can t even pronounce his character s name    as a boy   he watched his father get killed by febre   tim roth     a lackey of power hungry cardinal richelieu    he vowed to have vengeance    after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman   he goes looking for his enemy    on his quest   he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government    the royal musketeers have lost their gusto   what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal s own guards    only a few loyal swashbuckers remain   among them athos and portos   who are only figureheads in this movie      together with d artagnan   they fight to extricate the queen   catherine deneuve   from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant    oh   and as an afterthought   d artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn   mena suvari      just thought i d mention that    now   look   i don t know whose idea this was   but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue lashing    i have nothing against   modernizing   classic works of literature   at the very least   they can inspire viewers to actually read the book   but films as dull as this have no positive side effects    director peter hyams   known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days   has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas  masterwork   the sense of excitement   cause   and camaraderie    instead   we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous   uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing    when the musketeers finally get to holler   all for one   and one for all     i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt    maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams s tone   which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader s digest condensed version of the story that he gives us    it s as though anything that may have been construed as   fun   was purposely expunged from the production    the joylessness of the proceedings   from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes   can be felt in every frame    chambers can t act   suvari   roth and deneuve can   but aren t given the chance    and when push comes to shove   the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious   though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit    some movies seem sloppy and careless   clearly made for a quick buck    with the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful    the film is intricate   stylish and precise   hitting the wrong note every single time    
Neg, i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews   and in both instances   he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon    now   i personally remember those films as a   starring a major motion picture star b   being funny c   having great action sequences d   great chemistry e   decent character development    hmmm         okay       now on to my review of chill factor    plot   a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex army general   to propose a nuclear device to international prospects    when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps   they must keep it cool on ice   and rush it over to an army base   before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit   and kills millions of people    critique     speed on an ice cream truck   is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one tone movie to its backers   but unfortunately   the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tension filled   original two hours of cinema   is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film   and the lethal weapon movies   stood for    this film is seasoned in cliches   with plenty of badly written dialogue   over the top acting from cuba gooding jr     zero chemistry between the two leads   and horribly tacky bad guys   tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe    my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent   because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously   written     that we just had to crack up    that   and the formula for the film s script which followed the proverbial 1 2    and you guessed it       3 scenario !  and what about all those catchy   hip names to get us to relate to the characters           elvis    and   nighshift     oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters   and yes   it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel      it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr   got involved in this one week old blue cheese smelling project    did they actually think that it would boost their careers   or did they know that the script sucked   but discounted any fall from grace   knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall    most probably the latter    have you seen either fled or bulletproof    well   despite the slight differences in plot   the essentials are basically the same here    you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people   having no choice but to work together to get somewhere   hating each other at first   but over time   learning to respect one another as individuals    yawn    add to that   the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black   drive black cars and black vans   and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head    not too conspicuous   eh    call me a party pooper   but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy   this film just doesn t even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining    one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside   and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island   do not a fun   buddy action flick make    show cuba the money   everybody !        little known facts about this film and its stars   this is not a little known fact or anything   but damn   is it just me or does skeet ulrich look an awful lot like great looking actor johnny depp    skeet s real life nicknames include chester   skeeter and mosquito    he stands 6 1     was born in north carolina   and got married in 1997 to that sex kitten actress from clay pigeons   7   5/10      georgina cates    they own a farm together in virginia and seven dogs    skeet has a long scar on his chest from open heart surgery done when he was 10 to correct a ventricle defect    actor cuba gooding jr   was born in the bronx   new york    in 1984   he break danced during the closing ceremonies of the olympic games in los angeles    he stands 5 10      actress hudson leick   who plays one of the   bad guys/girls   in his movie   is better known from her role as   callisto   on the popular tv series   xena   princess warrior      this film reportedly had a budget of $40 million      i m not exactly sure where all this money went   but it certainly did not register onscreen    interestingly enough   director hugh johnson   who makes his big screen debut with this film   was the cinematographer on the 1996 film white squall and the 1997 demi moore vehicle   g   i    jane   6   5/10

Pos, in tim burton s `sleepy hollow    there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name    he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe    burton s update on washington irving s classic tale of `the legend of sleepy hollow  offers us the mystery of the horseman   when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror    writer andrew kevin walker   `seven    throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes   but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing   as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine    as `sleepy hollow  opens   we re greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau   who won an oscar in burton s `ed wood     landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow   who   on a fateful carriage ride through the forest   is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider    after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town   constable ichabod crane   johnny depp   is sent in to investigate    landlord baltus von tassel   michael gambon   explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case   and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper   played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken   who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods    crane is not a man of great superstition   and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets   things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie      first and foremost   `sleepy hollow  is a fun horror film    as with virtually all burton movies   we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman   who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly    the horseman f/x are stylish and impressive   particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors    but why did i enjoy `sleepy hollow  as much as i did    although enjoyable   it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right      it was the light comic touch that burton applied    the film has the sweetness of a candy apple   usually channeled through depp s wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane   who is no longer a mild mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities    this is certainly not the only alteration that s been made    as the film progresses   it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves    the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together   because for the audience   it s not an issue we particularly wish to be solved    it s more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive    still   we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton s keen eye to capture our attention    the costuming is exceptional   and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout   it s recognizable that the script was refined by award winning playwright tom stoppard      the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many    a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel s daughter katrina   and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent    walken   michael gough   who appeared in burton s `batman  films   and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles    i suppose the strengths behind `sleepy hollow  lie within the central trio   director burton   constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy    all of this is not to be taken seriously   of course    `sleepy hollow  is a lavish   frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children    if you ve got a decent head on your shoulders   you ll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time

Pos, it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a   i    artificial intelligence   just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material    for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home   an outcast seeking family   themes very familiar from most of spielberg s body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e   t    to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan   naming just a few examples    a   i   is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies    it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances    the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions   and with the number of births limited by the government   many couples are yearning for children    and professor hobby   william hurt   has the solution    a robotic boy named david   haley joel osment     who is programmed to love    as a test   david is placed with henry swinton   sam robards   and his wife   monica   frances o connor      their natural born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness    the first third of a   i    deals with david s life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son   martin    circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons    he is abandoned and alone    david   highly influenced by the fairy tale   pinocchio   feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica s love for him    the film s second act follows david s search for the blue fairy   whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish    during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe   jude law     a robot who specializes in sex    spielberg is at his top form in this sequence   offering a brutal   flesh fair   where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers    here   is where kubrick s influence is strongly felt   as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots    the savagery conjures up images from the late director s a clockwork orange    at about two hours and 30 minutes   the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes   a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters    it is all very anti climatic and jarring    these scenes seem almost superfluous   as if from a different film    a   i   is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg 13 rating    it is a story combining hope and intolerance   sacrifice and bigotry   and while it does not coalesce perfectly   the movie does offer some disturbing images    but a   i    is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment    if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination   it is this lad   who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david   a being created for the express purpose of loving    he shines when with monica   beaming with love   as eager as a puppy to please    after being left in the woods   he is confused   lost   hurt   focusing on one objective   to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother s eyes    law is pleasant as the care free robot who really doesn t understand david s quest   but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey    probably the toughest role is o connor s monica    playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin   she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance   but as a threat to her family    she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action    many of a   i    s futuristic sets are breathtaking   especially a mostly submerged new york   lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps    a   i   is a flawed film   and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering   even subconsciously   how it would have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera    would it have been darker    more cynical    we will never know    we can only judge what is before us on the screen   a collaboration of two cinematic giants    a   i    is a most interesting and thought provoking examination of a future that is quickly gaining on us    
Pos, it s terribly unfortunate that   stir of echoes     tautly written and directed by david koepp   who made one of 1996 s unsung treasures     the trigger effect       should be released little more than a month after   the sixth sense     which is still going strong at the box office    these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared   judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night     and although they have eerily similar storylines     stir of echoes   is more of a straightforward psychological horror film   while   the sixth sense   is closer to a psychological drama    additionally   while   the sixth sense   had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business     stir of echoes   is more conventional and predictable in its final twist    and where   the sixth sense   was disturbing     stir of echoes   is just plain scary    i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities   and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits    adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago     stir of echoes   opens with a cute six year old boy named jake   zachary david cope   who is taking a bath    he is speaking directly at the screen   but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there    finally   he asks     does it hurt to be dead      apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people   but unlike   the sixth sense     this young child isn t the focus of the picture    instead   tom witzy   kevin bacon     a chicago lineman   is our protagonist    jake is his son   and maggie   kathryn erbe     whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant   is his hard working wife    one night while at a party with their closest friends   tom convinces maggie s new age sister   lisa   illena douglas     to try and hypnotize him    it unexpectedly works   and before long   tom is seeing things he wouldn t normally see   including a deceased teenage girl   jenny morrison   in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months    seeking help from lisa   she tells him that   while he was under hypnosis   she told him that after he awoke   his mind will remain clear and free   like an opened door    she didn t expect it to work   but it did   and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees       stir of echoes   isn t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination   but in the thick   atmospheric mood it conjures up   it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror drama   and is not only effective on a technical level   but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working class family    kevin bacon and   especially   kathryn erbe   1997 s   dream with the fishes       are top notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems    after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions   he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house   and instead of maggie not being understanding   she instead believes what tom says   and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through   does not try to stop his pursuit    bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts   and therefore   are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet    in a masterfully done   entrancing sequence   tom is hypnotized by lisa   but instead of watching him   we instead see what he sees   starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness    lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater   and so   we   as audience members   are watching a movie screen from inside a theater   which is also showing a movie screen in a theater    telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen   we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is   sleep      never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly construed as this one    truthfully   this set piece   and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt   are worth the full price of admission alone   just to see them on the big screen    having loads of fun with her small role as maggie s sister   lisa   illeana douglas   1995 s   to die for     her last great character   is a delight   but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films    funny and enjoyably offbeat   douglas gets to utter the best line in the film   while talking to maggie about tom s visions of the girl   she remarks     i wouldn t be worried about him seeing another girl   although the fact that she s dead gives one pause      also of note are jenny morrison   1994 s   intersection       who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character   and liza weil   remarkable in 1998 s   whatever     as morrison s grieving teenage sister   debbie    if the resolution of   stir of echoes   does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential   and it doesn t     what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty    the music score   by james newton howard   and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects   successfully compliment and foreshadow the off kilter frame of mind that tom is put into   and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically written characters       stir of echoes   isn t as good as   the sixth sense     but why should it need to be    both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet   and   stir of echoes   really is a spinetinglingly good horror film    
Neg, it was with a huge lack of something to do that i decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon   when the only good things on tv are the second rate movies they show   some are good   they showed   total recall   before this one      if you know me   i think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live    and this includes keanu reeves    what do i hate about seagal    i hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and non threatening situation   the squint      i hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around   bullying people up   saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynold s hairpiece in   boogie nights      i despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights    i hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain    i hate his non satirical messages   in the beginning of this one   he slaps on a quote from arthur miller   which has nothing to do with the film   except it s about brooklyn where this film takes place      and i hate how he s so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing   during the end credits   he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him      sure   the guy s probably a nice guy in person   i actually found him very non threatening when he was on letterman not too long ago      but the guy makes worse films than reagan did    so what s the plot of this shit terpiece    well       something  about him trying to catch a stupid ass crook   william forsythe   who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight    i couldn t believe how bad this scene was   the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect   ahem !      and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off    i m sorry   did anyone ever hear of concealing one s self    so in comes ex brooklynite seagal   who dedicates his life to catching this guy    and i just wished he had caught him in the beginning   then ended the film    but noooo   this drags on   as he bullies forsythe s family members   including a stupid bar owner   and none other than gina gershon as his other bar owner sister      and forsythe more than once threatens his family    at one point   he actually comes to their house and stalks them like a non threatening nicholson in   the shining     complete with them all hiding in the bathroom   but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away      seagal paints himself as a lovable person   with a son   and a fiancee    he even shows him hanging with his son   checking up on his homework   and then about to take him out for a bit of   catch     when he s conveniently called away on assignment    i dunno about you   but playing   catch   with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares    he also shows him as that bad ass he wants to be   with scenes of him bullying crooks around   and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after he s unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue    serves them right    this film   as some of his do   has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented   but don t appear to be in this film    i already mentioned gina gershon   who s pretty horrible in this one     as well as william forsythe   who over acts terribly    i know this guy can act   he was awesome in   raising arizona   as goodman s partner in crime    but he s just awful here    jerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down    why is he the only one who gives a good performance    well   because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility    he seems to be in here just to give it a cool   law and order   feeling   even if it s not a   cool   feeling      and in cameos are b rated erotic thriller cinemax style stars   shannon whirry   as   terry malloy     which is more of a bad joke than a clever one   and athena massey    oh !  and   er    s julliana margiulles has two scenes       out for justice   just proves once again that american action films just suck    i know that there s such a good thing as good action   he s called john woo    but if you re in the mood for some good old no brainer   fun yet dumb action   don t bother watching this    it s so stupid that it s boring    
Neg, lauded as a genius by many   stanley kubrick commands a superlative filmography that includes such critically acclaimed films as   2001   a space odyssey       a clockwork orange       lolita     and   dr    strangelove   or   how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb      now   sadly   he s added   eyes wide shut   to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his near flawless copybook    kubrick   alas   should have quit while he was ahead    this much publicized psycho sexual tease a thon   with its star billing of real life marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman   is nothing more than one long   two and a half hours long   boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut    kubrick   faithless to arthur schnitzler s 1926 novella   dream story     has confused eroticism with nudity    he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly    he has confused profundity with pretentiousness    in addition   the director has made some strange casting choices   leaving sydney pollack in and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh out    pollack   the director of such box office hits as   tootsie   and   out of africa     is normally solid in his occasional acting stints but here he s miserably out of his depth        and there isn t much depth to begin with !  unhappily   there s not likely to be a director s cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel and leigh was the right one    in fact   with the exception of the stark black and white credits   snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack   and many   many grainy tracking shots down lavishly decorated corridors   there s none of kubrick s trademark brilliance in this film    it doesn t help that the story   as delivered   is ridiculous    cruise and kidman   who bring little more than marital torpor to the project   play well to do new yorkers bill and alice harford    he s a doctor and she s an unemployed art gallery director and they share a central park west address    at an opulent party hosted by their friend victor ziegler   pollack     alice gets a little tipsy and starts dancing with a jeremy irons like hungarian   who s singularly determined to get her in the sack    bill   too   is seen arm in arm with a couple of models before he s pulled away to deal with an overdoser    back home   bill and alice smoke a little pot before alice s aggressive jealousy kicks in    as retribution   she confesses to her husband that she once had deep feelings for a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she and bill once stayed    this hurtful admission sends bill into a tailspin   he pounds the streets of the village in his heavy black overcoat struggling with black and white images of alice in the grip of a horny midshipman    it s all way too much for him    for revenge   bill almost has sex with a hooker    he almost has feelings for a underage girl he sees in a costume store    then he almost does the hooker s roommate    and he s almost involved in an overblown rococo orgy when an old college chum of his tips him off to a mysterious   password protected party where everyone wears masks and   the women are incredible     i   e     naked      this   erotic   set piece   a cult ish bacchanal complete with chanting   incense   and lots of strategically placed partygoers covering up the dirty   might impress the likes of hugh hefner   but it s a lot less shocking than it s intended to be    what s the big deal    bill doesn t exactly * do * anything   other than throw his money and credentials around     and alice only ever lusted in her heart    whoop dee doo    still   they make up at the same agonizingly slow pace  was kubrick   notorious for multiple takes   paying them at an hourly rate    even geniuses have their bad days       eyes wide shut   just happens to be kubrick s bad day   an unerotic   disappointing   and altogether pointless end to an otherwise memorable career    
Pos, martin scorsese s triumphant adaptation of edith wharton s the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker   the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life    it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900 s   but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder   and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker    this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese s finest    newland archer   day lewis   is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland   ryder     a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker   who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful    the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families   in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others    on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may   countess ellen olenska   pfeiffer     cousin of may   walks into archer s life    archer is immediately captivated   and finds himself in love with ellen    archer is also bound by the limits of new york society   which is an intrusive as any other in the world    archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska   attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status    the film s subject matter may seem alien to scorsese   but the theme is definitely not    it is a theme of forbidden romance   guilty pleasures   and the consequences causes because of those actions    there is a painstakingly flawed hero   and his choice between the life he wants   and the life he is destined for    in truth   it is a film about a society the audience doesn t know about   but wants to find out more   much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun    the performances are absolutely breathtaking    day lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take    pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska   a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well    ryder is probably the gem of the group   for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot   and slowly pushes day lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending    the supporting cast is also wonderful   with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one s memory    scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking    his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight    he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery    his script is also excellent   slow in buildup   with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed    it is difficult to make a period piece gripping   scorsese   however   does it beautifully    the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere    he is patient   but he films everything and anything remotely important    the cameras sweep   pan   track   and do more than they ve ever done   but they are so subtle   one doesn t realize he s watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing    the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot   but the viewer doesn t notice it   because we want to see more of this gorgeous world    there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding   and joanne woodward  narration is exquisite    not a fast film like goodfellas   this shares more in common with kundun than anything else    and like kundun   this is a slow starting film that truly shines   when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end    a beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year    
Pos, mary norton s children s book series   the borrowers   has been made into several below average television movies    so   i wasn t too enthused as i entered the theater for the big screen debut of the minute clan    but i was in for a shock   the borrowers is actually a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs and even some decent special effects    the lender family is being thrown out of their longtime home    their aunt   who owned the property   never left a will    now   an unscrupulous lawyer   ocious potter   john goodman   plans to demolish the house and replace it with an ultra modern housing development    but the lenders are not alone in their house    living under the floorboards is a family of borrowers   4 inch tall people who make their living as scavengers from the human   beans   above    the clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders   especially once they discover the evil potter actually has a copy of the will which leaves the home to the lenders    so it is up to the clocks   pod   jim broadbent   and homily   celia imrie     along with their kids   arrietty   flora newbigin   and peagreen   tom felton     to recover the will and save the household    but when potter learns of the tiny people   he enlists the skills of exterminator jeff   mark williams   to kill off the clan    there s plenty of attention to detail in the borrowers   especially in the furnishings of the clock family house   made out of lost board game parts and credit cards    the background details are nearly as rich as the entertaining story    the various predicaments of the clock family are clever and thrilling    based on an original story   the screenwriters did a good job at imagining all the potential and unusual perils that could exist for a 4 inch tall person    as the villain   john goodman s performance veers on the edge of being over the top    but his performance suits the role well   and he does very well in the film s many slapstick moments    with a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets   bluescreen shots and cgi   the special effects in the borrowers are very well done    there are a few times when you can spot the effects at work   but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief    hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled a children only movie   for it is surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch    
Pos, mickey mouse had better watch his back    there s a new critter in town   and he s the nameless animal attraction of   mouse hunt     dreamworks skg s clever first foray into family fare    although it runs out of steam towards its end   this live action comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disney s entire 1997 non animated   kiddie oriented catalog        but consider that list includes dismal tripe like   air bud       flubber   and   that darn cat     and it s really not such a difficult feat to pull off    still   throw the two rodents in a boxing arena   and i ll be hoping that the mouse from   mouse hunt   knocks some sense back into mickey    nathan lane   robin williams  significant other from   the birdcage     and lee evans   last seen as a nervous bellhop in   the fifth element     play ernie and lars smuntz   befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father   william hickey   in his last role      a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old mansion    although lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former   he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect    but there s a lone obstacle in their way    a single mouse lives within the walls of the house   and he s not about to give up his place of residence without a fight    movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite    the effects blending the talents of 60 some live mice   one animatronic mouse and one computer generated mouse are pretty seamless    the splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burton s mind   the smuntz s architecturally unsound mansion is like something straight out of   the nightmare before christmas     and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent price s warped contraptions from   edward scissorhands         mouse hunt   is a pretty dark movie    even some of the humor can be grim    but it s hardly ever mean spirited    the star of the show is neither the top billed lane nor the titular mouse    it s lanky british comedian evans   whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill   note a toned down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease     evans  banter with the ever affable lane is funny stuff   too   and holds its own against the movie s more flashy physical shtick    vicki lewis   beth from   newsradio     is solid in a supporting role as lars  money grubbing wife    and in a nifty bit of novelty casting   christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously   popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a   calcium deficiency      blech    a basically one joke idea    a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans    is given a rather engaging execution    their sparring is imaginatively realized   i don t think i ll ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda     and although you really never fully root for either side   that s okay    a warm and fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share       mouse hunt   may take a while to get going   the rather lengthy set up could test the patience of some of the younger children   although i rather liked it   much in part to lane and evans     and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long   but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable   not unlike the original   home alone      
Neg, nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre      frankenweenie       beetlejuice       batman       edward scissorhands       ed wood       mars attacks !       yet none of them have been horror films       sleepy hollow   is his first attempt to actually scare people    i greeted the prospect with high anticipation   burton s whole career seemed to be leading up to this    i left disappointed    andrew kevin walker s screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story   the legend of sleepy hollow      in the movie ichabod crane   johnny depp   is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors    ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders    several of the town s leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman    although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him   ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning    he also discovers that the killings are not random   that the victims are tied together by a secret    along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching   literally   young woman   christina ricci   and the son of one of the murder victims   marc pickering      my reaction   ho hum    the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting    that in itself is forgivable   hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages    however   burton s attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy    it might be his background    in his previous movies   goofy was the goal    along the same lines   it doesn t help that creature designer   and producer   kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue in cheek tales from the crypt tv series    a witch s eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit s   a tree spurts blood like it s in a monty python sketch   and the headless horseman            well   he s a guy without a head            on a horse   boo !      the performances are also awful    although he s impressed me with his work in other films   depp doesn t seem to know what to do with ichabod   and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that s supposed to pass for an 18th century accent    ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic   which guarantees that we won t sympathize with her character    the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish    the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee   martin landau   and christopher walken    i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola s projected series of gothic adaptations   a series that produced only   bram stoker s dracula   and   mary shelley s frankenstein      coppola is an executive producer for   sleepy hollow     and the script reflects his interest in early forms of   moving pictures     particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion       there s a bird on one side of the card   a cage on the other    when the card is flipped rapidly   the bird appears to be caged      bottom line   the hollow isn t the only thing that s sleepy    
Pos, no   it is not a bad film   in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose   i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly    event horizon is not your run of the mill sci fi film   i m sure many who have watched this will agree with me    it is not even original in that sense   and it does borrow heavily from films like alien   hellraiser and even blade runner    the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build up that makes it wonderfully horrifying    the story brings us to the year 2050   where space travel have since enormously progressed    the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose   it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man s lifetime    the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years   it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune    a search and rescue team led by miller   fishburne   is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon    the designer of the ship   dr   weir   neill   follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship    event horizon is a sci fi horror film   much truer to the word than say   alien would ever be    while in alien   the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces   in event horizon   the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying    the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb   up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough !  i can t stand this anymore !      there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime    the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also   the acting is only at most   average by most commercial standards    even so   the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film   thanks to its well paced storytelling   disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences   which incidentally   has been quite generously removed by our censorship board      director paul anderson   who did mortal kombat   and his team of `atmosphere  creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror     this picture did not do very well in the us box office most probably for the dread factor impact it has on most audiences   people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this    although on the face of it   event horizon is mostly molded for mass entertainment   many thrills   spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus    however   the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing    my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience  of event horizon    i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us    be forewarned   this film is not for the faint hearted nor for pure entertainment    be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film !  event horizon is highly recommended     but at your own risk !  it has been a long time since good horror embraced the big screen   and event horizon is one    
Pos, one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction    the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy   innocent fun    sometimes the stories are compelling    sometimes they re not    but   with the exception of the first film in the series   which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces     i ve never been bored by any of the enterprise s numerous missions    star trek   insurrection is no exception    the film has gotten some negative reviews   a friend of mine actually thinks it s the worst in the series     but i m not really sure why    it s an exciting   often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film    some say it s a bit too light   and more of a long episode than a film    others say the special effects are cheesy and that it s boring    i simply enjoyed the film    insurrection   which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast   introduces us to a race of people called the ba ku   the ba ku are very old   most of them are about three hundred years old     but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet    of course   these peaceful people can t horde this fountain of youth all for themselves   leave it up to their archenemies   the son a   led by ru afo   f    murray abraham     to mess everything up    the son a   who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable   strike a deal with the federation to move the ba ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying    that s when captain picard   patrick stewart   steps in   he realizes that moving the ba ku would kill them   it also helps that he falls in love with a ba ku woman   donna murphy        so   with his trusty crew   picard defies the federation to keep the ba ku in their natural habitat    when dealing with a series with as much history as this   it s not entirely necessary to re introduce your characters with each episode    this is why i believe non fans have a hard time getting into star trek   in order to enjoy it   one has to understand how to approach it    insurrection   however   does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters    stewart is bold as always   a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together    jonathan frakes   who also directed   is funny as commander riker   a subplot with data   brent spiner   discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting   and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain   overacting like crazy    frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact   insurrection is an exciting film   with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action    this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation   and the result is very pleasing to the eye   particularly in the climactic scenes   in which the son a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba ku planet   the special effects have a clean   impressively sharp look    if i have any complaint about the film   it s that it tries to take a moral stance when it s not very appropriate to do so    i don t think it s that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba ku in order to save the lives of thousands    better yet   why couldn t they have co existed    insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience    with it s inherent camp factor   the star trek series doesn t seem well equipped to deal with issues like this    i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle    
Pos, one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy s wedding    and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it    her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald   who hasn t made a worthwhile film since 1986    but the fact is   betsy s wedding is also an alan alda film    and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years   alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects   including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life    written and directed by alda   betsy s wedding is a vibrant slice of life   mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor    alda s comic elixir is smooth and refreshing  and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare    as bride and groom   molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film   but they are by far the least interesting    walsh is a nonentity   with all the screen presence of a door knob    ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain    she looks hideous with her short cropped orange hair   red lip stick and grotesque outfits    she s supposed to be a dress designer   but she looks more like a clown    and to make matters worse   ringwald s performance matches her appearance    thankfully   alda keeps ringwald s screen time to a minimum   he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters    the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride s working class   italian family and the groom s rich   gentile family    ringwald s folks are homey and down to earth   with alda as her free spirited father   madeline kahn as her practical mother   and ally sheedy as her lonely sister    walsh s clan   on the other hand   is prim   proper and ostentatious    when the two families meet and mingle   the movie becomes a story of culture clash   or as one character puts it     money versus values      ally sheedy   in a wonderfully understated performance   is one of the film s most pleasant surprises    sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body    it s anthony lapaglia   however   who seizes the spotlight    lapaglia plays stevie dee   a suave   overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old fashioned chivalry    lapaglia s sincere but dim witted character is a riot    and what s uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro   with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure    lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting   and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role model and partly a rip off    i don t know whether to say a star is born or a star is re born   but i do know that lapaglia s over the top performance should not be missed    the scrumptious comic acting   however   extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia    joe pesci   in particular   sinks his teeth into his role as alda s unscrupulous brother in law   a slum lord with mob ties   who is cheating on his wife   catherine o hara      alda   faced with challenge of both directing and acting   somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride s financially strapped father   a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet    the film adopts alda s psychological point of view as he tries to one   plan the wedding   and two   pay for it    as a filmmaker   alda s style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful    and while he doesn t have the comic genius of a woody allen   alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy    
Neg, plot   two teen couples go to a church party   drink and then drive    they get into an accident    one of the guys dies   but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life   and has nightmares    what s the deal    watch the movie and   sorta   find out        critique   a mind fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea   but presents it in a very bad package    which is what makes this review an even harder one to write   since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold   mess with your head and such   lost highway & memento     but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films   and these folks just didn t snag this one correctly    they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept   but executed it terribly    so what are the problems with the movie    well   its main problem is that it s simply too jumbled    it starts off   normal   but then downshifts into this   fantasy   world in which you   as an audience member   have no idea what s going on    there are dreams   there are characters coming back from the dead   there are others who look like the dead   there are strange apparitions   there are disappearances   there are a looooot of chase scenes   there are tons of weird things that happen   and most of it is simply not explained    now i personally don t mind trying to unravel a film every now and then   but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again   i get kind of fed up after a while   which is this film s biggest problem    it s obviously got this big secret to hide   but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes    and do they make things entertaining   thrilling or even engaging   in the meantime    not really    the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this   so we actually figured most of it out by the half way point   so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense   but it still didn t the make the film all that more entertaining    i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is   into it   even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding    i mean   showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! !  okay   we get it       there  are people chasing her and we don t know who they are    do we really need to see it over and over again    how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie    apparently   the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves   and it shows    there might ve been a pretty decent teen mind fuck movie in here somewhere   but i guess   the suits   decided that turning it into a music video with little edge   would make more sense    the actors are pretty good for the most part   although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty   only in a new neighborhood    but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller   who holds her own throughout the entire film   and actually has you feeling her character s unraveling    overall   the film doesn t stick because it doesn t entertain   it s confusing   it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime   despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it    oh   and by the way   this is not a horror or teen slasher flick       it s  just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids    it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since    whatever       skip  it !  where s joblo coming from    a nightmare of elm street 3   7/10     blair witch 2   7/10     the crow   9/10     the crow   salvation   4/10     lost highway   10/10     memento   10/10     the others   9/10     stir of echoes   8/10    
Pos, robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible   god given gifts   but are able to act like ordinary people    in   the natural     1984     he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs   the baseball player who was destined to be   the best there ever was     but still acted like a humble farm boy    in   butch cassidy and the sundance kid     1969     he was the most dangerous shot in the west   yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good looking charmer    even in   indecent proposal     1993     where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love   redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency   especially when reciting a tale of lost love    in his latest film     the horse whisperer     based on the best selling novel by nicholas evans   redford again plays such a character    redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie   i suppose the character of tom booker   a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses   was just too good to pass up    despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses   a magazine article coins the phrase   horse whisperer   to describe his uncanny talent     booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life    booker s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean   kristin scott thomas     a new york magazine editor whose daughter   grace   scarlett johansson     was recently in a horrible accident    the accident   which is filmed with gut wrenching horror   happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses   an eighteen wheeler kills grace s friend   severely wounds and traumatizes grace s horse   pilgrim   and causes grace to lose part of her right leg    annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed   grace will be healed as well   which leads her to booker    at first   she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse   but that doesn t work    instead   she packs up grace and pilgrim   leaves her husband   robert   sam neill   behind   and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother   frank   chris cooper     and his sister in law   diane   dianne wiest      in many ways   the film is like a journey   both literally and symbolically    the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal   and it s hard not to see annie and grace s leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs   country    in   the horse whisperer     country is clearly the victor    the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness   and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide open spaces of montana that grace s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate   annie s controlling nature begins to relax   and pilgrim once again learns to trust people    redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed   a river runs through it   six years ago    in many ways     the horse whisperer   comes from the same poetic vein as   river     and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera time on the grass and mountains    but then   that would ruin the magic    much of the film s photography is truly elegant   and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land    to further emphasize this   redford and cinematographer robert richardson     natural born killers       platoon     cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film   which takes place in new york   with mostly cold   harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1   85   1 aspect ratio   when the action shifts to montana   richardson switches to soft focus and natural lighting   and the screen widens to a 2   35   1 aspect ratio    in terms of the story itself     the horse whisperer   gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean s   a brief encounter     1945   and clint eastwood s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller s   the bridges of madison county     richard lagravenese   co screenwriter here also adapted   bridges        although   the horse whisperer   has a strong romantic sensibility   i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story    it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who s being left behind for this brief   heart sweeping affair   but there rarely is    in   the horse whisperer     the thankless role of being the fuddy duddy husband falls to sam neill    he plays the character as a decent   hard working man who is a good husband and father   his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him    he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away   but simply because he happens to be a normal   fairly uninspiring man    there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character    it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen   booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all   while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out of place in a baseball cap    as they enter the pen   booker assuredly swings over the fence   while robert hesitates   then opens the gate and   in a goofy moment   forgets to close it behind him    it s a small scene   but it clearly demonstrates the movie s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness    after all   booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it    the best scenes in   the horse whisperer   tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie   but rather the healing process of grace and her horse    although booker s horse training methods are mythical and unrealistic   the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing    these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace   some of which are humorous   and all of which are tender and true    at some point   i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more    nevertheless   redford is obviously a romantic at heart   and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film    there are no dramatic sex scenes   but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow dancing   always moving ever closer together   that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together    although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character   there are enough moments like that which make   the horse whisperer   worth the price of admission    
Neg, seen may 2   1998 at 3   40 p   m   at the crossgates cinema 18   theater #13   with chris wessell and sean o shea for $5    [theater rating   * * * 1/2   very good sound   picture   and seats]  the big budget   mega hype   event   movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one    gluttony is hollywood s favorite sin   but it is the movie goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever worsening basis       lost in space   is the latest such offering   a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre    it s made up of every element of science fiction   but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for    audiences  attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films   this one opens with a fast paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film   probably because it has   star wars   written all over it     but as the producers  way of showing off their budget through the special effects    battle scenes are worthless without tension   and since we have no idea what the setting is it s impossible to care about anything that happens    in essence   the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game   not a piece of filmmaking    we meet the robinson family   a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth s behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources    each member of the family has a special trait and personality   and yet none of them seem like actual people    professor john robinson   hurt   is the intelligent   quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it   it s obvious what role this aspect will play      of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other   while the necessary problems are   resolved   at the right moments    the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it s presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire   and is so pathetic it s laughable    the first act is not a building of a story   but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements   such as plot   conflict   and characterization   god forbid !      we re provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent    in fact   it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non existent    yes   the characters do speak   but they do not talk    they say things that only relate to the conflict   but they never really interact   unless it s the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west   leblanc   and uptight   unemotional judy robinson   graham        it s amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens    eventually the pacing rapidly increases   but the amount of genuine interest does not    the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr   smith   oldman     the cartoony villain   and his plans for sabotage    what ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts    the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as   alien    lite    the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive    but there s never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly    plotlines are developed   but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario    the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes   but it s presented in such a ridiculous way it s utterly boring    by the time the last act rolls around   there is no sense of a payoff building    the ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax   instead   it seems to come to a sudden halt   but at least it ends at all         lost in space   is major film production at its worst    it s frightening that a film so poorly written   directed   and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment    
Neg, starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king   the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics   but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public  particularly kids   wanted to see    therefore   it s with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas    despite some innovation and risk taking   the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes   as are its characters    a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the   savages   that live there    the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust    only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash    the ending   as it turns out   is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film s finer moments    the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth    governor ratcliffe   for instance   is a snobbish   single minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses    captain john smith is a blond hunk who   while   slightly   misguided   is good at heart    pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time    she even comes complete with insignificant best friend    again   against tradition   talking animals aren t used   but a lusty   wizened   talking tree is    this is an odd compromise   but it s one of the few elements that really work    the animals are a delight   and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation    maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes    the talking tree   who seems to have a thing for john smith   is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch    the music   a welcome delight in the later disney films   is mostly a let down here   with the exception of the catchy and motivational     colors of the wind      mel gibson   as the voice of john smith   has a solid singing voice and should have been used more    the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs   the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character    i was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time    even the children in the audience seemed restless    while there s no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want  or disney wants them to  most i believe will be disappointed    perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history    it s all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie s entertainment value   but doing so to historical facts doesn t work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer s minds and plot holes that are never filled    even the artwork   another disney strong point   varies greatly in quality   making any story problems even more obvious    as mentioned above   there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film    for instance   if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with   savages     why did he so quickly change his previous   kill as many indians as i can   attitude    if he was such a nice guy after all   he should have changed his ways long before this    or how about pocahontas  amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men    i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience   but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot   history was modified in the film anyway    as it is   i wonder if it doesn t give kids the wrong impression    in short   the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set    while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions   they end up failing on too many levels    
Neg, the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes    alas   it refers to our heroes !  as it turns out   the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth   via the mir space station   thinks of the human race as a virus    perhaps even a cancer    that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further    after all   we have taken up this entire planet   and if they let us live for another billion years or so   we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one    but the human race doesn t have much to worry about    after all   there s a woman named foster   jamie lee curtis   out there stopping the computer virus    she s the chief navigator on a sea vessel   travelling with her is captain everton   donald sutherland     steve baker   william baldwin     woods   marshall bell     squeaky   julio oscar mechoso     and richie   sherman augustus      they re all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous   abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters    lucky for us   we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board    the evil captain everton thinks he s going to take the ship in and get a reward   he convinces his crew that there s going to be big money   so they try to salvage the ship    soon   however   when it s apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power   they realize that something bad must have happened    finally   they meet nadia   joanna pacula   who explains their situation   a computer virus has taken over the ship !  it s creating bio mechanical life forms to eliminate the human race !  virus is a truly dumb action thriller   one of negligible intelligence and innovation    when considering the entire film   you will realize that it lacks a single original scene    it s a direct rip off of nearly every james cameron film   aliens   the abyss   and the terminator films are the most plagiarized     more importantly   it s basically the same movie as last year s deep rising    i liked deep rising simply because it s funny    it knows it s silly and derivative    virus takes itself seriously    and   in the most serious manner possible   it steals from every good and bad film of the genre   showing you countless familiar scenes   and sporting a cookie cutter plot that any film of the sci fi/horror genre could fit with a little trimming    but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out    okay   let me get this straight    the alien race   which is never really explained   is basically sentient electricity    they need to make themselves physical   so they use a space station to get onto a ship   which is surrounded by water   but who cares about that      on the ship   they make a bunch of clunky   immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people    after that   they start using the dead people to create half human   half machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around    the leader   of course   is a big creature    every film like this has a big creature at the end   but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around    virus is indeed a cliched film   but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn t very threatening    it s established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it   but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there    on one level   virus is almost passable fun    it s really gory   and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal   the director   john bruno   worked on a lot of cameron s films      there s also a nice array of actors   even though none of them do any acting   except for donald sutherland   who does a lot of very bad acting      the bottom line   however   is this   virus is a bad movie    it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing    in that order   i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films   simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes    
Neg, the previews for the movie are pretty good    they show a little plot   all the characters   and the emotional highlights   all spliced together to give a general impression of the script    unfortunately   the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes    the residents of mystery love hockey    mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football    the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who s guilty of shooting another man   yes   that s one of the movie s jokes      every saturday   the best players pair off for a game   and the whole town comes to watch    the town s prodigal son charlie   hank azaria   wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated    mystery s national fame has the town abuzz    a week later   charlie actually shows up in person   and he brings with him an offer from the nhl    the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals    the mysterians see this as both good and bad    on the one hand   they d love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition    on the other hand   they don t want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes    the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition    biebe   russell crowe   has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys   including his new replacement    he s already resentful   and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife    crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film   so he s just kind of stuck with constantly brooding    charlie   meanwhile   is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man s worth    his   gift   of the feature story   and of the new york rangers   was his way of compensating for not being a better skater    he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit   but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him    burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter   the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans    walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey   but he actively tries to put it behind him    he wants his son to take the game more seriously   but he wants his community to just get over it    reynolds could have been good   but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner   and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together    one character actually was interesting    biebe s wife   mary mccormack     like the judge   understood that there was more to life than hockey    but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community    she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open    her unique insight is verbalized once   and it lasts only a scene before it is gone   but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom    mysterty   alaska follows a handful of other characters   but none are well developed or worth mentioning    the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story   no underlying thing that the movie is really about    instead   roach and screenwriters david e   kelley and sean o byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy    they try to make you laugh and cry   to feel outrage and pride    they present the framing and cadence for jokes   but there s nothing truly funny    they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness   but they give you nothing to be really sad about    as columnist molly ivins would say   it s all hat   no cattle    the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about    there is a funeral scene   played with appropriate gravity and somber music    it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what s truly important    russell crowe steps forward to speak   about to spell out the movie s metaphor for us    he says that what really matters in life is   community            then adds   and hockey      i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear    only mildly bad   mystery   alaska probably deserves 2 stars    i even laughed out loud   genuine laughs in places    but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers   a friend of roach   turned up in a role that didn t suit him    myers is a comic character actor    he puts on masks   becomes an outrageous caricature   and is funny    he s great as austin powers   dr   evil   or any of his scottish characters    nobody else in mysterty   alaska is a comic caricature    all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi serious roles    for roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast   toward his audience   and indeed toward the film itself    it s an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously    
Pos, there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review   not because of their own complexity   but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original    one of such masterpieces is casablanca   probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art   but definitely the most popular one    its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere   but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day    casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience    one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail   at least judging by conventional movie making wisdom of its time    it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn t been produced on stage   screenplay by three writers   julius g   epstein   philip j   epstein and howard koch   was beeing written as shooting went along   the main actors were producers  second choice   and   finally   man behind camera   michael curtiz was considered to be capable   but not great director    however   the movie was commercially successful and earned three   oscars     including the one for the best film    until this very day   it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film  making in its own golden age    the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda   yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story    in december 1941   casablanca   exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral   yet nazi collaborating french vichy government    thousands of refugees from war torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america   and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas    many shady characters thrive on their misery   including the corrupt police chief   captain renault   rains      his best friend is rick blaine   bogart     who used to be idealistic anti fascist   and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of   sticking his neck for nobody      however   everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas    this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca    one of them is victor laszlo   henreid     czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe    he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund   bergman     with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris    the couple needs visas   especially because of the gestapo major strasser   veidt   being on their trail    rick is now forced to choose between love   wounded pride   self preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism    the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration   humphrey bogart   most legendary actor in the history of cinema   is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status    bogart s portrayal of rick as complicated man   torn between idealistic past and bitter present   was so perfect   that his icon would forever be connected with that character    another icon in his company is ingrid bergman   great actress of old hollywood   here in her artistic and visual prime    the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking   some happier times when the romance on the screen didn t look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works    for many people   casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made    but the reason for that isn t the romance itself   it s the realistic story of people forced to make tough   and often wrong choices in their life    the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads    the supporting actors also did a marvellous job    sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic   john huston s maltese falcon   yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters    another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle   character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny    unfortunately   the charisma that burdened laszlo   leaves little place for difficult choice   making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling    however   rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca    captain renault   brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime   was embodiment of perfect   almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm    despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie   rains managed to make renault sympathetic character   and his final conversion to the side of good   symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary    rains also gave another dimension to the movie   making it even more ambiguous   people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault s relationship towards rick   and rick s final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations    together with well drawn characters and exciting story   the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere    professional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies   but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable   if not realistic    any way   even if we don t see it as a historical document   casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration    
Pos, this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated    there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood s most famous celebrities   some fabulous animation and a compelling story    this is the best we ve seen from disney since   beauty and the beast     1996      this film begins an unspecified time following the happily ever after conclusion to toy story    in the aftermath of their earlier adventures   buzz   voice of tim allen   and woody   voice of tom hanks   are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony   content with their   lives      one day   andy broke woody s arm off   while playing with him    woody is now officially discarged and worthless   left with his nightmares   where he lies in a trash can with the other discards    later andy s mother decides to have a yard sale   and she collects a few old toys from her son s room    since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang   woody goes to the rescue   leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back    although his mission is successful   he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al   voice of wayne knight   spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale    the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series     woody s roundup      if he can acquire woody   al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit    so   after andy s mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy   al steals him   and it s up to the other toys   led by buzz   to go into the city to save their friend    and so   buzz   rex   voice of wallace shawn     hamm   voice of john ratzenberger     mr   potatohead   voice of don rickles     and slinky   voice of jim varney     go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend   they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys    there are car chases   gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis   who   by the way   resembles darth vader      meanwhile   woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family   a cowgirl named jessie   voice of joan cusack     a horse named bullseye   and a father figure called the prospector   voice of kelsey grammar      they offer him another life   as a celebrity    a toy in a museum in japan    he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while   before he grows up   and be forgotten   or be admired by children for generations    the problem is   if woody escapes from al s clutches and returns home   they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage    a real effort is made in the technical department    the animation is rich and colorful   with lots of wonderful details   the   cinematography   is also extremely improved since toy story   there are a lot of complicated swings   turns and close ups that really make an impression    lighting and filters are used to create a mood   as in a surprisingly emotional moment   jessie s remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy   the film contains a lot of in side jokes   such as the one about videogames     and entertaining parodies on   jurassic park   and   star wars      the film ends with the   failed takes     the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv    these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film    but what in the end makes   toy story 2   a memorable experience is not the jokes   its multiple parodies or marvelous animation    it is its heart and emotions    the story about the meaning of friendship   love and even life itself    it is not difficult to predict that   toy story 2   would be a huge economical success   but its artistic achievement was unexpected    unexpected because the first film wasn t much more than a demonstration of special effects    but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn t produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs    but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film   making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years    this is a big step away from the ancient laws of disney animation    off course   this is not   antz     it is not as intelligent   this is not a landmark and no masterpiece   but i promise that you ll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have    whether this is the best animated film of the year   i dare not say    my choice would probably be   the iron giant     but   along side with   american pie     this is the comedy of the year    i almost lost my hopes for disney   but   toy story 2   proves that disney hasn t lost their ability to entertain

   so chris   spend your eternity with annie   as she is on earth   reliving your favorite memories   or hang out with her when she was growing up    you+ve got eternity   perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out    and forcing her to write   i still exist   in her diary   imo   is just too tacky    there are many other ideas   all of which are a hundred times better than what+s unraveled in the plot    the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before   and just come out stale    most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects   so when they finally show themselves   he realizes they were with him all along    and when this happens   the film runs in slow motion   as if to build emotion     gag me with a spoon     so the only things for me to like are sciorra+s effective performance   who rises far above this mundane material   and the special effects    please note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals   i did not enjoy  all  of them   some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe   everybody floating up and down in invisible strings    it sounds like a joke   but it+s really true   i really tried to block out the dialogue   and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack    my vote goes to a rare cd called   never say die     1981   from petra   a christian rock group    it+s pretty good   and they have a song about annie   who commits suicide       it+s too late for annie/she+s gone away for good/there+s so much we d have told her/and now we wish we could/but it+s too late            melancholic   yes    depressing   yes    but far more entertaining        so   in case you don+t know   let me be straight    suicide  bad     don+t do it     no   no   no     got it     you  shouldn+t have to pay $7   50 to hear this in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest      
Pos,    note   there are spoilers regarding the film s climax   the election   of course    we see matthew broderick   a man torn to a primal state   he s been unfaithful to his wife   lied to and manipulated his students   and by the same token they ve demeaned his masculinity   his self respect   his desperate attempt at changing the world    and yet   he equates the cause of his pain   his torment   with tracy flick   reese witherspoon      no matter how many students have come and gone   and disappointed him as an educator   she s the real threat    about to give in   and divulge that she s won by only a lone vote   broderick s mccalister turns in defeat   sees tracy s euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says    no     the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men   no matter how obscure   have in their relationships   a traditional expectation of success   to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry    she can t go higher than him    he won t allow it    and what s amazing about   election   is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor    early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically   and then sexually   involved with a now departed teacher    it s like payne and taylor   his co screenwriter   have taken tracy   a girl desperate for friendship   loyalty   and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers   that they found sitting at the teachers  lunch table more fitting   to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist    and it s amazing the compassion that we have   it seems so real to us   and not merely because it s happened before   splashed all over the front pages   but   because of the all around   nice   persona of these people   we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters    it s with mandy barnett s   if you ll be the teacher   playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most   a final   viscous injection of bittersweet irony    sexuality   though   is not the only basis for payne s satire   or its success    it also makes a telling point about politics   friendship   and class boundaries    satire is required   or ought to be   anyway   to take itself seriously   or act so   while the audience does not    it s a fine line to straddle   but some films ignore it altogether     drop dead gorgeous   leaps infuriatingly to mind      payne and taylor hit the right chord   their characters are real people   neither is perfect   but rather both of the leads are flawed   misguided individuals who retain   somewhat   noble intentions at heart    we sympathize with them   but still   as a satire   their idiosyncratic behavior   and their wrongdoing   is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle   but also reflect and meditate   about    minus half a point   though   for payne admitting not to having seen   ferris bueller s day off      whatever

Pos, at first glance   daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie    on second glance it looks that way too    although   as typical disaster movies go   daylight isn t that bad    admittedly   it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by   think poseidon adventure      but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the   haven t i seen this scene somewhere before      feeling that creeps up all too often during the film    sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york s emergency response team    by sheer luck   he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film       what disaster is that      you ask   as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat    glad you asked    through a whole sequence of entirely probable events   about as probable as hitting the lottery   a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city    the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends   which causes not only massive loss of life   but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel    good old sly   who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses   offers his services to the rescuers   who gladly accept it    sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft   think judge dredd   which he can only go in   and not out off   and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside    so begins the fun   but the fun has to be quick   because this tunnel has started to spring a leak    the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie    not superb by any means   but far above some of his other films   think judge dredd again      daylight s acting is probably average   or a little above   in terms of this sort of genre   starring this particular star    amy brenneman is the only actor of any note   and she does a pretty good job as stallone s reluctant helper    oh yeah   stallone s real life son   sage   is in this too    sage    nice name    i guess it could be worse   he could have been named nutmeg or parsley    note to sage    you are still young    go to school and get a good education    you don t have a future in acting    the plot runs along the same lines as the acting    interesting   but predictable    mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks    the biggest problem with a film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movie    as soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle   another one seems to pop right up   even worse than the last one    i realize that it wouldn t be much of a movie otherwise   but it does make the movie a bit predictable    adding to the predictability is the cast of characters   which of course   has to include at least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way and think the qualified guy   in this case stallone   doesn t know what he is doing    why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other and all work together    would this be too much to ask    can t we all just get along    special effects weren t bad    but i ve certainly seen better    some of the scenes   while fun to watch   were such blatant rip offs that you had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim    especially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater   the tunnel   of course   starts to flood      i really expected gene hackman   roddy mcdowell and ernest borgnine to appear at any minute    i wasn t sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure    i suppose if you have to rip off a movie for good ideas   the poseidon adventure is a good one to use    the underwater sequences   aside from the deja vu   were very well shot and worked fairly well    they were the best part of the movie by a long shot    better than average stallone flick    i realize that s not saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume    but certainly not up to the standards of cliffhanger    daylight is a fun movie   and as long as you aren t expecting a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised

Pos, brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly    since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987   depalma has seen casualties of war   raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames    consequently   it would be easy enough to consider carlito s way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma   reteaming with al pacino   scarface   and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes    it doesn t hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn    carlito s way   while hampered by depalma s characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism   is a truly tense and engrossing drama    carlito brigante   pacino   is a life long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance    in 1975   carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality    he declares himself reformed   tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas    among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld   penn     carlito s crooked attorney and childhood friend   and bodyguard pachanga   luis guzman      carlito rediscovers old flame gail   penelope ann miller     and seems ready to retire in peace    old ways die hard   though   and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can t seem to shake    carlito s way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film    in the first   carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat   the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station    both highlight depalma s gift for choreographed mayhem   and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely    yet for all the viscera   i found the character study even more compelling    carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him   an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit    but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera   there s more of an immediacy to carlito s way   an ever present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion    you sense that there s no way   after so many years   that carlito can stay out of trouble    indeed   he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart     you don t get reformed   you just run out of wind      pacino captures carlito s dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy    sean penn is even better   turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld    a jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys   kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder    he could have been simply pathetic   a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league   but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct    he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink   making the moment he goes over quite jolting    as compelling as the narrative is   viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu    depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors   this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas    he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms   like a 360 degree swing around a kiss   vertigo via body double   and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables    from a story standpoint   there s an obligatory love story with a cliche d long suffering girlfriend character    penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn t do anything new with the role   and eventually she becomes just a distraction   never integrated fully enough into the story    still   it s easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid    the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention   one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn t break    carlito s way plays like a tragic novel   deliberate   confident and powerful    those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well  rewarded    
Pos, by now i figured i d seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half dozen times    not that i m complaining    to call him the   master of suspense   is an understatement    the paradine case   1947     admittedly one of hitchcock s lesser movies   turned out to be one i d missed    this one   like all hitchcock films   is well worth savoring    the story opens with the rich mrs   maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband    as mrs   paradine   alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world    to franz waxman s stark and moody music   we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels    stripped of her fine raiment   she becomes a commoner again   which   as it turns out   was what she was before she met her husband       a brief skirmish   and you ll be lunching at the savoy again     anthony keane   her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting   predicting a fast and easy trial    gregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister       she s no murderess     he argues simplistically   smitten by her beauty       she s too fine a woman      his attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife   gay   ann todd      unlike most hitchcock movies   which are centered on the thriller and the mystery   this one is more a romantic melodrama    typical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light    she deflects her husband s affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client    the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs   paradine s portrait nearby    in the relatively unsatisfying first half   little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires    to the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs   paradine acquitted because   if mrs   paradine dies   his heart will go with her    if she is freed   he will be able to forget her    as part of the soap opera   a mysterious louis jordan plays mr   paradine s valet   who has had some not to be discussed relationships    charles coburn plays anthony s legal partner   sir simon flaquer    and charles laughton   who looks like coburn   is judge lord horfield    this being proper british society   they will all dine together at the judge s house not long before the case begins    court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences   some subtle and others not   between the american and the british judicial systems    one   for example   of which i was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak to his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying    one sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations    as the judge s wife   lady sophie horfield   ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress    the film s only nomination    for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit       so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walk on    at 37 minutes into the film   he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case    don t miss it      in the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom    the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first    watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trial s action    as anthony explains it   the simple case has only 3 possibilities   mr   paradine poisoned himself   mrs   paradine did it   or the valet did it    the end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid    the paradine case runs 1   53    the picture is in black and white    it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested

Pos, director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days   terry gilliam comes to mind as another one      film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story   but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something    but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story    so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential   the film almost automatically deserves a good review    and when they add a fascinating story to it   you have nearly perfect entertainment    fincher s the game is no exception to this    the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time    fincher hasn t made a film since   seven     his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever    so it is about time he made another film    and what a ride it is    the game isn t quite as powerful as   seven     but in some ways it is better    overall   the game could have used a little more clarity   or a little more uncertainty    it walks a line of insanity and reality   but it never goes either way until the very end    the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events   and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight    unfortunately   unlike   the usual suspects     we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening   whether it be true or false    however   this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent    the game is told completely from its main character s point of view    nicholas van orton   michael douglas   is a high strung and isolated businessman    he lives alone in his giant mansion   divorced from his wife elizabeth   and is celebrating his 48th birthday   the same age at which his father committed suicide at   in the same mansion    for his 48th birthday   conrad   sean penn     the rebel of the family   gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs   consumer recreation services       it will make your life fun again     his brother promises    as skeptical as nicholas is   he is somewhat intrigued   and annoyed by the lack of information  something this businessman hates    seeing a billboard in an office   he decides to visit the mysterious company    jim feingold   james rebhorn   greets nicholas and guides him through the sign up process   which consists of psych tests   physicals   emotional responses   and other mind games       each game is suited to each person s emotional and psychological needs     explains feingold    one day   nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests    even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up   he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company    what he doesn t realize is that the game has already begun    the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas  way    how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive    the detail involved in fincher s shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them    with   seven     fincher had almost every single shot mean something    he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to    compared to   seven     though   the game is light and comical    because of this film s sense of humor and self awareness   nothing can be taken quite seriously    so don t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game   because it doesn t want you to    what does make sense is the final revelation  when everything becomes apparent and clear    if taken as it is   the game s ending makes complete sense    but if you try and critique every minute detail   then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility    perhaps that is the reason i docked the film    while trying to remain realistic and plausible   the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen    we don t really care if douglas  character lives or not because it isn t believable    the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously   but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is   you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller    michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas    douglas has played lonely businessmen before   but here he adds another level to his performance    his character   who is normally level headed and relies on facts   is forced to trust nobody    can he believe the waitress he bumped into    what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place    douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well   and gives one of his best performances   even better than his   falling down   persona      the supporting cast is essential in this film   and casting was critical    sean penn is always good   and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas  brother    deborah kara unger   from   crash     is the waitress he bumps into   and her performance is extremely good    in fact   she almost steals the film from douglas    james rebhorn portrays his character very well   and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas  predicament    another good performance comes from armin mueller stahl   from   shine     as the book editor    but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game   he not only commands this cast   but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life    the game is rated r for language   violence   some gore   and some nudity and drugs    what is essential for this film to work is the writing    john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue   and some very funny moments    this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects  did    however   the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot    and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen   you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year s best films    
Pos, every once in a while   a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise    i don t necessarily mean in terms of quality   rather   i m referring to the mere knowledge of its existence    usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance   but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo    it has slipped rather quietly into limited release   and appears destined to slip out just as quietly    that s a shame   because princess caraboo is a delightful fable   romantic   gentle and very appealing    what s more   it s surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp witted lesson in english social history    princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england   involving a young woman   phoebe cates   who is found wandering the countryside    apparently unable to speak any english   she is taken in by good hearted gentlewoman mrs   worrall   wendy hughes      her banker husband   jim broadbent   is none too pleased about this strange houseguest   until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island   the princess caraboo    this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr   worrall   and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs   worrall    however   local journalist john gutch   stephen rea   is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be   and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo    as a social satire and comedy of manners   princess caraboo is a winner    it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars   and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing    but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr   worrall   a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude    he is worse than one of the idle rich   he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them   and since the house and money are all from mrs   worrall   he is a bit too close to them for comfort    while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule   director and co writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light hearted to be heavy handed    he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes   as the princess becomes a   sensation   at court    in one of the film s best sequences   princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent   a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions     and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance    it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in   sensations     an idea that takes on a timeless quality   and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show      social commentary aside   princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment    the performers are mostly delightful   particularly phoebe cates   who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime    her supporting players are also appealing   wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs   worrall   kevin kline as frixos   the worralls  suspicious and superior greek butler   stephen rea as the world weary but ultimately romantic gutch    only john lithgow is a disappointment   turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess s identity    the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt   without becoming gimmicky    it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn t given more time to develop   because the potential seemed to be there    when it finally does blossom   it seems too quick to be plausible    princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp    still   it has both escapist and intellectual appeal   and is well worth seeking out    it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding  a hidden gem    
Neg, gordie boggs   arquette   aptly cast as a moron   as he is one   and his best friend sean dawkins   scott caan    the son of james caan should not be reduced to garbage like this !   are two losers from wyoming with no jobs and no girlfriends   who look up to world championship wrestling champion jimmy king   a terribly casted oliver platt     as he is everything they are not    they finally get to see him live and he is screwed out of his title by the evil   ruthless promoter titus sinclair   a wasted palitaliano   in a role originally meant for real life wcw president eric bischoff   whose name was written all over the role !      gordie and sean track down king in atlanta and discover that he is not really the english king the wcw writers created for him   but a drunken   ignorant southerner who is as irritated by these two lunkheads as bob newhart was by larry   darryl   and darryl    they sneak him back onto wcw tv   after which sinclair agrees to book him in a steel cage match in las vegas at wcw s next pay per view   against his rival   diamond dallas page    if he wins   king gets his title and his career back   plus one million dollars    wcw president eric bischoff   knowing his promotion was desperate with bad writing and ratings skyrocketing down thanks to the far superior world wrestling federation   came up with the idea for this movie hoping it would save wcw    he was then fired and rehired two months ago   but by the time he d left   they had already been contracted to do the film   and bischoff could not play sinclair   which   in itself   is for the best   as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming knows that bischoff is no actor !      the characters of gordie and sean show you exactly what eric bischoff thinks of his fans    he thinks of them as young   dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything that will be put out in front of them is real    that is why he doesn t take the fans into consideration when he books a nitro or a pay per view    i have news for you   eric   no wrestling fan in this day and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling isn t for show   unless they are four years old    this is 2000   you know   not 1985    bischoff will try to cover up criticism like that by saying it is a comedy   but i have no doubt in my mind that if this had been a dramatic   rocky style film   which it probably should have been    professional wrestling is ridiculed enough as it is   why should the first wrestling movie in ten years be a comedy       gordie and sean would have been portrayed in the same light    anybody who has seen the documentary wrestling with shadows   documenting wwf owner vince mcmahon s double crossing of bret hart   will probably realize via the reviews and previews of ready to rumble   that it is basically a rip off of that film s storyline with the poor man s wayne and garth thrown in for comedic affect    you can tell titus sinclair is supposed to poke fun at vince   but any self respecting wrestling fan knows that sinclair is more inspired by bischoff than vince   and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart    all of these aspects of the film   needless to say   seriously offended me as a wrestling fan    another thing i found disturbing about the film was the romance between gordie and nitro girl sasha   the lovely rose mcgowan      wouldn t it have been easier to bring something new into the relationship rather than revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclair s insistance    i hate that cliche !  the world wrestling federation would have made a better film    they are the promotion everyone cares about   they are winning the ratings   they have better wrestlers   and they take their fans into consideration and don t treat fans like morons    so   vince   how about a movie    
Neg, i can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stone s `any given sunday     it s an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rock em   sock em profession of pro football    unfortunately   the director seems to have only one priority on his mind   sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers    in altering each frame with quick flash photography and dizzying   in your face editing   stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible character development and football politics    we see glimpses of greatness   but `any given sunday  has its agenda all tangled in technical gobbledy gook    it grows tiresome and monotonous    yes   stone has pulled a brian depalma    matters of importance are pushed aside right from the get go    tony d amato   al pacino     coach of the struggling miami sharks   finds his team stuck in a losing rut    aging quarterback cap rooney   dennis quaid   appears to be losing his touch   and d amato can t seem to ignite any passion in his squad    when cap is injured on the field   and after a patch of unlikely events occur   third string qb willie beaman   jamie foxx   is brought into the game    once in the huddle   and this becomes an in game ritual     beaman horks all over the field    nerves   you see    eventually though   the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates   sparking his rise to fame in the football world   the endorsements   the music videos   etc     and stone straps us in for the jolting ride of behind the scenes stress and fury that the business is apparently like    and i believe it    there is some intriguing insight posed   but in the big scheme of things   stone fumbles the ball    the problem with the director s visual approach is this   he uses extravagant editing devices when a more conventional approach would have been appropriate    football is an exciting game to watch   but stone seems to think dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add to the adrenaline rush    i guess he is mistaken    `any given sunday  is a visual kaleidoscope that leaves the audience in a frustrated stupor more frequently than it excites them    many football fans   including one i attended with   are liable to be disappointed with the `ultra stylish  way stone has decided to present the game    in return   a three star film becomes unfortunately degraded due to the director s tampering    in welcome scenes when the visual pummeling comes to a break   this actually shows decent character development and interaction    for instance   heated returns between d amato and feisty young owner christina pagniacci   cameron diaz   are enjoyable to watch    there is also a solid performance from jamie foxx   who experiments with great success in his first trek into dramatic territory    the stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine   aaron eckhart   lauren holly   ann margret and charlton heston   in an extraordinarily brief appearance      unfortunately   too many big names are wasted   a typical demise for a film with such a large and experienced cast    pacino makes some interesting progress with his character    you begin to identify with coach d amato and the morals he is striving for          but i often felt he was just another play thing stone could weave in and out of his editing dynamics    `any given sunday  is a watchable but disappointing sports film in which plot and characters take a back seat to excessive filmmaking technique    and a very distant back seat   at that    
Neg, i want to be involved in show business one day    and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse    this movie proves it for me    i was a little worried about the last batman film   as i thought joel schumaccer   taking over from tim burton   would screw it up    i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne    they didn t    kilmer did a good job   and the cast was left to carry the movie   which they did   even jim carrey as the riddler and i can t stand jim carrey     because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles    this film is different    the cast is still impressive   but here   not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction   he s one of those directors who s good with actors   terrible with camera angles     but writer akiva goldsmith doesn t really give an impressive cast anything to do    the cast is impressive   clooney is a surprisingly good wayne/batman   o donnell is a crafty robin as usual   they could ve casted somebody better as batgirl   my friend likes neve campbell     but silverstone is not bad   and thurman is a good poison ivy    the major problem is schwarzenegger   who is a terrible freeze    his accent is so heavy   you can t understand what he says   and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act   and they know it   but they figure that if they flex their muscles   say a limited amount of stuff   and kill a bunch of guys   then they figure nobody ll notice    that s the trouble with me   * i * notice    schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney   or as much money as he got for this   but hollywood thinks he does    patrick stewart was the person i d heard that was considered to play freeze   and he would ve been so much better    or sean connery   but not arnold   i m not an actor   but i play one in real life   schwarzenegger    i realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film   but it would ve been nice if they d casted a star that had talent for the role    akiva goldsmith s screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film    in a regular batman film   they d concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more   but elle macpherson s julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is    there is talk of a fifth batman movie    my interest to see it is low   but i hope it s better than this    if you don t want to waste your time   rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster    any other    
Neg, in the past   tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman   and the hilarious ed wood   but lately his films just don t cut it    sleepy hollow has some unique features   but the script is a terrible mess    for those who remember disney s fantastic   adventures of ichabod crane     it is actually superior to this    disney s version was at least interesting   while burton s film drags on far too long   without any suspense or frights    while the stories are similar   the new version adds too much to the once likable story   and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off    ichabod crane   johnny depp   is now apparently a constable   who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders    the victims are headless   and no traces of evidence were found   until the murderer reveals himself   hence the headless horseman    now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy   they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree   that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow    sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character   but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster    in the original   the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable    no one could stop him   not even ichabod    by the end of the film   it had audiences in deep thought    burton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere   and how to make the main characters heroes    he takes no risk what so ever   and this is where he fails    another pathetic element of the film was the script    like i said earlier   he just stuffed too much in at one time   and made it look real sloppy   kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims    he completely butchered the story to pieces    thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked    the acting by depp was quite notable    he took the nerdy character of the cartoon   and simply acted it out in a better manner    if it wasn t for his quirky one liners   i doubt i could have remained awake   because quite frankly i was getting sleepy    just when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress   she winds up doing this    it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster    it s too tempting to let go   even if the script is mush    the atmosphere too was quite involving    i should have just gazed at the sets   and the eerie fog   rather than actually pay attention to what was going on    at least burton s films are eye candy   even if they are trash    the only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads   and the fight between the horseman   depp and casper van dien    other than that   i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film   and just sit back and stare at the scenery    by the end   i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed    this is the biggest disappointment of the year   especially when such a talented director like burton handles a project like this    don t waste your time or money   because your head will feel hollow    
Pos, it was only a matter of time before a dilbert esque office comedy hit the screens    however   rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams   office space is instead based on the work of another animator   mike judge   creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill    in his live action directoral debut   judge aptly spoofs corporate culture    the story is certainly not very involved   but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps    peter   ron livingston   is a programmer working at the initech corporation    every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before       in  other words   every day is the worst day in his entire life    he s stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors   all obsessed with administrative trivialities    he s smitten with joanna   jennifer aniston     a local waitress   but hasn t the guts to even introduce himself    everything has simply made him a complete   nervous wreck    but all of that changes when   after an unintentionally over effective visit to a hypnotherapist   peter loses all of his inhibitions    he realizes his lifelong dream   to do absolutely nothing    he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss   bill lumbergh   gary cole     doing whatever he feels like    peter s friends and co workers   samir   ajay naidu   and michael bolton   david herman         no    not that michael bolton   are perplexed by their friend s sudden change in attitude    but   they have larger things to worry about   rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing        as bleak as much of this sounds   let me assure you that office space is a comedy   and quite a funny one    although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip   office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life    each mundane detail   taken by itself   seems completely   regrettably   plausible    yet   when combined into a whole   the picture which results is absolutely surreal    ron livingston tackles his role straight faced   and becomes much funnier because of it    his character isn t simply being a clown lampooning around the office   but rather seems possessed by a zen like clarity    he is operating on a higher plane   where everything suddenly makes sense   and from this vantage point   he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life    anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy   or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life   will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film    in fact   in addition to being wildly humorous   the film may actually prove to be cathartic    the animated roots of office space show in the film s lack of complexity    most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk    one employee   milton   stephen root     is practically a flesh and blood cartoon    however   despite their simple nature   the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny    it s not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film   though the situations may seem exceedingly far fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are      the film is flimsy and absurd   but also very funny    
Pos, jacques tati s 1953 classic   les vacances de m   hulot     also known as   mr   hulot s vacation     in english   ought to be the textbook on how to do non   dialogue comedy in film    the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly   and the film operates on the paper   thin premise that monsieur hulot   played by tati himself   is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week s vacation    yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory    part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags    slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy   but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced   you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don t watch where they re going    in   les vacances de m   hulot     the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low key    in one sequence   for example   hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when   while his back is turned   the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves   washes away   then comes back up on the other side of the boat    while crossing over to get the can   hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it    when he actually takes the boat out into the water   it breaks in half   but the two halves flip up against each other   trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues    tati doesn t waste a single opportunity for humor   scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film    it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience s expectations   and   les vacances de m   hulot   succeeds brilliantly in that area as well    tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement    when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume   no fights or shouting matches ensue   instead   the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room   disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark    tati also uses running gags to this effect   allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would   more often than not   we can see them coming and think     oh   he s not going to do that again     but   lo and behold   he does    for example   there is a recurring joke in which hulot s noisy   sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel s lights coming on one by one    then this image turns up again in the finale   which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce    the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four star film as opposed to merely an above average   clever comedy    as much as i was laughing during this film   i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience   suffice it to say that he did    the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters    it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him   alternatively   it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons    instead   tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them   however strange or irritating they might seem       les vacances de m   hulot   is not subtitled   but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events    anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store    note     les vacances de m   hulot   was not rated by the mpaa    it would at most receive a pg rating

Pos, pulp fiction   quentin tarantino s anxiously awaited and superb follow up to reservoir dogs   is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about   loved   and hated films of all time    in all fairness   it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it    as if reservoir dogs wasn t perfect   tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction   a fast paced   hard talking   roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way    every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor    to begin with   the two hit men   vincent vega   john travolta   and jules winnfield   samuel l   jackson      these two characters work together perfectly   and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect    travolta   in fact   is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role    if these two characters were not enough   there s the struggling boxer butch coolidge   bruce willis     the two small time criminals pumpkin   tim roth   and honey bunny   amanda plummer     the big man in charge marsellus wallace   ving rhames   and his attractive young wife mia   uma thurman     and the   problem solver   himself   the wolf   harvey keitel      these are just the major characters    smaller roles   but equally terrific   are handed to jimmie   quentin tarantino     a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business   lance   eric stoltz     the far out drug dealer   as well as maynard   duane whitaker   and zed   peter greene     two hillbillies who are the men   behind     no pun intended for those of you who have seen this   a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film    the film interweaves three stories that   at first   seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other    the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold ups    the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop   unknowing of what lies ahead    after this   the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle    utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue   the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants    the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss   marsellus wallace    after basically toying with the men   especially the unfortunate brett   frank whaley     vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase    this is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a   357     hand cannon     shooting at the two gangsters    he somehow completely misses them   leading jules to cite divine intervention    this is also the basis for more of the now famous tarantino dialogue    the film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades    butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight   but when he does not   marsellus vows to find him   wherever he is   and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune    vincent   meanwhile   has the honor of taking marsellus  wife   mia   out on a date while the big man is out of town    vincent   obviously   is rather nervous about this   especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage    after their date   which seems to rather smoothly   things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent s high priced heroin   dubbed a   monster   by lance    each story continually progresses   and new and amazing events occur    eventually   the stories all meet each other in the end   with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant   which happens to contain both vincent and jules    pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade   and possibly of all time    along with its superb dialogue   action   writing   directing   and acting   this film will not only latch onto you   but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you    and with most fans of this movie   this is proved to be a rather easy task   although at times the graphic images   violence   and language may seem a bit overpowering    surely   quentin tarantino s fame was greatly escalated by this film   and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon    
Neg, say   tell me if you ve seen this before   a crisis on board a commercial airliner causes a stewardess to have to fly and land the plane herself    airport  97 anyone    ray liotta is a psychotic serial killer being transported from new york to california on christmas eve    amazingly   on what would seemingly be a busy day of travel on one of the most flown routes   only about six other passengers are on the flight    anyway   they take off   liotta escapes and kills all the police and the pilots   and stewardess lauren holly locks herself in the cockpit to fly the plane    the story is beyond routine   the script is embarrassing   at one point   this jumbo jet is flying completely upside down     the characters are worthless   and the performances are annoying    surprisingly   co writer steven e   de souza actually wrote the first two   die hard   movies !     turbulence   takes place at christmas time   yet the film was released a few days after the holidays    brilliant marketing   as no one cares about anything having to do with christmas after december 26th    the studio knew they had a bomb   and purposely dumped it out when the fewest number of people would see it    [r]  
Pos, the long kiss goodnight   r   meryl streep tried it and failed    even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well bared assets    however   geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight   a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband   renny harlin    davis plays samantha caine   a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years    with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey   samuel l   jackson     she slowly remembers  and reclaims  her past as charly baltimore   tough as nails cia operative    needless to say   with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no goodniks out to erase more than her memory    shane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script   i m not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag   but for what it s worth   it delivers the goods    like black s previous work   such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout   the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny   quirky dialogue    the humor especially works well in this case   for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously    but there s no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell   who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car        while ice skating    jackson and davis make a good team    jackson is funny as ever as ever   in fact   his spirited line deliveries   especially when he first appears   are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction    as good as he is   the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis   who shows much promise as an action heroine    what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn t take herself too seriously    she is obviously in on the joke   slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation    this is not to say that she doesn t need work  sometimes she lays on the   toughness   a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature    but should the public embrace the film and   in turn   the notion of a kick ass female   davis could have found her special niche    it seems as if davis and harlin s first collaboration   the middling pirate epic cutthroat island   was just a dress rehearsal   albeit a very costly one   for long kiss   in which the wife husband team hit their action stride    anyone simply looking for a fun   escapist entertainment that requires little to no thinking will find this film to be a more than welcome kiss    
Neg, the main problem with martin lawrence s pet project   a thin line between love and hate   like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man   is that his character is an irresponsible jerk   and if that is the case   it doesn t seem to do anything except justify the woman s actions    that is especially the case in lawrence s darnell wright    he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long    now don t think i condone this just because i m male    my philosophy is   if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful   kind girl   you should treat her like a princess and respect her    darnell doesn t think like this    he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them    and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target   beautiful   wealthy brandi web   played nicely by whitfield   who runs a successful real estate business   is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia   king     i found myself thinking     i m supposed to feel sorry for this guy      after all   it is largely darnell s fault    if he is lining up all these women   you d think he d have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day   as his mother says it does    but he doesn t   so you get the sense that he s not only irresponsible   but also pretty dumb    you especially get this sense that he s dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her       i d put my pants on in two seconds after that !    now   brandi is a psycho bitch   but it s hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage    one final flaw   though   is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with    brandi is a classy   intelligent woman with an mba from harvard   who initally resists darnell s   immature play   as she calls it   as any woman like her would in real life    but all of a sudden she says yes    but when you listen to darnell s four letter word vocabulary watch his actions   you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period   much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him !  lawrence can be good when he wants to   but in order to prove it   he needs to let other people write and direct his movies    look at this movie    four writers   as a result it s too long   two hours   when it could ve easily worked at ninety minutes !   and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came   which makes me think the writers didn t get along     all of which isn t necessary    there are some bright spots   though    whitfield   regina king   della reese   and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts   and they help it out a lot    and there are some funny parts   like   for example   the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property     but they re just not enough to sustain the film

!  but   with gritted teeth   i managed to get over that    this sequel will not leave fans disappointed   it s more often than not a laugh riot    and   i look optimistically to the future   where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection    if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas   we should be in store for much more       c   1999   jamey hughton                                                  jamey hughton   15   has written a weekly column in the starphoenix   saskatoon   sk since november   1997    he was a 1999 writing finalist in the canadian ytv achievement awards

Pos,    you ll go ape over tarzan because it s more fun than a barrel of monkeys !    okay   there s the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie    disney s latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning   skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship    father   mother   and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins   and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson    it s amazing   the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack    before you know it   an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala   glenn close     a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard    against the wishes of her mate and family leader   kerchak   lance henricksen     she takes on the infant boy as her own    tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild    much of tarzan s young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his   father     which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well meant his attempts    all he s looking for is acceptance   perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers   but one which will ring true with a lot of adults    when you really think about it   this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end    look back on past disney animated features and you ll see the trend    growing up   tarzan   voiced by alex d   linz as a child   and by tony goldwyn as an adult   has a couple of friends    one is an ape named terk   rosie o donnell     and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor   wayne knight      both provide the requisite comic relief   timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind   and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold    i m beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films    just fill in the blanks !  can you see it       now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief   but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it    we ve already had a fish and a crab   and we ve had a candle and a teapot   a genie and a dog   a few stone statues         have  we had an ape and an elephant yet    well   there we go !    of course   there s gotta be romance somewhere along the line   so jane   minnie driver   gets introduced about halfway through    together with her father dr   porter   nigel hawthorne   and the big game hunter clayton   brian blessed     jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa    she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately   and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory   you tarzan   me jane   scene    thankfully   those aren t the exact words    however   i found it distracting that tarzan is going   ohh ohh ee ee   one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction    how does he tell his name to another ape       ohh ohh ee   tarzan   ee ee ohh      well   regardless of my picky nature   the romance actually works as only disney romance can   purely contrived   but for some reason rather believable    but hey   tarzan s a young adult    do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane    isn t that illegal in most countries    oh   well    i don t think disney will be using my quote anymore    tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical    there s lots of music to be sure   but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time    we instead get more of a phil collins concert   as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material    this isn t really a bad thing   as the songs are very high energy and catchy   i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day     it s just different    do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system   because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie    with each new feature   disney animation gets even better    not necessarily by leaps and bounds   but since they put out a new film each year   a steady rate of improvement is apparent   and this definitely shows in tarzan    there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3 d effect   and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying    the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers   and had me thinking this isn t just tarzan   it s   extreme tarzan      however   tarzan does not seem to have what i call its   chandelier scene     which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort   utilizing a computer assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking    lasting but a few seconds at most   it s been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast   in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail    as usual   the voice talent is up to snuff   convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters    the one poor choice in casting   however   was rosie o donnell    going into the film   i didn t know she was even a part of it   but when terk started talking   i recognized her voice immediately    her performance was fine   but through the rest of the film i kept thinking     that s no boy ape   that rosie o donnell      distracting to say the least    i ll admit i ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story   tarzan of the apes     so i couldn t tell you how true this film stays to the book    but unless you re a purist   you should have few objections to this film    with solid performances   action   adventure   a bit of romance   and great music and animation   tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us    note   when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago   i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature    this time   i ll just say that i went to mcdonald s yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry   and tarzan was on the cup     nuff said    
Pos, a fully loaded entertainment review   website coming in july !  >from ace ventura to truman burbank   jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic   yet sympathetic   characters    1996 s the cable guy was supposed to be his big   breakthrough   role from zany humor into darker   more dramatic acting    as most everyone knows   the results were   well   less than stellar    not only did the film not do so hot at the box office   but it was also panned by critics    as far as i know   gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it    the first time i saw the cable guy   in theatres   i was in super critic mode   and didn t really like it    however   due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day   i ve had time to lean back   relax   and take in the film    and to my surprise   it grew on me    the plot is rather simple   broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy   played by carrey   then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship    see   steven s been having some problems with his girlfriend   robin   leslie mann     and he doesn t think he has any more room in his life for a new friend    also   some of the cable guy s antics have been creeping him out    carrey   as the cable guy   gives steven various aliases   which later we find out are all tv characters   larry tate   chip douglas   ricky ricardo   etc   he apparently lives in his cable van   and while many critics didn t enjoy this newer   darker   less manic performance from carrey   i thought it was interesting and rather well done    for me   its not the movie as a whole that s enjoyable   but rather several individual scenes   a karaoke jam at steven s apartment   a medieval fight at a theme restaurant   and a bathroom beating   a la liar   liar     just to name a few    perhaps the fact that more of carrey s humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny    and if you really want to see something   you ve got to hear his version of jefferson airplane s   somebody to love     sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam    the cable guy has its bad spots   like most any movie    i didn t particularly like steven s girlfriend   and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend    also   the ending   while having you fooled for a moment   is rather contrived   and somewhat dissapointing    still   i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture   if you re at the video store and can t think of anything to rent   i suggest you try it out    or if you have hbo   just wait till it comes on   you won t have to wait long      hell   that s what i do every day    
Neg, as a hot shot defense attorney   kevin lomax   keanu reeves   has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients    he is also an excellent judge of character   knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness s testimony    and   on top of that   he s a damn good trial lawyer    in the opening scene   it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty   but it doesn t hamper lomax s desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt   thereby getting an acquittal    his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country   headed by john milton   al pacino      he is brought to their headquarters in nyc   where he immediately impresses milton   and is subsequently offered a full time position as head of their newly created criminal law division    lomax is soon given the case of his life    he must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide    the draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell    he works late   defends the guilty   pledges his soul to his firm   and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife   mary ann   charlize theron      but what starts off as a promising john grisham like story about conscience stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story    it begins like a typical parable where a small town boy makes it big   but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money   power   and greed    but milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm    quite literally   he is the devil in disguise   and as the movie progresses   he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago    freaky and frightening things begin to happen   and after much of the film has elasped   milton s horrifying intent is finally revealed    the movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts    the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big city trial lawyer    the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax    unfortunately   the two never mix well into a cohesive story   and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere    granted   the film is very handsome looking    you ll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino    you ll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties    you ll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann   knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away    this was one of the better storylines   but unfortunately   is only a sub plot    as with all thing s involving the devil   you can expect nothing but the worst    in the first few scenes   reeves anchors the film   but then slowly drifts into the background    his path from self vanity to self consciousness is never fully explored    his actions seem arbitrary   and his reasons for them not fully known    pacino s comical portrayal is spirited   but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie    there is another plot or two that is introduced   but never gets revisited    the focus seemed inconsistent throughout   and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap    this movie tries to be horrifying   thrilling   and dramatic all at the same time    however   while the devil s advocate strives to get noticed   ultimately it makes very little impression at all    
Pos, david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head    it is one of many science fiction films   released during the last year of this millenium   that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future    the story unfolds in a near future   where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs    the world of the future is an unfriendly place   where the scared inhabitants are   hiding   in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world    allegra geller   jennifer jason leigh     the leading game designer in the world   is testing her new virtual reality game   existenz with a focus group    as they begin   she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun    she flees with a young marketing trainee   ted pikul   jude law     who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard    unfortunately   her pod   an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program   is damaged    to inspect it   she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her    the events leading up to this   and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn t exist   as the   players   are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot    here the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game s perspective    i don t intend to reveal more of the film s premise   which is structured as a computer game   with   tasks   that the characters must complete to win the game    released after   the matrix   and   dark city       existenz   has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films    however     existenz   is moving in a different direction   with a premise of its own    a combination of dazzling special effects   brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot   made   the matrix   a rare and entertaining science fiction experience   with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade       existenz   has a completely different atmosphere   resembling   dark city     which is darker   more serious and less entertaining       existenz   has the opportunities and potential   but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored    after the engaging beginning   it starts to falter    while i was watching the film   many left the theatre during the first hour    and indeed     existenz   seemed as a complete failure   the actors seemed unreal   the plot and dialogue silly   unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another    but the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level   explaining all past events   the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes    and jet the film fails on several issues    probably the best written character in the story is a game designer   who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world   than face real life    this is a great possibility to create a magnificent character   and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg s script to the limits   but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown    existenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies    it is not a world worth sacrificing your life for    it s a cold   dark place where the   players   are forced to interrelate with unreal characters   eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will    it doesn t look like a place worth even thinking about    david cronenberg has been the creator of   the fly       videodrome   and   the dead zone     so it s not so hard to guess that   existenz   is a violent and gory film    besides the regular murders of innocent people   the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two headed mutated amfibium    scenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can t make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures    the way i see it   this is the film s crucial failure    it is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time   space and problems of our everyday life do not exist   a place of blooming blossoms   green forests and clear waters   a place really worth sacrificing your life for    because of its lack of three dimensionality   the film looses most of its possibilities   but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes   amusing performances   especially by willem dafoe   and one interesting and important thought   depicted in many different ways throughout the movie    during the film   the audience is as confused as the characters   detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created       the matrix     despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts   ends with a light at the end of the tunnel       existenz   does not    it is a one time experience   ending in blood   gore and madness   a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow    
Pos, do you want to know the truth about cats and dogs    do you    well   as this movie shows us   they make good companions but pale in comparison to the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring    unfortunately   there s a giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certain people can get through while the rest of us mill around outside   feeling sorry for ourselves    a checkpoint beautiful kind of thing   and janeane garafolo s character abby relates to it well    like a certain oversized teenage movie critic   she is intelligent and has a great sense of humor but strikes out with the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive   and the men seem to be backing her up on that    meanwhile   her gorgeous neighbor nora   uma thurman        uma being the only woman s name worse than nora   attracts men like flies    as abby tells her     you burp and they think it s cute    you barf and they line up to hold your hair back      but nora s down on herself for being too shallow and superficial    we all have our prwhen a man calls in to veterinarian abby s talk radio show wanting to know how to get the roller skates off his basset hound       oh come on   any idiot knows how to handle that problem !    he likes her personality and professional demeanor and asks to meet her in person    abby   though   knows her body doesn t match her personality and that she probably won t have a chance with him once he sees her    so she gives him nora s body description and stands him up    nora happens to be in the studio the next day when the dog man comes by and abby asks her for a big favor    she goes along with the masquerade and the three of them head out for a night of fun   abby assuming the role of a goat cheese farmer named donna    the dog man finds out even though this girl is beautiful   she s not quite as intellectual or confident about herself in person   but he doesn t suspect anything   realizing he s not living in a   three s company   episode    the charade continues   with abby furthering the relationship over the phone   including a decidedly unnecessary phone sex/masturbation sequence   and nora furthering it in person   while eventually finding herself attracted to the dog man    like sleepless in seattle   this comedy/romance is predictable all the way through   but we care enough about the characters that we root them on and will the romance to blossom    the truth about cats and dogs isn t quite as entertaining as i was expecting it to be   but it handles well a theme i could identify with    the thing is   i find janeane garafolo rather attractive    she s no uma but i m sure in real life she d have no problems attracting men    i   on the other hand   couldn t attract a man to save my life        and am rather proud of that fact    
Pos, i hate to burst your bubble   but after all the star power   mega bucks   screenwriters   directors   and cool trailers   men in black is not the best movie of the summer    it s pretty good in it s own right   yes   but i would probably split the   best movie   honors among face/off   spawn   con air   and maybe event horizon    it s main problem is that it s quickly forgettable   and i can t remember one truly good scene from it    from con air   it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt    in spawn   it was the   living room hell   conclusion at the end    in event horizon   it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell s forces    and all of face/off was pretty dang good    but as for men in black   the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches    i remember it not for it s humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted    and yes   i did see mimic   which is something i ll touch on in a later review    back to men in black   is it just me   or does that sound funny      i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard   etc     for those of you who aren t comic geeks   wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars   what the new yorker is to high society   what boy s life is to boy scots    okay   that one was pretty pathetic      few people know this   but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was   while not honest politician rare   very hard to find    this was after the release of the high grossing batman forever   and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o donnell were being considered for the roles   in the comic book   there were no black men in black    kind of weird   huh      all i can say is   thank god they didn t cast chris o donnell    i know i can t be the only person on the planet who thinks he s an annoying   preppie little snot        sorry    my apologies to o donnell fans    i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him   anticipating rather craftily that   if the movie was a big hit   it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely    he decided not to sell them to me   because they were   innappropriate      hmm          so now you re probably wondering why i ve wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years    good question    i ll move on to the movie now    as you probably already know   will smith and tommy lee jones   agents k and j   respectively   belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5   or it s nickname mib   men in black      men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear   and they re mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they re here on earth    not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven t seen this movie   but a basically big roach type bug lands in a redneck farmer s yard   inhabits his body   and attempts to destroy the entire universe    not bad   eh     i have no idea why i just typed that    i m not even really paying attention anymore      the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black    i found their main headquarters to be boring   as were the   cool weapons   they had    the noisy cricket just plain sucked   no matter what anyone said    and the movie definitely surprised me in tone   although it probably shoudln t have    it s director   barry sonnenfield   is known for   black humor     directing both addams family movies    this movie was basically a   black comedy     not an action/sci fi like i expected from the trailers    don t get me wrong on what i think of this movie    it s not bad   i gave it * * *    it was mostly entertaining throughout it s run   and had a very good ending   although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it    my diagnosis for this picture   a good weekend rental   but not worth a movie ticket    of course   the movie is now long gone from theaters   but that s beside the point    i think    
Neg, it s a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise    the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying    osmosis jones is crude   gross   disgusting   and was directed by the farrelly brothers   the twisted siblings behind there s something about mary   me   myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt    not that there s anything wrong with scatology    i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor   such as it was    it s merely that with osmosis jones   the farrellys humor is too juvenile   too predictable    you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn    osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho    the trouble is   the animation may please the very young   but the jokes may be over their heads   while the teen age audience may find it too tame for their tastes    adults   well   let s just say most will find it unappetizing    osmosis jones plays like a 100 minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby    the live action sequences revolve around frank   bill murray     who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe    he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower    frank   much to the consternation of his daughter   is a fast food addict   eating anything   and everything   that can kill you    he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner   and presumably smell better   than he does    frank s body is invaded by thrax   a lethal virus   after frank eats a hard boiled egg that had fallen to the ground    it s not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth    nope   the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg   wresting it from the primate s mouth    like i said   the gross meter tips the scales on this one    after ingesting the egg   the movie begins its animated sequences    here   osmosis jones   voiced by chris rock     a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix   voiced by frasier s david hyde pierce     a 12 hour   painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax   smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne      basically   what we have is a cliched cop buddy movie   rife with all the clich   s of that genre    and this is why osmosis jones doesn t click    it merely falls back on tired   familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations    the jokes and puns are lame   osmosis searches out a snitch   a former flu virus    after pumping him for information   drix tells osmosis     funny   he doesn t look fluish      and the jokes don t rise above that level    the live action scenes are no better    frank is such a slob   so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child    he s almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters    osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left    the animation is rather two dimensional and flat    it lacks scope and depth    it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head   and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater    
Pos, let s say you live at the end of an airport runway    large jetliners continuously pass over your house   rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace    let s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances   and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home    now let s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway   and offers you more than it s worth    wouldn t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed    of course you would    but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise   and the house your castle    that s what they are to darryl kerrigan   michael caton     and although he s happy that a multi national corporation would like to buy his home   sorry   it s not for sale    unfortunately   the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government   which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice    not about to take this lying down   darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto   tiriel mora   and makes a determined   albeit pathetic   attempt to fight back    the castle   an australian comedy by rob sitch   is perhaps one of the simplest movies i ve seen in recent memory   yet also one of the funniest    in fact   it is this film s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful    the good guys and the bad guys are clear   the humor is straightforward   and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets    it s the perfect setup for a relaxing   hilarious good time   and as much as i hate to admit it   i liked the fact that i didn t have to think all that much while watching this film    i just sat back and enjoyed myself    the situation is one we ve seen before   regular joe fights back against the government   or big business   or whatever    what makes this film different is its characters    darryl thinks he s got the best life in the world   he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind   he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal   anne tenny     and he swells with pride when his son dale   stephen curry   digs a hole in the yard    steve kerrigan   anthony simcoe   constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for   investments   like jousting sticks and overhead projectors   while wayne kerrigan is in jail   as a result of dennis denuto s incompetent courtroom maneuvers    the great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren t so stupid that they get annoying    they re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing    we look upon them with a little bit of pity   but a whole lot of affection    screenwriters sitch   santo cilauro   tom gleisner   and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate   further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans    sympathy for their situation   the laughter they bring us   and the family s wonderful characterization   simple as it may be   leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them    i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans   but trust me   it works    i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs    don t get me wrong   slapstick   when executed well   can be genius    it s just that too often   a film will resort to it s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience   not always successfully    instead   the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world    when they are by themselves   the are funny   and when they are with normal people   they are hilarious    one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though    the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film s running time    luckily   it s a funny little detour that   while slightly distracting from the film s main drive   is still quite enjoyable    with all the levity abound in the castle   the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept   that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property   an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes    i m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life   but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution   of australia   and certainly sounds impressive at any rate    and   for that matter   it s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this    
Pos, quiz show   an almost perfectly accurate true story   is based upon the events of the popular television show of the mid 50 s     twenty one      on this trivial game show   contestants were placed in isolation booths and then answered questions corresponding to a category of their choice   on which they wagered an amount of points on    the game went on until a player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to win    but   after ratings began to fall when players were struggling to break the zero mark   the producers decided to fix the game by giving the answers to a contestant before the game began    quiz show illustrates the true stories of two particular contestants   herbie stempel and charles van doren    stempel   john turturro     a former g   i    and your jewish man raising a family    stempel has been the reigning champion on   twenty one   for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of dollars    in his mind   he is the best thing on television and the people love him    although   in the mind of the show s producers   herbie stempel is getting old    dan enright   david paymer     in particular   feels that the people are tired of seeing a   jewish guy from queens with bad teeth   and that the kids need someone better to look up to    therefore   they need to find another contestant whom would be a worthy role model and the people will look up to and cheer to win    someone who can defeat stempel   even if they have to resort to cheating    enter charles van doren   ralph fiennes     a well educated professor from a widely recognized family    van doren had decided to try out for the game show   tic tac dough   because his friends thought he would be good at that sort of thing    but when albert freedman   hank azaria     enright s assistant   spots van doren   the two decide that they have found their soon to be ruler of the   twenty one   kingdom    van doren is not too keen on the idea of receiving the answers ahead of time   so enright tells stempel that he is going to give the wrong answer   on purpose   in order to lose the game    after stempel loses the   throne   to van doren   he starts to feel cheated   which he should      meanwhile   on his own   dick goodwin   rob morrow     a harvard law graduate   has decided to start an investigation on   twenty one   to try and find out if there have been any wrongdoings    his investigation yields shocking results and leads to a trial for enright and the others involved    quiz show is an extremely well done movie   and robert redford s direction is especially superb    the performances turned in by john turturro   ralph fiennes   and rob morrow are very good   although it seems that turturro stands out more than any    quiz show is also very precise when it comes to explicating the true events that inspired the film    definitely a film you should not miss    
Pos, richard linklater s   slacker     made in 1991 for a budget of only $23   000   immerses itself in the twentysomething   college town culture of austin   texas    most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning    their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation   they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy   the pervasiveness of slave morality   the subtle messages in pop culture   and such    ask them what they ve been doing lately   and they ll more likely than not reply     oh   you know   just hanging out      linklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters   the camera follows one person for a few minutes   then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person   who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door                it s certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk   some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas   some of them are just plain weird   and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are    the opening monologue   delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver   tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film    other characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy   while groups of pseudo intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery based morality in   scooby doo      for the most part   however   the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types    near the beginning   a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks   warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars    another man seems to be collecting televisions   keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera    and in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film   a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below    the only problem with   slacker   is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end    since linklater only spends a few minutes with each character   the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while    there are only so many times you can hear     hey   what s going on         not much   what are you up to         nothing really   just hanging around     before it gets on your nerves   the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization    and the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half   a jfk buff   for example   seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist   and many of the characters just generally aren t as weird or unique    instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first   linklater shows us the oddballs first   then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too       slacker   is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy   whatever its flaws   and its status as a cult classic is well deserved    i just can t help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order    
Pos, since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller   blood simple     joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic   original   and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood    their films are highly stylized   deeply embedded in a particular time and place   and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances    in   the big lebowski     their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award winning   fargo     the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war   and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski   aka the dude    the dude is played by jeff bridges    one of hollywood s most underrated actors    in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high    the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties    he has shaggy   shoulder length hair   a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim   and he wears mostly stained tee shirts   long shorts   and gellies without socks    he smokes a lot of pot   drinks a lot of white russians   and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies   a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak   john goodman   and donny   steve buscemi     one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation   but never quite makes it in    one day   the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski   david huddleston     this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife   bunny   tara reid     owes a lot of people a lot of money    the main plot and all its accompanying side plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here    suffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money    by the time all is said and done   walter has become deeply involved   as has the big lebowski s daughter   maude   julianne moore     a feminist performance artist   a pornographer named jackie treehorn   ben gazzara     and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare   who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in   fargo         the big lebowski   plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers  earlier efforts    it shares their previous films  strong sense of time and place   as well as their send ups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies       lebowski   has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made   raising arizona   such a hoot   it has surrealistic dream sequences   one of which involves a busby berkley like dance number   that characterized the ending of   barton fink     and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded   the hudsucker proxy      the film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins   who has worked with the coens on three other films     barton fink       the hudsucker proxy     and   fargo      deakins always gives the coens  films a distinctive visual style   and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties   whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude s main competitor jesus quintana   john turturro     or the strikingly manic dream sequences   one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball s point of view    if   fargo   was the coen brothers  most restrained effort in years     the big lebowski   marks their return to over the edge filmmaking    it is overflowing with style and attitude   which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end    the coens fill the screen with lighting   set design   music   and hilarious performances from all the leads   especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman   who shows real comic timing in his untimely  nam inspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism    with joel directing   ethan producing   and both writing   the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out    their talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality   but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring them to light    the coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world   and they put them center stage to show that it s not just guys like the dude who are nuts   but the entire planet    
Neg, so much for sweet returns    after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80 s slasher movies   starting with 1996 s   scream     and followed by   scream 2       urban legend     and the original     i know what you did last summer     a film like     i still know what you did last summer     was bound to be made sooner or late    it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out   and that is because they reached for the lowest common denominator in filmmaking   favoring non stop deaths and gore for suspense   and trading in fleshed out   likable characters for one dimensional nitwits    it has been exactly one year since julie james   jennifer love hewitt   suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis   a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road   and then   thinking he was dead   dumped him into the ocean    since then   julie has relocated to boston university   and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams   she has been able to put her life back together    when julie s friend   karla   brandy     is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is   she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people   which also includes karla s horny boyfriend   tyrell   mekhi phifer     and will   matthew settle     who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend   ray   freddie prinze jr     also returning from the original     doesn t show up    when they reach the secluded island   they discover it is the last day of the open season   and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them    of course   julie   her friends   and the workers aren t the only ones there   as the murderous ben willis   dressed in fisherman garb   returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all    it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like     i still know what you did last summer     is made    i am a very big fan of horror movies   and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to   ikwydls     which i am a fan of   is almost an exact replica of a   friday the 13th   movie    while the original focused more on the story and characters   as well as genuinely suspenseful moments   thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson   who didn t return to write the sequel   and it shows       i still know          has no story to speak of   and is so vacuous of ideas   that the filmmakers   were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested    also gone are any signs of character development   and since every single character died before i got to know them   all i was left with was to stare at the screen   indifferent to what was going on    while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original   it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died    they were all paper thin and pointless   except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman    another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set pieces   like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar   but there are none to speak of in this sequel   although they do come close at one moment with brandy      since so many people were killed every couple minutes   the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water    also of note is the mystery of the second killer   and accomplice to ben   but it is obvious from the first frame who it is   and so i couldn t even have fun at that   like i did in the   scream   movies and     urban legend      it figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again   a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else    maybe the people who made     i still know what you did last summer     should have realized that in order to make a good movie   you must have a screenplay   or at least one that isn t such a black hole for thoughts and ideas    the ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part   but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel   everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead

Pos, the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80 s    more practiced as a cinematographer than a director   bava nonetheless sat in the director s chair for beyond the door ii   the project which turned out to be his last full length feature film    alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci   beyond the door ii is simply a revelation    in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker   yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970 s       note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist rip off behind the door   but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia      this story focuses on dora   a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco    the film opens with dora   her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband s suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier    they hope to put the past behind them   but as small accidents start to befall dora   usually while bruno is away on business   she starts to suspect that marco   played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr     is somehow involved in the strange goings on    to reveal any more of the story would be unfair    suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot   loads of atmosphere and solid acting   though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english    bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi   wife of famed italian horror director dario argento    her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora s troubled soul    the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective   mixing odd sounding 70 s rock with classic gothic piano sequences    and there is at least one moment   brilliantly engineered by bava   that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair    yet for italian horror   the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal    lamberto bava and francesco barbieri s script is more concerned with deeper   psychological terrors   with themes of guilt and suffering   with the notion that what we sow will shall   somewhere   somehow   eventually reap    scholars of the genre take note   beyond the door ii is stylish   chilling   and essential    
Pos, the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do    lives are often at stake   and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable   prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment s notice    the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor   psychologist   and sham artist   in addition to being a police officer   he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence   or failing that   must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower    most of all   the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible   and quickly gain control of the situation   dominate the conversation   and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants    it takes a pretty smart person to do that    but what if the hostage holding criminal is just as smart    what if he s also able to think on his feet    in fact   what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor    it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f   gary gray s the negotiator    in this film   police negotiator danny roman   samuel l   jackson   is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force    when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman s home   roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder    faced with the scorn of most of the police department   and under close scrutiny by the media   roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain s office    i don t quite remember if the captain actually said     i hate to do this   but            although it wouldn t surprise me if he did    luckily   the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above    after being offered a take it or leave it deal by the district attorney   roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum   j   t    walsh     taking him and others hostage   and proclaiming he has been framed    although roman s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build up   gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian   kevin spacey   which soon ensue    jackson   while a superb actor   is miscast in the role of roman    the actor has become so popular   and so often identified as a protagonist   notable exceptions can be found   such as in jackie brown     that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats    the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence    how can we believe he s going to shoot a hostage   no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier    unfortunately   this preconception saps the film of some of it s would be suspenseful moments   and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson s acting ability    almost every time he s in a scene   jackson steals it without looking back    when spacey appears   the film has already run about a third of its course    his is an interesting character    made out to be some kind of negotiating superman   our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation       i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower   but i can t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone     he says    when he gets the call to action   however   he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be    soon   his character has to negotiate not only with roman   but also with the swat commander   david morse   who is itching to send in a team to take roman out   all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation   should negotiations fail    this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor    as the second protagonist   spacey measures up nicely    gray really lucked out with this cast    david morse as commander beck   ron rifkin as commander frost   and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent   and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey    the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices   morse played a similar role in the rock   rifkin played the d   a    in l   a   confidential   and spencer played a police detective in cop land    with the level of acting   however   this can be forgiven    also in the supporting cast   paul giamatti as rudy   one of the hostages   is notable for the comic relief he provides    his character is initially so slimy   and giamatti himself just looks so shifty   that you expect to laugh before he even says anything    fortunately   this doesn t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film   but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout    j   t   walsh   as the suspicious internal affairs inspector   clocks in with one of his final performances    sadly   the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year   and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film    walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam   backdraft   and nixon    for one of his best performances   check out sling blade   in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton    when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march   walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success   the actors performed together in a few good men      the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh   and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role   it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing    in the end   the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it s reality    we re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best    as an audience   we re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie   and we d like to see if one will dominate the film    both provide some pretty good entertainment    
Neg, this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard    the rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend       ned  kelly   the so called robin hood of the aussies    but he fails to be convincing   in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly    the film opens to a b/w prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution    then it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback   coming home from jail after a 3 year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family    this scene is set in 1871    in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings   as he sings shel silverstein s lyrics   which tells    of ned s hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be a republic    ned says a debt must be paid        as he hears voices from his dead father   his class divided country   and his conscience   all telling him to get revenge    so begins ned s romp through australia s outback   seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered    he begins by stealing horses   after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray   which favors the rich landowners    when he s only 20 he forms a gang   causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police   who put a price on his head of two thousand pounds    when ned s mother   clarissa kaye   is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to 3 5 years   ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mother s freedom    when the authorities refuse   the kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage   burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers    rampaging through the outback   they gather sympathy among the poor and lower classes   who don t trust the traps   police      spoiler to follow in the next paragraph    in the climax   kelly and his gang plan to ambush a train with british police   but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train and kelly is trapped in a saloon and captured    ned s brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive    but kelly s gang escapes   as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers   as they become decoys    this was a flat presentation   hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly s call for justice    jagger didn t have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson    the story failed to focus on australia   seemingly a more british film than australian    under richardson s lackluster direction   all jagger seemed to do   was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge   which soon became a shrill cry    if you want to see a better film about ned kelly   catch   mad dog morgan     76     a much truer and more daring version   with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly s madness   something this film could only do in a ho hum manner    
Pos, when  star wars  came out some twenty years ago   the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image    when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars   we see constellations   meteor showers   and cool space ships    when han solo goes light speed   the stars change to bright lines   going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point    cool     october sky  offers a much simpler image  that of a single white dot   traveling horizontally across the night sky    was it really only forty years ago   when sputnik was launched   and that before then   no satellites ever existed    have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then technological achievement   even though it was from the russians    it sounds hokey   but when that scene occurs near the beginning of  october sky    i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam   played by jake gyllenhaal    determined to make a dent in the space race   he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them    it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket    when lovely teacher miss riley   played by laura dern     suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair   we know exactly who is going to win    but the joy in a film like this is in the little details    for example   homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class    if he has any strengths whatsoever   it is an undeterring vision   and a good organizer    it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school   who knows more about rocket science than he does    it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property   that is   the entire coal mining town     he must walk eight miles one way   just to set up the rockets   which will fail   fail   fail   and fail again    homer+s dad is played by chris cooper   a favorite actor of mine since  lone star     here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in  matewan    instead of organizing union rallies   he is the head of the coal miners   who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions    this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year   note how multi dimensional his character is    he is his son+s last nemesis   as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams    but he truly loves his son   and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how    through coal mining    because of his character   we can see how far we+ve come    the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us    we don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family    the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet   and he knew of no other life    so  october sky    far from being merely a feel good inspirational film   offers much food for thought    and this is the best type of inspirational film   the one that you take something with you    btw   the final image of the film is just as simple   is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal moving white dot against the night sky background    another commonplace image   to be sure   but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago    
Pos, when i left the theater after seeing david lynch s   lost highway     i remarked to a fellow movie goer     i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears      in his first feature film in five years   lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture   eraserhead   on the weirdness scale    you won t   know   what happened when it s over   though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses    it is difficult to describe the plot of this film   because it depends partly on how you interpret it    i can   however   describe what we see on the screen   l   a   jazz saxophonist fred madison   bill pullman   and his wife renee   patricia arquette     whom he clearly suspects of infidelity   receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep    they are   naturally enough   more than a little frightened and confused   and it doesn t help matters any when   mystery man     robert blake   approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons  house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving    the next morning   fred finds another videotape which   to his   and our   surprise   shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom    he is convicted of her murder and sent to death row   where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton   balthazar getty      the perplexed prison officials release dayton   whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways   most notably his affair with alice wakefield   arquette again     a blonde who is otherwise renee s spitting image   and another encounter with the mystery man    i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more   but suffice it to say that lynch doesn t offer any neat wrap   ups   nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion   the cinematic demons of   lost highway   are out in full force from beginning to end    this description might make   lost highway   sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism   but in fact   while there are traces of lynch s weird sense of humor   this film is anything but giddy most of the time    on the contrary   lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch s previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther    the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery   rather   the character * is * the mystery    there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion   distrust   and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded   fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings on here    we   the audience   are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this   probably fred s   in my opinion   and what   in that case   the other characters and events are meant to represent    all of this proceeds   appropriately   in lynch s typically slow paced   idiosyncratic style    as is often the case   lynch relies on sound   imagery   and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story   and in   lost highway   it works perfectly    there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway   or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil s   song to the siren   can be heard faintly in the background   nothing is technically   happening   in these scenes   yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as   if not more so than   the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity    lynch s direction and director of photography pete deming s darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story    well   most of the time   anyway   i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist   which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer s attention because of its tie ins to the original mystery    the main characters in this   reality     dayton   a well meaning but none too intelligent 24 year old     a sleazy gangster   who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character     and his porn star girlfriend   the blond arquette     are nothing you couldn t find in any of the two dozen   pulp fiction   wannabes   fortunately   the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements   such as the strained   awkward conversations between pete and his parents   help to preserve the film s spooky   unnerving tone during this stretch    lynch s typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality   while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery   are also somewhat overdone here    it s not exactly exploitative   like almost everything else in this film   the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills   as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off    that said   these minor flaws don t prevent   lost highway   from attaining its place as one of the darkest   most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years    it is a one way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind   and as such it is gripping   intense   and brilliantly effective    
Neg, you don t look at a ren   magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning    you likewise don t look at one for 88 minutes straight    surrealist works are notable for their quirks   and they are fun   but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting    that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died   a surrealistic   hyperactive comedy with no dialogue    it s not a silent movie   there is lots of atmospheric music   occasional screams and weird sound effects   but nobody ever utters an audible word    though the film is distinctive   its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes   and as it progressed   watching became a chore    the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo legendary ed wood   the man behind such   classics   as plan 9 >from outer space and night of the ghouls    the joke   of course   is that his films are so bad   they re good   so humorous in their inanity that they become hits    i woke up early the day i died   unfortunatly   is so bad that it s really bad    it stars billy zane   titanic   as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse   escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around   stealing a car   clothes   and a load of money    our thief reaches a cemetery   where he witnesses a bizarre ritual    he falls asleep and finds himself   literally   in a hole   with his money gone    for whatever reason   he is bent on getting his hard unearned cash back   considering how easily he stole it the first time   why didn t he just go steal some more        he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don t have what he is looking for    i don t think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short    the subject and the style seem to have been made for it    unfortunately   twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length   and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome    it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on   up to the point where halfway through i was already weary    it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious   but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is    i woke up early the day i died is a comedy   i guess   though it could have fooled me    unlike most ed wood films   this one tries to be funny and fails   instead of the other way around    there s nothing inherently wrong with that   in fact   i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so   good   at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one    whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we ll never know   but in either case   this is a failure    jonathan taylor thomas   christina ricci   summer phoenix   john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos    ricci   for example   plays a prostitute    her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out    thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff    was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work    zane   meanwhile   occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up    lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature    the carnival side show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no budget production    it s desperately unfunny   but thinks it s the funniest thing since plan 9     it s so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction    i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting send off       1999 eugene novikov &#137    
Pos,    take a number   fill out a form   and wait your turn      starring kati outinen   kari v     n   nen   sakari kuosmanen   elina salo   written & directed by aki kaurism   ki   cinematography by timo salminen  it might be possible to call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy   but that would imply a sense of anger   of vitriol   of energy   drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone    it is the sad   slow story of lauri and ilona   a married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward    he loses his job as a tram driver   because everyone drives cars nowadays    within a couple of months   she loses her position as a head waiter   when her restaurant is bought out by a chain and the entire staff replaced    a conversation early in the film reveals a lot about their situation    lauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv   which she greets with little enthusiasm    she notes that they haven t finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch yet    he says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves    it would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn t spoken with such resigned weariness    this sets the tone for the rest of the movie    there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery   but at the centre there is frustration and futility   and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people   until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity    there is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates   but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal   the movie is about two people and what happens to them   and nothing else matters    lauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship   respect   culture   passion    they go to the movies   and walk out past old posters for l atalante and l argent   but the movie they have just seen is a pointless   violent   unfunny comedy    their house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant   painted and upholstered in lifeless colours   ugly greens   dull reds   insipid blues     full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances    the art design is impeccable in its tawdriness   and director aki kaurism   ki often matches the colour of characters  clothes with the background colour and/or lighting   so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment    there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship   ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire   their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love    their downward   downsized   downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic   as one setback succeeds another   bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel    it must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs   more farce   more deadpan wit   but the film s great strength is the sober   empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona s misfortunes    irony would be an injustice    situations and settings are broad and exaggerated  this is not realism  but they are not distorted    the emotions are authentic    if it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens   despite the droll performances   the laconic humour   that s because kaurism   ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered    he shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty eight   who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position   to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two bit restaurant   how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 to confront his wife s former employer   demanding the rest of her wages   only to have the crap beaten out of him   unable to land a single punch   when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money    all this is observed keenly   with great economy   every cut   every line of dialogue   is judicious    if most films are novelistic in their telling   this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story to bear    but what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96 minute running length    i have seen many movies far less profound   less humane   less necessary than drifting clouds   but they filled me with an urge to watch them again   and this one did not    it does not need to be seen twice   its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing    it is not a movie that will be seen by a large audience   because it cannot be pitched to one    there is no selling point    it is all understatement   restraint   melancholy    the characters are unremarkable   their best years behind them   their dreams dissipated   it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills    this does not make them less fascinating   merely less marketable   which is a shame   because this is a movie which should be seen   precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore    it engages us and touches us and resolves  surprisingly   and movingly  into something resembling a happy ending    the only thing greater than the ill luck that governs the characters  lives is their refusal to give in to despair    their persistence is rewarded with what might be called a   feel good   ending elsewhere   but not here   because this ending differs in kind from most such endings   this one has truly been earned    
Neg,    there will be another     the ads for this sequel proclaimed   and why not    true   brandon lee is dead   but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994 s the crow   anyway    the idea of spinning artist james o barr s original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie   taking its own righteous vengeance against the world    given that basic framework   the story could move in any number of directions    of course   it doesn t    stubbornly   the crow   city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film   when lee s eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death    i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality    in flashback   we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover   and then we watch in real time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind    it s loud and repetitive   true   a sadist s delight    but it s also horrifying and fascinating    city of angels gives us more of the same   but less skillfully    there s an audience guaranteed for a film like this   although bad reviews and poor word of mouth will likely ensure that it won t be much of a success    in fact   miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings       i ve never understood the reasoning behind this tactic   since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow      so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup    this time   ashe   french accented actor vincent perez   is retrieved from his watery death   he and his young son were shackled together   shot   and then thrown off a pier   by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead    perez might have some screen presence if he s given something to do with himself   but here he s simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face    at first   he s shivery and frightened   but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave    he s befriended by sarah   mia kirshner     presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film    kirshner   so beguiling in exotica   is here an exquisitely photographed blank    tattooed with angels  wings   sarah is just about as lovely as women come   but she serves no purpose   not even as seductress    the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah   richard brooks     but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop   who plays a gaunt fellow named curve    iggy   all bones   veins   and drawl   is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film    like all good things here   he s dispatched too soon and without much imagination    in the meantime   we re subjected to tedious glimpses of judah s compound   where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren t distinctly secondhand    even the soundtrack is tired    more than anything i ve seen from hollywood lately   city of angels smacks baldly of product    it s a movie with a lousy script but a great look    critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope   but his work isn t that bad per se    he s got a good eye   and some intriguing visual ideas    if anything   this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery    his major stylistic failing is that he can t seem to direct an action scene   and the quick   nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie    but as director   he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn t   the performers who couldn t   and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved    who bought david s   goyer s anemic script   anyway    the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash   or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference    
Neg,  * * * warning   the following review contains spoilers * * *  cast   gary sinise   don cheadle   connie nielsen   jerry o connell   kim delaney   tim robbins   elise neal   jill teed   jody thompson   bill timoney written by   jim thomas   john thomas and graham yost directed by   brian depalma running time   115 minutes  the first big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything but    gary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from a mars mission when his astronaut wife   maggie   kim delaney     becomes ill and passes away    don cheadle is then given the mission along with a russian couple and a young hotshot    when a strange whirlwind shot from the top of a mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission   sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them   neilsen   and o connell perform a rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining    what they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever   although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected      before i ever saw the film   i was aware of the promotional campaign with dr   pepper    every time i would see a bottle of the soft drink   the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it    little did i know that the plot would be taking a back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products    dr   pepper saves the day at one point   and a dream sequence/flashback features jerry o connell shoving m&m s in our face    these are but a couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film    clich   s are also the order of the day with mission to mars    dialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style   even independence day   which lifted all of it s premises from other sci fi films was better than this film   and i don t like independence day      films like 2001   a space odyssey   the abyss   and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from   and poorly at that      there is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon   and i couldn t help but whisper   u tinni   to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it    this film also features one of my all time least favorite movie clich   s   the   he would have wanted you to have this   moment   where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having   and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on      scenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films   but in a film as clich   ridden as this   it is particularly irritating    ennio morricone s music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on   but here it is dreadfully overbearing    his music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes    at other times his music is unbearably over dramatic    one sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won t reach its intended target    mission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme    events are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience    we are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife   but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest    what makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins  character needs to turn himself into a popsicle   except to invoke an emotional response   i could think of at least one way to save him   and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be   smarter   than i am      during the finale   when we are finally introduced to the translucent   conehead   kitty faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from   we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film   just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn      a brief history lesson about   where we came from   is proffered   then sinise is whisked away to be with   the rest of our people     he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that   this is a chance to step foot where no one else has        >from the press i ve been seeing this film receive   it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater    i m sure the first weekend or two will be huge   but once word gets out people will stop going    let s just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isn t hurt by the negativity this film is generating    i d venture to say it won t be worse than this waste of time    [pg]  
Neg, a few months before the release of star wars episode 1   the phantom menace   20th century fox decides to release another space film   that is a complete rip off of star wars    what is the point of this    i do not know   but i wish it hadn t been done   considering wing commander is definitely the year s worst film so far    to attract people to this horrible movie   they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace    wing commander will draw large crowds   because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time    the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight    many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game    i found this very interesting   considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie    it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though    freddie prinze jr   stars in the film as christopher blair    wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie    this was definitely his worst performance to date    after january s she s all that   i actually saw a good actor in freddie   but now all those visions have been crushed       for now anyway      christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi   a group that is trying to destroy the earth    blair s parents also fought in the space battles   and also died there    his parents were pilgrims   so many people disrespect him because of this    blair is under the command of   angel     played by saffron burrows   and he is friends with another pilot   todd   maniac marshall     played by matthew lillard    matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie   and he does in this one too    his character as stu in 1996 s scream   a+     was a great one   but now   it seems like that same role is being played again   only in a space movie    the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth    this plot is very flimsy   and doesn t give a whole lot to work with at all    this explains why wing commander drags on   seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on    the acting is horrible in wing commander    many lines seem out of place   and are completely meaningless    the acting and dialogue was so terrible   i even found myself laughing at it    the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music    the special effects are very unrealistic    when looking at two ships flying side by side   it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them    the explosions look very unrealistic as well    a ship will be blown up   but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second    this is very unrealistic    music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time    the music also felt like video game music   and it was very corny and annoying sounding    after we are given the plot   the film repeats itself for another hour   without any plot twists   interesting scenes   or anything important to the film    blair is forced to make jumps over other planets   and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft    for the entire length of the movie   it takes place in space    it is truly like you are in a video game   because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long   extended period of time    it s not much fun to watch at all    if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships   i would go watch star wars at home    at least star wars pays attention to people   myth   feelings   and has some real plot to it    the bottom line  bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox !  
Pos, assume nothing    the phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990 s   as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be    the phrase especially goes for oscar novak   an architect who is the main focus of three to tango   a delightful   funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself    novak   matthew perry     a shy   clumsy   chicago based architect   along with openly gay partner   peter steinberg   oliver platt     fights for projects day in and day out    one of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman   dylan mcdermott     a rich   well known businessman    charles immediately takes a liking to oscar   as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor    seeing oscar as someone he could trust   charles asks him to watch his girlfriend   an unpredictable   adventurous girl named amy post   neve campbell     who makes a living by blowing glass    charles wants to know who she talks to   what she does   and where she goes    the point    to make sure she s not seeing someone else   of course    oscar gladly takes the job   and meets amy at an art show of hers   and sparks fly between the two from the get go    oscar feels he has found the one meant for him   and he is content with the idea of being with amy    well   another popular phrase of the 90 s is   all good things must come to an end     and this stays true for oscar as well    charles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night   as oscar and amy have become great friends   but he doesn t seem to mind    why is this    he thinks oscar is gay    he s not afraid to share this with him either    oscar stands in shock after the words     i swear if you weren t gay oscar   i d have to kill you     are muttered flamboyantly from charles  mouth    the word spreads instantly through town    will oscar   come out   of his supposed gayness   or will he tell everyone that he isn t    one would immediately think he would deny the fact   but numerous occurrences come to oscar   which result in the fact that if he denies the fact   he could lose his job with charles    matthew perry doesn t escape his character as chandler on the already classic t   v    comedy   friends     as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless   shy   and sensitive    nonetheless   perry is hilarious here   and shows that he can handle drama   as obviously   his character suffers quite a bit here    it s wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie     she was the star of scream 1 and 2   and the upcoming scream 3   as she handles comedy superbly here    her voice   smile   and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies  stay with this genre   neve    neve is delightful as her conflicted character   who feels love for oscar   but knows   based on rumors   that he is gay    as usual   campbell is likable as her likable character    unlike the other two leads here   dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue   and is never convincing    when his character his present   mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting    stick to the t   v    drama   the practice   dylan    the major weak spot in three to tango is the direction of damon santostefano    no originality or technique is used whatsoever    three to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy and that perry and campbell are wonderful in comedy   or else the film would have been a disaster   as it is just plain boring to look at    three to tango is a film done many times before   as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998 s the object of my affection   but the plot has never been completed so well    three to tango s script   written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun   fast   and funny   delivering not only original   hilarious gay jokes   not your run of the mill material     but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling    unlike last summer s south park   bigger   longer   and uncut and 1997 s in & out   three to tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar    the script is wise to take this route   as gays can t   i don t think so   anyway   be offended by this light   playful comedy       to prove this   a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly      three to tango s climax is a hilarious   clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romantic mistaken identity comedies    three to tango is a gem    the bottom line   three to tango is a light   sharp   snappy romantic comedy with a superb ending   and great stars    one of the better romantic comedies of 1999

a futuristic soap opera    is silly   but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans    once we get past the campy character introductions and the numerous   but never boring   training sessions     starship troopers   really kicks into high gear    its last half is all gruesomely violent action    a fury of severed limbs   decapitations   disembowelments   brain removal   explosions and other jolt inducers that are really going to please the 13  and 14 year old boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly r rated show    the creature design and special effects are amazing as expected   and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic   imaginative high point    it s nice to see intergalactic beasties that aren t too derivative of the titular menace from   alien      these monsters are appropriately terrifying sights   especially the arachnids   a spider scorpion crab combo that s all sharp talons and even sharper legs    they attack in packs of hundreds   and it s a funny   scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl   jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined   gooey mess    it matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind   ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot     these sequences of insect warfare are numerous   bloody and immensely satisfying    the occasional dramatic moments    one cast member s death   the final resolution to johnny s love triangle    are botched   a testament to how   starship troopers   fails to create any strong   outstanding characters    these bland ken and barbie archetypes serve the story adequately enough to keep any distractions at arm s length   but restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la   star wars     where even the slightest aliens had definite personality    the acting is decent   but never spectacular     most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory    smallish roles on   beverly hills 90210   and/or   melrose place      and it occasionally shows    van dien   for example   is limited but perfectly likeable    in smaller parts are the afore mentioned neil patrick harris as johnny s best friend and jake busey   gary s son   as johnny s sidekick   the latter excels at playing creeps   see   the frighteners   or   contact     but seems off kilter as a second banana       starship troopers   is based on the novel by robert heinlein   a sci fi writer who hasn t exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with 1994 s howler   the puppet masters      but the overall familiarity to the   alien   trilogy    and the promise of great gobs of gore    could act as a crowd drawer    its own possible influence   however   might well work against it when the franchise continuation   alien   resurrection   opens in a few weeks    we will know then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall    
Neg, funny how your expectations can be defeated   and not in good ways    the ghost and the darkness promised   at least   it seemed to me to promise   a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature    what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000 level material    an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters       get new jobs !    was one line   if i remember correctly    at the end of the 19th century   col   patterson   val kilmer   whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr   is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda    he is having immensely stereotypical problems   the natives are restless   his boss is a jerk   and now two man eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off    patterson tries to handle the situation himself   incompetently   and then turns to charles remington   michael douglas     a hunter of world reknown   or something like that      the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions   they should have gotten top billing and co starred with siegfried and roy    they are nigh invulnerable   as one comic book put it   and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature    give me a break    the movie hasn t got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas   it s just trying to find convenient ways to stall us    even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic    get this   remington s big plan is to build a large scaffold like structure in the middle of the savannah   sit on it   and wait for the lion to show up    he does this   and then gets knocked off by a bird    by the end of the movie   the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand    the acting is forgettable    douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow   but it s nothing he hasn t done before    kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else   somewhere else   and the rest vanish into the cinematography    the camera   by the way   sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent    what did i expect from this movie    i dunno    some real excitement   i suppose    a sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation    no such luck    i dug out my tattered copy of hemingway s   the short happy life of francis macomber   and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind    
Neg, in 1990   the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above the title stars   patrick swayze   demi moore   and whoopi goldberg    eight years later   moore and goldberg s careers aren t exactly thriving   but they have had their share of screen successes since   the same can t be said of swayze   who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog    forget the mortal kombat movies  this trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games    good truck driver jack crews   swayze   must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey    along the way   jack and his crew of three run into a number of obstacles  such as a highway weigh station   evil truckers   and deadly uzi firing motorcyclists    every so often   like at the end of a video game   level   or   stage     the main baddie pops up   red   meat loaf   fresh from the triumph of spice world     who wants to steal the cache of guns    just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of who s driving what   all of red s vehicles   be it a pickup or a big rig   are painted  you guessed it  red    i could go into more of the plot specifics   such as jack s dream of having a nice home with his family   the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license   the fbi/atf crew tracking the cargo     but they are of little importance    all that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b   but they fail at even this modest goal   for none of the highway chaos   as credibly staged as it is   is terribly interesting   let alone exciting    once you ve seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time   you ve seen it every time    as dreary as black dog is as an entertainment   the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen   it s that swayze has to reduce himself to such work    while far from the best of actors   he is certainly not horrible   and he is a charismatic presence    i don t know if it s his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog    regardless   if he continues on this career track   could a tv series be far behind    
Pos, it s rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year   but that is what disney and pixar animation   s latest film represents    while a bugs life isn t nearly as deep as it s predecessor   dreamwork s antz   it is just as funny    a bug s life centers   appropriately   around the life of an ant   named flik    flik   cutely voiced by newsradio s david foley   hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task    when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost   the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way    the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them    the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper   who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey    when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food    when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission   they never dream he will be successful   they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food    flik s mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return    instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs   who he mistakenly assumes are warriors    when he returns with the `warriors    the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes    a bug s life has animation that is simply stunning    the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative    together with the great voice acting   this film is the perfect holiday family film    its main weakness is that it couldn t beat antz to the theaters   making it seem like stale material

Neg, movies based on video games   such as street fighter or mario bros     have never generated much interest at the box office    but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995   it did surprisingly well    with a simple story   a pulsating soundtrack   and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes   the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy    it got my vote for  the movie where i expected the least and got the most     and   if you haven t had the opportunity   i would definitely recommend that you see it on video    in the world of mortal kombat   based on the popular arcade game   dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth s realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity    the mortal kombat refers to a competition   fought by human mortals against outworld s minions   which if won   will guarantee earth s safety for another generation    mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition    despite their victory   however   a gateway has somehow opened   and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth    outworld s warriors include an impressive collection of fighters   including shao kahn   mintoro   a centaur     sheeva   a four armed ogre     and sindel    earth s mortal warriors   under the leadership of the benevolent god   lord rayden   includes liu kang   princess kitana   sonya blade and jax   who must fight against outworld s forces    it s an easy enough premise   but unfortunately   very unfortunately     the writers try to do too much with the movie    it is only a video game   after all   but the on screen version tries to go beyond it s comic book boundaries by adding depth   a conceptualization of self worth   and worst of all   a love story    this becomes very awkward   because all of the players are fighters and nothing more    they are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills   but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act    this becomes embarrassingly apparent   for example   as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana    the original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best    they spoke little   but fought a lot    thus   the movie was easy to digest    however   mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth   an element that was lacking in the first movie   but the attempt here fails miserably    this uneasy feeling is readily apparent   for example   whenever you hear lord rayden speak    not only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic   e   g    useless   advice   but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom    try reading this half as fast   and you ll hear what i mean    but the movie is not a complete fatality    fight scenes are well choreographed   highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility    and players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game   although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo    even if you re not familiar with the video game   each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves    but it s just too little of what movie goers and especially fans of the game will expect    oddly   the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence    and the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival       i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom      rent the first one   but the sequel is for kombat fans only    
Neg, my first press screening of 1998 and already i ve gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list    what an auspicious beginning !  welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l   a   and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere    firestorm   the directorial debut of dances with wolves s academy award winning cinematographer dean semler   is the first of the new year s crop of movies    as our story opens   the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are   smokejumpers      we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl   where one of the gung ho guys is taking a romance quiz from   cosmopolitan      having the time of their lives   they then jump into the middle of a burning forest    when   even in the beginning   the director can t get the small parts right   you can sense the movie is in trouble    with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline filled cars   smokejumper monica   christianne hirt   tells them to get away from their soon to explode vehicles    not bothering to shout nor even get close to them   she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people    miraculously   they manage to hear her and move away    in a movie that specializes in cheap shots   the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building    as it does throughout   overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f   windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl s face    our show s two heroes   the crew s chief   wynt perkins   played laconically by scott glenn   and his second in command   jesse graves   played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal   enter the burning house looking for the little girl    in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames    the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse    this mawkish show cuts back to monica   who has a life or death decision to make    the chopper with the fire retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group    will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica s two firefighting buddies    she has only seconds to decide who will be saved    yes   she goes for the majority   but   miracle of miracles   the other three come out alive anyway    not content with a traditional firefighting story   chris soth s screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape         hoods in the woods     is what the   ground pounders   yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire      along the way   shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis   who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father   who was a marine drill instructor    most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing    he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck    arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside    using a ramp   he shoots straight out of the top of the building s attic   and when he hits the ground   he just rides off in a cloud of dust    when the film isn t using some stock footage of actual forest fires   the simulated ones look hokey    editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions    the ending   with its sick twists   manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie    perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby     it s not as bad as some of the television sitcoms      firestorm runs mercifully just 1   29    it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers    
Neg, my inner flag was at half mast last year when nick at nite pulled   dragnet   reruns off the air    sure   i d seen them all at least once   but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv    even though   dragnet   is out of circulation at the moment   we webb anti fans still have the d   i     a 50 s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous   blue boy   episode of   dragnet      for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb s rapid fire speeches and straight faced seriousness   think of the d   i    as what would happen if sgt    joe friday ever enlisted   because he plays exactly the same character here   a no nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long  winded   melodramatic speeches on any topic    in this election year   i m more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth    the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb s office door and enters    he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up    the   produced and directed by jack webb   card pretty much goes without saying    this is his movie all the way   and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason   i was wondering if there would even be a plot    i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants   but the d   i    gives us more    much more    webb s mission is to make a man out of private owens   the local screw up    the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or   the captain will   personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself         whether the   lace panties   part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered      this   of course   gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens  life a living hell    for those of you who haven t been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching   here s a reprint of a typical monologue of his    i can t duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper   but the words should at least partially convey what i m talking about           now you listen to me   youngster    someday you ll wake up fighting on a beach and you ll pray to god somebody doesn t get killed because of your foolishness        i ve got a headline for you   every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours   you re gonna turn around and i ll be standing right there      i couldn t write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d   i       nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame     but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines   like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day s work by going to the local bar   where he orders a tomato juice      he meets a woman who   coincidentally   also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch rival   another marine d   i    webb marches over to the table   gets up in her face and says     just what kind of a dame do you think you are      bogart he ain t    the other d   i    gets one of the few memorable non webb lines when he confesses to the girl     he s a damn good d   i            i guess i m just a little jealous      join the club   we re all jealous of jack webb s way with women   which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene   as webb finds his way to the woman s place of employment   a lingerie store   and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display       you expect me to talk to you        in  here    !   he exclaims   no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras    the woman goes off to help a customer   leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen    a little girl spots him in the store and demands     what are you doing in here       you re a man   aren t you      he doesn t reply   but you know he s thinking in his head     what an odd species of human    so small    must be one of those children everyone s been talking about      this poor girl   scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb   would later swear off the male gender entirely   just one of the many lesbian conversions he s responsible for    the movie doesn t focus too closely on webb s romance   it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie   where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills    after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea   webb asks owens     was that flea you killed a male or female      owens replies     a male   sir      webb yells to the platoon     this ain t the one !    that such a scene   along with the rest of the movie   was intended to be taken seriously defies comment    but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d   i     but for iwo jima   guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century    webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie   with the exception of owens   were played by actual marines    someone wanting to parody this movie couldn t do a more comical job than webb did    it makes it all the more ironic   like raeeyain on your wedding day   that the man had no sense of humor himself    there s a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter    webb bursts in the room and shouts     what did i tell you about laughing   !    to which the private replies     sir   only nine year old girls laugh   sir !    and let me tell you   i was as happy as a nine year  old girl while watching this movie    
Pos, stendhal s syndrome   a condition where   in the presence of art   a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression   suicidal behaviour and personality disorder    grim stuff   to be sure   but the subject of a remarkable film from italy s master of the horror thriller dario argento    boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone   the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento    it follows his disappointing american debut trauma   1992     the patchy opera   1987   and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980 s    based on the novel by graziella magherini   the film stars argento s daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist killer    visiting florence to follow up several leads   she is lured by the killer alfredo   thomas kretschmann   to an art gallery   a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail    at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints    posing as a bystander   alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer   a strange game of cat and mouse begins    a gripping story evolves   and a coherent one   too   which may surprise those familiar with argento s often lumpy narratives    the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop hunting killer scenario    it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character s psychological disintegration    the script explores its psycho sexual themes with intelligence and candour   perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers    but as dark as its themes are   the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years    argento is once again working in his native italy   and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences    effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here   and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent    the film s opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination   flashback and real time with tremendous style    proof that   at his most inspired   argento remains one of the world s most exhilarating filmmakers    the cast is generally good   though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless    asia argento s performance is by turns risky   awkward and fascinating    it s a difficult role   and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts    thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo   and marco leonardi   of cinema paradiso   and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy   does okay as anna s work colleague and increasingly confused love interest    but perhaps the stendhal syndrome s single most striking element is ennio morricone s soundtrack    active since the 1960 s   morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts    it s mostly a variation on the one theme   a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary   haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards    it s been three decades since argento and morricone worked together    this is a long welcome reunion    if the film has a fault   it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn t quite reach a completely satisfying climax    but by the closing scenes   the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento s career     * note   see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can    dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web

Neg, the tagline for this film is     some houses are just born bad      so i didn t expect too much from this    but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre    i thought   liam neeson   cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont    i thought   mabe it will be fun    and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing    but by the end of it i thought   why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones   jan de bont      these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality    here is the story   in the monstrously over decorated mansion known as hill house   visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor   liam neeson   into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation    among them is a sophisticated bisexual   cathrine zeta jones     a cynical dope   owen wilson   and a gentle and emotional lady   lily taylor      actually   the doctor is researching the   primordial fear reaction   and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens    but he gets unexpected help from the house itself    it rumbles   hums and belches forth remarkable sights    portals become veiny stained glass eyeballs    a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth    filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains    but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real   placing an emotional wall between audience and screen    the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture    is that exciting or what    the worst thing about it is that it didn t have to be bad    it s based on a great book   ``the haunting of hill house      by shirley jackson    a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent    it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience       the blair witch project     that cost less than an old car   managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses    and with a $70 mill    budget   de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror    de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is   in itself   frightening    he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush    but why give him a more serious material    in the end   haunting   will only haunt its fledgling studio   dream works skg   and de bont s career as a director    yet it wouldn t be fair to say that everything is bad    the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated    beautiful   mysterious   magical and spooky    but this is where the good things end    the music is blaring   the floors moving   the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming    and all of this   every second   every moment of screen time   is absolutely without life    it s nothing more than a special effects extravaganza   visually impressive   but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn t engage    at first you do not know what s going on    is this part of the experiment    are these hallucinations    projections of the subconscience    paranoia    but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening    the house is actually possessed    it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window    for ever   i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that s what i got    i believe hichock once said that   it s better to wait for a climax   than to see one      this may be true   and it might actually work   but there is only one problem    jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary   only stupid    they are impossible to take seriously    any paralells that you might have heard before   linking this picture to kubrick s   the shining     are absolutely baseless       shining   had class   style   story   acting   but most of all talent and originality       haunting   has only special effects and art direction to boast of    and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film    casting good actors for small   pale parts only makes things worse    but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write   most of you will see this film anyway   even if the tagline would say     some films are just born stupid      
Pos, the thirteenth floor   the third in what i would call   the reality check movie series     is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year   the matrix and existenz    all three made you think   made you wonder what is real   what isn t   and if our world is just a huge game    the thirteenth floor doesn t reach the level of originality   creativity   and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz   but it certainly gives a great shot at it    in the matrix   we were told that the humans are simply a virus    in existenz   we learned that our life could be just a game    in the thirteenth floor   we learn that we are just electronic devices   living under another world of electronic devices    there is just one world on top of another   and everything in them are fake and electronically generated    the thirteenth floor took a huge   risky turn that i didn t expect it to take   and i m not very sure it was such a great turn to make    rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film   the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds    after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller   played by armin mueller stahl   douglas hall   played by craig bierko   a man that worked under fuller for many years   must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using   to the year 1937   which consists of computer generated characters only    the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days    all of the people involved are just characters   or are they    douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours   and killed fuller    along the way   douglas interacts with many different potential suspects   and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller   jane fuller   played wonderfully by a talented young actress   gretchen mol    the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going   and doesn t use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer s interests    i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz   and i wouldn t enjoy it   but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film    unfortunately   many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content   letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened    the scenes that aren t original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere   leaving you wondering     what is the point of this      sometimes it was hard to believe that this story   with terrible dialogue   some bad acting   especially from craig bierko   and scenes that go absolutely nowhere   are actually true    i know this isn t a true story or anything   but a film should be able to make you think that it is    on the plus side of acting   we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor   armin mueller stahl    in the thirteenth floor   he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances    another plus is gretchen mol s realistic performance   creating her character with depth   not just staying in the one dimensional phase    don t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor   just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile   and shuts you down like any other movie would    thrills   chills   and spills aren t what you will get in this film   but you will just get another trip to send your mind on   scrambling it until you ve had enough    the bottom line  let s hope this is the last of the   reality check   based movies for awhile    
Pos, the ultimate match up between good and evil     the untouchables   is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry    based on the 1959 television show of the same title     the untouchables   may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place   but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences   some excellent acting   a memorable score   and a clever script    the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public    elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order    however   as ness soon learns   in order to stabilize peace   you have to bend a few laws    the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes    the film begins with capone   played perfectly by deniro   declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws    the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl    from this point we know capone is evil   not only because he kills without hesitation   but also because he is a lying bastard    right from the first five minutes of the film   de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs    this developed hatred is before the film s hero   ness   is even introduced    i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone    the film only gets better from this point    with the formation of the untouchables   there is a group of men wearing long   dark overcoats and hats    they walk in unison and they only look forward    as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens    holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals   this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films    one that comes to mind is   the matrix   when neo   morpheus   trinity   and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world    wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930 s style   the similarities between these two are countless       the untouchables   has some of the hippest   bravest heroes in any action film    the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone s army    each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others    elliot ness   played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner   is a character that surely grows during the course of the film    he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be    however   as the film develops so does ness    his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side    he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends    his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in    sean connery   who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role   plays malone   an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables    malone acts as a mentor to ness    he teaches him   the chicago way   to do things   when they attack with a knife   you attack with a gun    connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed    andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone   a young man who is just becoming a police officer    as ness grows   he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him    charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone    smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film    the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen    also very similar to   the matrix     they are exciting and intense    >from a western like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps   the scenes are well thought out and well executed    the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement    its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors    the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective    although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified   this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting   great directing   and great action    some scenes   capone and the baseball bat   the train station   have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid    
Neg, there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been    the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944   where a one time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets   fists stuffed into coat pockets    to one side of him   residents scavenge for food in the street   to the other side   german troops beat a group of jews    jakob   however   never stops moving    it s an efficient   effective set up for the character   who is clearly nobody s idea of a hero at the outset    he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them   excising his moral peripheral vision    the set up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior    after a visit to a german commandant s office and a moment alone with a turned on radio   jakob learns that russian troops are quite near    when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews   they become convinced that he must have a radio   which is a punishable offense in the ghetto    the good news brings hope to the ghetto   the everyday specter of suicide vanishes    a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive    this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting   the   ordinary person   in question   jakob heym   is played by robin williams    i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his   serious   roles with every passing year    compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams   and see how much more mannered he has become   or   at the very least   how much less sensible at choosing material      jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions   but williams always looks like he s struggling  not  to craft them    when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10 year old orphan lina   hannah taylor gordon     he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky    oh yes   and then there s that little girl    some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero s fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful   but those scenes aren t problematic because they re familiar    they re problematic because they re jarring and distracting   introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn t have been about cutesy relationships    jakob s character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others   but there are plenty of others without poor little lina    every scene with her feels contrived   pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people    it is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood ized holocaust   combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways    director peter kassovitz   working from jurek becker s novel   crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople   and draws solid performances from armin mueller stahl   as a once revered doctor   and bob balaban   as a barber drifting into depression      there are just too many things going on that prove distracting   whether it s the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter   or williams  incongrous presence   or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl    jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling   and has too compelling a central character to waste    and after one wonderful early scene   you can see the film wasted and fumbled away    
Pos, this remake of   la cage aux folles   features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son s future in laws    the couple   robin williams and nathan lane   are about as archetypal   or as the less kind might put it   stereotypical   gays possible    williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star    they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode    williams is excellent as should be no surprise    gene hackman as right wing potential father in law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles    the real star is lane    his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight shooting uncle is hilarious    perhaps it is a personal failing on my part   but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it    luckily   for me at least     it doesn t last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men   their son and the deception    the question of stereotypes is a touchy one    these guys personify the homophobic gay image    you can almost hear the swishing    if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world   you ll be outraged    but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals   you ll love it    your choice    
Pos, whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films   the end result is always a mess of a script   acting   directing   and generally a waste of time for any audience with an average iq above 40    the latest movie morass from hollywood   the crew   appeared equally destined to fail   a strange combination of grumpy old men and goodfellas tossed together with the likes of richard dreyfuss and burt reynolds helming the ship    the scary thing is that it s actually entertaining and a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month    the crew works for several reasons    the clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie   following four   past their prime   wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach    the wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their   golden paradise   by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property    the four mobsters   bobby bartellemeo   richard dreyfuss     joey   bats   pistella   burt reynolds     mike   the brick   donatelli   dan hedaya     and tony   mouth   donato   seymour cassel   decide to hatch a scheme to plant there a dead body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and keep their home    this   simple plan   suddenly goes screwy   of course   and the boys become involved with a stripper named ferris   jennifer tilly   who wants her stepmother killed   a paranoid latin drug lord who s convinced a mysterious rival is out to get him   and a rat with its tail on fire    the crew works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men    instead of concentrating on bobby s search for his daughter   the film gives equal screen time to all four wiseguys   balancing the production    the acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya   seymour cassel   and the great   great burt reynolds are brought out by each character s uniqueness and synergy within the wiseguy circle    a strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as a philandering boyfriend/cop/partner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs    the film was produced by barry sonnenfeld and carries a hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner   emmy award winning director of the wonder years    the quick script written by barry fanaro   screenwriter of kingpin   is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and wit    the crew is a prime example of how simple and dry witted a comedy can get these days    the great thing is that this comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids   phallus symbols in the head   or grandmothers giving head in a spa    in the steady flow of   extreme   comedy these days flowing from hollywood like a broken water main   it s the elder statesmen like dreyfuss   reynolds   and hedaya that can carry a comic arc with only a few weapons of choice   a decent script and good acting

Neg,    showgirls   is the first big budget   big studio film to receive an nc 17 rating    and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence    but if   showgirls   is any indication of hollywood s future   the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values  bad moviemaking       showgirls   is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene   and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter    director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas   who collaborated on another shock value project   1992 s   basic instinct     follow the plight of a young woman   teen tv star elizabeth berkley   determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer    it s a hackneyed premise to begin with   so not surprisingly   all of the stock characters are trucked out    there s the demanding producer    the loyal friend    the bitchy competitor    lest i forget the scummy club owner    of course   any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film s main attraction  an endless parade of full frontal nudity    unfortunately     showgirls   doesn t satisfy in this department    verhoeven s slam bang   in your face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic    to make matters worse   you ll be forced to sit through the movie s clothed scenes   which don t cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history    verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground   but if it s adult entertainment you want   stay home and watch the playboy channel    you ll be the wiser for it

allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered    if there s one thing i can t stand when i see a film   it s when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty    films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this   and now ice from the sun can be added to this list    this film is essentially an 80 minute stalk and slash film   following the dante s inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6   intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and   supposedly   haunting images   many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot    if there aren t bizarre images floating past the screen   then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone    compelling   but ultimately not    the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images    the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesn t pop up until near the end of the sequence    when the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv    at least the music in the film is pretty decent   made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett    at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them   and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing      for some reason though   he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance    one over alled cretin handles the presence s gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel   then there s an inbred father   dwight spurgin   and his two inbred children   mark kettler and jennifer poirrier wallace   that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half dog half human mix with a shotgun   and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds    why would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of   rednecks   when you yourself had all of these cool powers    and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time    i can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment    the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence    the character in question   dana   angela zimmely     has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated    a priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken    he picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken   taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever    when she starts to leave   the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life   walks out   and makes like it wants to be crucified by her    the presence starts to clap annoyingly   which continues for the rest of the sequence   until dana takes off with the strange creature following her    when it finally catches up to her   she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ    the box for the film claims   because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture   parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18    contains nudity and graphic violence      while both is certainly true   there doesn t seem to be much of either in any large amounts    besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump   a semi graphic self surgery scene   and two instances of head trauma   one run over and one melting     most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety    as for nudity   it is very sparse   but at least we get to see angela zimmerly   far and away the most attractive cast member   before her body is bruised   torn   and bloodied by the dragging incident    ice from the sun has been released on vhs by www   b movie   com    it has been presented in in full frame only and the transfer   for a film shot a good deal in 8mm   is pretty decent    besides the decent soundtrack   which is also available from www   b movie   com     a making of video is also available called on thin ice    i haven t had the opportunity to see the documentary   but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed   if only to see how director eric stanze   director of a similar cult film called savage harvest     conducted the atmosphere on set    
Neg,  bicentennial man  is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment    chris columbus   the director who gave you   mrs   doubtfire     plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point    based on the short story by isaac asimov   it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human   which as you can imagine is very difficult    starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children    soon this robot   called andrew   robin williams   shows abilities that makes his owner mr   martin   sam neill   very curious    andrew is interested in art and music   he   enjoys   making clocks   which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions    it shows out that because of a small failure in the   electrical circuits   and   positronic brain   andrew has accidentally gained a soul    this makes him unique and his evil creators worried    then mr   martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn t programmed to do    soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom   destiny and love    this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner   a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction    ever since that film   the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy    what makes us human    the thoughts    the emotions    is it possible to become human    at what point can we say to a robot   now you are one of us      these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach    it is obvious that columbus didn t take them very seriously    when you think about it   this film is not really meditating on the question   when is a robot no longer a machine   but a human being       but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding    andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being   and only the society has troubles with it    in other words   it is as far from reality as from the academy awards    further more   there are other annoying problems    to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now    this has not been done for obvious reasons   because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task    columbus is the first to have crossed that line    the result is   as you might imagine   primitive   unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort    the world is simply frozen in time    neither the society   fashion   culture or values have changed over 200 years    mom is still working at the kitchen   doing the dishes    when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today   you ll see a slightly bigger difference    i am not saying that everything should change    it is unlikely that the human rights will change   but it s even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science   technology and fashion    i suppose it s possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale   but it s really hard    robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way    as always he does a decent job   as does sam neill    but it doesn t really matter    it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience    pretty much like last year s   meet joe black     this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesn t deserve    great actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten    when isaac asimov wrote this story   the future seemed far away and magical    everything seemed possible    now is the future of asimov s time   and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago    for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne s   20 000 leagues under the sea     so can t we accept this story as a potential reality    let us hope that next year s   a   i      will be more rewarding    
Pos, after having heard so many critics describe   return to me   as an old fashioned hollywood romance   i kept asking myself going into this movie   what exactly is an old fashioned hollywood romance    what made   return to me   old fashioned and old hollywood    was it the tunes from sinatra   etc     legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on    was it the glamorous   sophisticated feel    the charisma of the two leads    even now i can t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer   because i haven t see that many old fashioned hollywood romances    i don t think any of the romances i ve seen have been classified as such    which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics      return to me   was old fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic   the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider    it was traditional   magical    we knew it couldn t be too daring   or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in    it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity   tenderness   and love   from director bonnie hunt   that it couldn t help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings    the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt s direction    from the very first bird s eye view of chicago   zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland   david duchovny     accompanied by the   return to me   ballad   by whom       we can tell we re in for something sweet    the scenes between the characters are endearing   truthful   with just a hint of fantasy    real people don t act that way   real people aren t that nice    we know all this   and yet we want to believe in these folks  existence    the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale   but hunt s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal    everything is ordinary  yet beautiful  in this film    >from the festive little family restaurant to grace   minnie driver   and bob s wardrobes    from the eloquent   not in a hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints    from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen    the most beautiful part       return to me   has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family   the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist    we care for them   laugh with them   cry with them   we re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father    whatever hunt did   she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors    disappointingly   david alan grier s charlie   however much i like him   was the most flatly written    duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona    with the help of his fellow co stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder    instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of   the x files      duchovny   who is excellent at understatement and self deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen    minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet   innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer    though an unlikely pair   duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses    while   return to me   functions remarkably as a laugh out loud comedy   a romantic scenic tour through chicago   and a tearjerker   the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop    the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife s heart    we already know that there s going to be a happy ending   we feel like we spend the entire film   however enjoyably   in a straight line going towards that point    as a result bob and grace click almost too quickly  yes   i know she s supposed to have his ex wife s heart and everything  it seems too effortless    the main subject is a love story   and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters   whose story might not have that much meat after all      however   in the spirit of   return to me     it won t do to be too picky about how   old   hollywood tells its stories    i loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt    it shows    the bottom line     return to me   is nothing remarkable   and yet its sweetness   sincerity   and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn t imagined    
Pos, contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan s only novel    it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway   jodie foster      we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico   where she is part of the seti   search for extraterrestrial intelligence   project    her research is quickly killed   however   by her highly political david drumlin   tom skerrit     who disdains   pure research   in favor of science with   commercial applications    she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s   r    hadden   john hurt      then   with that money just about to finally dry up   ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal    in the movie s most exciting and believable sequence   ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega    at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers   then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before    further decoding   with hadden s help   reveals another layer to message   containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine    it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens  home world    of course   the big question becomes   who gets to ride it         right after   who s gonna pay for this thing          to boil it down   ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism   while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith    drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform   apparently to keep   godless science   from talking to god   or something like that      then hadden reappears with startling news    he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie   in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest    ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels   where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father   david morse      when she returns home   no one believes her    she was not even gone for one second   they say   even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours    her story is officially discredited   although believed by a large segment of the public   who don t even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static            eighteen hours worth of static      there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first    ellie arroway is a well rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working    neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs   but that s a tough standard to meet    ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures    her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally    drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble    hadden obviously has affection for ellie   but in the end he seems to see her as his creation   nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board    even palmer joss   matthew mcconaughey     ellie s love interest   takes a paternalistic interest in ellie   seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses    the film is technically impressive   especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine    the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain    the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme   the dichotomy between science and religion    this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved    the film presents science pretty well   until the end   so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith    religious people are presented as shallow caricatures    rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank   very subtle   guys     the voice of the religious right    another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine   jake busey      the only really fleshed out religious person   palmer joss   is supposed to be a minister of some sort   but his actual faith is left pretty vague    i can t even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian    all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre marital sex    the film drops the science ball at the very end   when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith    in a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist   religious   doctrine   this is exactly the wrong message to send    in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith   the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism    what ellie should have said was     you shouldn t believe me    not without evidence   and i don t have the evidence    i know what happened but you shouldn t take my word alone      that is the voice of science speaking    the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film    his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position    also   his profession of   faith   before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it    the last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles    the media figures   such as bernard shaw and jay leno aren t so bad   in as much as their participation was voluntary    the use of bill clinton   however   should give anyone pause    first of all   lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line   thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken   is just plain creepy    also   using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001   forever dating it    people watching this film in the future will say     hey   this never took place during clinton s term      this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief    also   the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century    better to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all    the film does raise an interesting question   although it never develops it in a satisfying way    if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture   would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god   or at least some form of supernatural creator    personally   i would hope not   since religion is basically an opinion   a form of ideology    i would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task    
Neg, die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco   inferior to the original in every respect    place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson   who wrote the film s pathetic screenplay    every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor    the plot is altogether implausible   the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower   leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land    the film has zero credibility   and all of the characters come off as cliched   cardboard cut outs    so much for the script    how about the action    well   let s put it this way   director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan   who directed the original   as well as the hunt for red october and predator  all standouts for their hair raising suspense    by contrast   harlin doesn t have a clue when it comes to choreographing action   and consequently   die hard 2 never picks up steam    die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute    in fact   the movie often seems deliberately campy   and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it s good    you do laugh   but you laugh at the film   not with it    die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff    
Neg, i have a confession    even though i am a movie junkie i saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch movies i ve never seen any of the original godzillas       note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u   s   godzilla released in 1998   it s the american release of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni sen mireniamu      so   part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000 the latest entry in an almost 50 year old franchise    this was a long awaited treat    i was expecting a goofy good time   complete with bad dubbing   science fair level sets and a ludicrous plot line    the last thing i expected was for the movie to be so   boring    i can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt    you do get all of the   so bad they re good   traits so normally associated with the franchise    but you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot    it s a deal i wasn t willing to accept    hiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimura s script crams in way too many details   and in many cases   fails to follow up on them    the maneuver is not only disconcerting   but gives the movie a permanent logy   weighty feel    godzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops    was it a whim    a bold political statement    i don t know    its foe   an ancient meteor that looks like prudential s logo   doesn t just fight the beast from the far east    no   it s got to have life saving powers   a plot to erase   the data   from japan   a desire to clone and the ability to become a spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature    there s a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit   takehiro murata   and a slimy government official   hiroshi abe   over the handling of godzilla   and personal issues    and then there s the plucky news photographer and blah   blah   blah    it s like watching magnolia all over again except without the good writing   keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs    what a waste    when the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you   godzilla 2000 does the job it s entertaining and goes down easy    the action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though a little sluggish    the dubbing is nice and awful   with murata sounding like he s in constant need of a cough drop    as for the dialogue   one line summarizes the goofiness factor     did anyone see that flying rock go by      this movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that i ve heard the word   imbecile   used in casual conversation    though the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla 2000 has its moments   i wouldn t take kids to see it    they ll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose    
Neg, i m not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream   but i m guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft    seriously   this idea  a psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends  is a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off    the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue    an example     that [car crash] must ve been awful       for  everyone involved      you can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said   just no one figured out what    i know in slasher movies there isn t supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself don t mind cardboard cutouts   but please don t let the cutouts be so damn bland    one reason movies like scream   star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters    aside from jared leto and joshua jackson   who aren t on the screen long enough   no one in urban legend makes the grade    alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill   rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive   not to mention as dumb as a post through 3/4 of the film   and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot    good thing brad dourif is here   but wait       he s only in the movie for five minutes  and  he s just redoing his good natured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoo s nest    which brings me to another aspect of urban legend   it s unoriginality    the film most blatantly ripped off is scream   another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven s and williamson s great success      urban legend tries to deconstruct modern day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films   but it doesn t quite succeed    it s best stab at self reflexivity is poking fun at   that girl in the noxzeema ad     ie   rebecca gayheart   we also have another killer taunting his victim on the phone routine in urban legend and quick   what movie is this exchange of dialogue from    female protagonist   why    villain   why    why   !    congratulations to those of you who answered scream and/or urban legend    like i said   this movie could ve been great    if only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script    still   at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer    
Pos, metro i ve seen san francisco in movies many times    there was 1994 s interview with the vampire and most recently the rock    now   yet again   san francisco is the setting for this movie    eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper of the sfpd   he is their top hostage negotiator   and the very best at what he does    when his best friend on the force is killed by joe   michael wincott   in a terrific performance     a psychotic   demented jewel thief   roger makes it his mission to capture the guy before he strikes again    meanwhile   roper tries to rekindle a relationship with his british ex girlfriend veronica   while helping to rear a new up and comer from swat who s an expert sniper and marksman   michael rappaport      despite the obligatory cop movie scenes   does every cop/new partner movie have to start the same way      where the sgt    assigns roper a partner   roper confronts the sarge   etc     this film is still one heck of an explosive ride    a scene involving a cable car has to be seen to be believed   and boasts some amazing car stunts    eddie murphy shines in this tailor made role   and for once   his character shows depth and concern    when confronting joe in prison   you can feel the anger drip from every word    michael rappaport is basically throwaway    he serves no purpose   except to be buddy to murphy and get disabled in the final reel so that eddie can save the day    typical action escapist fare    michael wincott offers the best performance as the crazed killer and jewel thief joe    never before have i seen such a villian written like this where i could actually believe that he was serious and take him seriously    maybe i just thought that this role was different due to wincott s perfectly raspy voice    i don t know    what i do know   though   is that although metro is basically a typical action retread   it manages to cover new ground and shed new light on tired old cliches     the film is a triumph   and an entertaining one at that    it doesn t meander or trail off from its main character    an enjoyable two hours   metro is enjoyable   witty   action packed   and fun   and makes for a great action movie that s perfect for all of us that need an escape from reality    
Pos, moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post salary cap era    you ve got to know how to allocate your resources    every dollar spent on a free agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers    in the nfl   this leads to teams like the detroit lions   who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract   but can only field five guys named herb to block for him    in the movies   you end up with films like   spawn     with a huge special effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors    jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking    he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line    watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid   fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars   is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit   except that sanders doesn t have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages    but like the lions star   jackie doesn t have anybody to block for him    almost every cent that s invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts   and as chan does his own stunts   the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills    this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors   chan directs     scripts and dubbing and supporting characters   not to mention the hideous title sequence    this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain       chan s first release in this country     rumble in the bronx     was supposedly set in new york   but was filmed in vancouver   and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible      heck   jackie doesn t even have enough money for a haircut   looks like   much less a personal hairstylist    in condor   chan plays the same character he s always played   himself   a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen   a master of both kung fu and slapstick fu    jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert   and is chased by a horde of neo nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs   one of the things i like about jackie chan movies   no political correctness      he is joined by three women   who have little to do except scream     jackie   save us !     and misuse firearms    the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere   and he s more pathetic than evil    en route   we have an extended motorcycle chase scene   a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo nazis   and two confrontations with savage natives    once at the secret desert base   there is a long chop socky sequence   followed by the film s centerpiece   a wind tunnel fight that s even better than the one in face/off    this is where the money was spent   on well choreographed kung fu sequences   on giant kevlar hamster balls   on smashed up crates of bananas   and on scorpions    ignore the gaping holes in the plot   how   exactly   if the villain s legs were broken   did he escape from the secret nazi base   and why didn t he take the key with him        don t worry about the production values   or what   exactly   the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara    just go see the movie    operation condor has pretentions of being a   raiders of the lost ark   knockoff   but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him    with a lawrence kazdan screenplay   a john williams score   spielberg directing and george lucas producing   condor might be an a+ movie    however   you ve got to go with what you ve got   and what you ve got in jackie chan is something special    a talent that mainstream hollywood should   could   and ought to utilize    
Pos, note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    james toback s return to directing after a eight year layoff   two girls and a guy   is a film which is comprised   more or less   of just that   one guy   blake   robert downey jr       two girls   carla   heather graham   and lou   natasha gregson wagner     one primary setting   blake s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment     and a great deal of dialogue    embracing a near real time approach   this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr   toback for his bantering characters    fortunately   the film s cast is up to the challenge   and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters   while admittedly variable   are occasionally wickedly amusing    the film s setup is fairly generic in nature   and opens rather unpromisingly    we meet self possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou   both waiting outside a soho loft    as they engage in idle chatter   it is revealed that they re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport   and it doesn t take long for them to come to the realisation that they re being two timed by the same guy    more indignant with him than catty with each other   the duo break into blake s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation    it s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride    played with magnificent bombast by mr   downey jr     blake is a cad   all right   but a captivatingly dynamic   blusterous   and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights    it s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat   and perhaps the film s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return   allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others   but by his own innate behaviour    whether he s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi   or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds   carla   lou   and his unseen sickly mother     it s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful    though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one man show    a typical afternoon in the life of blake   if you will    carla   and then lou   reveal themselves   and the sparks begin to fly       one of the great touches in the film is how blake   when startled by carla s unannounced appearance   begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat s out of the bag      double teamed by the understandably aggrieved women   who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful    they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy     an increasingly flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self righteous declarations against their verbal jabs    surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters   two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off limits for this film    however   it d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou s outrage to full feature length   and it s as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel    the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever   the film s tempo loses its liveliness   the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion   and several sequences fall flat    subtle and not quite subtle allusions are made   a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall     and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale    one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla    two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter   long running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene    contractually obligated to deliver an r rated film   mr   toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc 17 rating in favour of an r    and while admittedly titillating   the net effect of the vignette on the film s thematic narrative is rather dubious    if anything   two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr   downey jr     whose versatility is put to the test in this film    he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled   from self assured to disconcerted   yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered    it s a wonderful performance in a role custom tailored for him   mr   toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr   downey jr   was arrested on drug charges   and it s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character    in a monologue to his mirrored reflection   blake s self chiding to   get [his] shit together   is disquieting in its resonance    while mr   downey jr    s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film   both actresses are solid in more broadly observed roles    ms   graham is quickly becoming one of america s more daring actresses   involving herself in three successive risky projects    two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank   while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman    she s quite appealing here   playing a character at once both dainty and sultry    meanwhile   ms   gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying   or   like me   endearing    she tones it down substantially as the film progresses   but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox    the film was reportedly shot in eleven days   filmed mostly in sequence   and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout    two girls and a guy has an agile   spontaneous sort of feel   and one senses that mr   toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors    while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact   it doesn t feel constricted   the expansive apartment setting is well used to vary the background   and mr   toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner    two girls and a guy falls short of its potential   but thanks to some stellar work by mr   downey jr     it s still often an enjoyable   bitingly funny romp   particularly as we watch the surprisingly resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends       i m an actor     he tells them at one point   using the ol  tried and tested occupational hazard defense       actors lie      but not   they all seem to agree   denzel washington    
Pos, one of the best movies i ve ever seen    i d heard extremely good things about this movie   and though the previews didn t really intrigue that much   it was a movie i d been anticipating for a few months now    for some reason i m not sure of   this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u   s   it was a definite hit with the critics   but didn t exactly set any box office records    after viewing this incredibly well directed   written and acted movie   i can t help but wonder   why    the strength of this film is it s gritty realism    the main characters are all human with individual flaws   no stereo type hollywood heroes    you may not agree with many of their actions in the movie or their approach to life   but that is what makes it so real    i had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a thriller   but i was mistaken    even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase    and the ending             whoa    i ve never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly    the three male leads   guy pearce   kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific    the  best actor  oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue   but there is one problem there    how could they have chosen between these three actors    there is no way i could look at this film and say one of them was better than the other two    it s impossible    kim bassinger s performance is also a revelation    i d never been a big fan of hers before and always thought she was   well       what s the word   a twinky    that impression has changed   as she complemented crowe and pearce perfectly    the depth to the story and characters is truly astounding    no cardboard characters here    the plot is full of twists and turns and some very clever sequences    pearce s interogation of three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant    i really can t fault this movie at all    i was so glad to see fellow australian s pearce and crowe star in such a breathtaking movie    i had been very familiar with russell crowe beforehand from his many australian films   but had not seen much of guy pearce    i intend to change this next time i visit the video store      
Neg, remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage       pulp fiction   and   fargo   both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture   and not surprisingly   a slew of rip offs followed in the years thereafter    that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing   the way of the gun   that at first glance looks like another of those wanna be s but upon closer inspection doesn t look like anything comprehendable    it s a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere   a film that won t allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous    complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who s familiar with mcquarrie   he wrote   the usual suspects     which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim    that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate   confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings    you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that   if it s really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating      with   the way of the gun   mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea   but this time the story is far less commercial   a shame because maybe that would have helped    the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren t hell bent on death either   played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro      they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization    they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother   played by juliette lewis   and get a nice ransom    along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec   his wife   their hired goons and the   bag man     played by james caan   the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he s doing      the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can t call the authorities for help    his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers  trail and each make different offers to get the mother back    the exec s son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right    meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double crosses   secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all    mcquarrie doesn t know the meaning of the word simple    he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie    everything has to be complicated and confusing   so much so that it s to the point of surrealism    nothing is what it seems in this reality   it s one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry s rules and regulations    every scene with caan s character exemplifies this perfectly   the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him   getting into conversations about   the business   and how it works and we re hardly given a clue as to what they re talking about    these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they re more like ideas ripped off from sketches found in david mamet s trash    no one here really acts like a real person   and the story is even further removed from reality    it s like a dream without any appeal    take the opening scene for example   the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff    they sit on a brand new mercedes and the car alarm goes off   the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don t move    the guy and his loud mouth   potty mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them    you d think phillipe   and del toro are   going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don t   instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob    there s a lot of things i didn t understand about this scene   first of all the owner of the mercedes isn t some yuppie or old rich snob   he s like a hippie straight out of the 60s    secondly   the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed    lastly   it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country s army    if they were suicidal they wouldn t have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place   and where they get all those guns is never explained either      there s a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility    what it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems   which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is    absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable    and it s all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time    with any film you see   whether you like it or not   you can at least understand what the appeal was to it   why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it    i can t say either for   the way of the gun     because it has very little going for it and i can t imagine anyone intelligently defending it    
Pos, sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to    it s not the time or the distance   it s the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy    yet somehow   the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story    the wings of the dove fits the pattern    kate   helena bonham carter   and merton   linus roache   are in love    merton   a newspaper writer   would like to marry kate    but kate s   job     if you will   is to be a member of the british upper class    her father lost all of her family s money   but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man    naturally   a newspaper writer s wages don t count as   rich      kate leads him on   but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder   ultimately because he s not marriageable    kate s american friend millie   alison elliot   stops in for a visit on her way to venice    at a party   millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees    kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie   he might forget about her    it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup    merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it    he is still in love with kate   and will accept no substitute    the three of them   along with a fourth friend   elizabeth mcgovern   end up on holiday in venice together   where their interactions are quite complicated    let s sum up   millie has fallen for merton    merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate    kate loves him but can t marry him   so on the one hand she s trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy   but on the other hand she s jealous of them as a couple    a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick   dying   in fact    at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies    millie will leave her money to merton   who will then be rich enough to marry kate    she lets merton know of her schemes and   since it will help him win kate   he reluctantly agrees    kate leaves venice so that the two m s can be alone together    merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her    he s not sure he can separate the two    kate finds that she s not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else    the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved    without revealing the details   suffice it to say that the situation ends badly    the title refers to the object of merton s vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament    one is left with feelings of regret and despair    what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed   anger   and jealousy    an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over   and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir    a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after    their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other   and after a few things go wrong   the whole idea seems like an awful life ruining mistake    i wouldn t call the wings of the dove a film noir   but the comparison is interesting    as i have acknowledged before   i am not a wonderful judge of acting   but i liked the performances from roache and elliot    roache successfully conveyed his character s ambivalence toward millie   near the end   he hugs her   at first staring into space   as if he s thinking about his plan with kate   then giving that up to fully embrace millie    millie s part didn t require as much range   but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible    i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion    their settings are far removed from my personal experience   geographically   historically   and socially    still   the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over    
Pos, star wars   episode i   the phantom menace review  a review by jamey hughton stars    starring liam neeson   ewan mcgregor   natalie portman and jake lloyd director george lucas rated g  with all the hype that star wars   episode 1  the phantom menace has been receiving   it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film    the movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever   with a marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders   the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together    can george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago   in a galaxy far   far away            yes   this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch   with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity    but that doesn t mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment    the phantom menace features the most eye catching   jaw dropping visual look in cinematic history    the tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest   and the special effects are nothing short of the best   and most plentiful   to ever be caught on film    the vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding    the phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses   even if it has some disappointing aspects    after we re treated to the famous prologue in the sky   with john williams  thundering score   we meet qui gon jonn   liam neeson   and young obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor     a jedi master and his trainee `padawan     they are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation   and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo    oh   but enough about that    the prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker   jake lloyd   into the picture    as you already know   this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader    a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter    this particular race is the most exciting   energetic   high octane action sequence that you ll ever see    one of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has devised   and the phantom menace is no exception    i loved sebulba   the rat like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race   and boss nass   the leader of the gungans   who are a neighbouring species to naboo      one character who has been subject to criticism is jar jar binks   a member of the gungan race    jar jar speaks like roger rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug   and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief    yes   he is initially annoying   but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless   goofy antics    there is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry   but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses    the final light saber battle   between the jedi s and the horrific   and terminally underused   villain darth maul   is spectacular to behold    jabba the hutt   yoda   c 3po and r2 d2 have cameo appearances    lucas has not forget how to captivate an audience   even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness    one can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments   episode s i and ii    when they arrive   you ll know where to find me    
Pos, synopsis   in phantom menace the galaxy is divided into power groups whose interests will inevitably collide in later sequels    there is an overarching galactic united nations type organization called the senate presided by a weak chancellor    within the senate two camps are at odds   a bickering   isolationist alliance called the republic and their aggressive rival the trade federation    preserving law and order are a council of jedi knights who are meanwhile searching for a prophesied chosen one of virgin birth    manipulating events behind the scenes is a dangerous   reemerging clan called the dark lords of sith   so shadowy and secretive that they comprise a   phantom   menace    jedi knight qui gon jinn   liam neeson   and his apprentice obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor   witness an invasion of teenage queen amidala s home planet naboo and befriend a gungan named jar jar   ahmed best      on the desert planet of tatooine the two jedi   jar jar   and amidala   natalie portman   attend a lengthy drag race involving the young boy anakin skywalker   jake lloyd      the five protagonists try to solicit help for freeing naboo by visiting the city planet of coruscant where a lot of debate and political maneuvering takes place    can they free amidala s helpless planet    opinion   on tv last night i watched young   wannabe celebs pay $400 a ticket and come running out of theaters to bask in front of news cameras   gushing with testimonials of the phantom menace s greatness in exchange for a few seconds of being on national television    given this kind of media mania i wondered if phantom menace   the most anticipated movie of 1999   could possibly live up to the extraordinary hype that preceded it    does phantom menace match the exaggerated hype    director george lucas answers     it s only a movie      to me   any movie with russian sounding accents for bad guys   jamaican accents for good guys   and middle eastern sounding accents for seedy gamblers accents can be expected to be more tongue in cheek than profound    visually   star wars   episode i   the phantom menace   1999   is a kid show where parents can take their young ones to marvel at child friendly cgi characters and wondrous backdrops even if the character dialogue   mostly geopolitics   is beyond the level of children    it is left to parents to patiently explain the conversation   droid origins   family lineage   the definitions of terms like blockade   appeasement   federation   alliance   symbiosis   satellite controlled robots et cetera    at least this much is clear   there s plenty of eye candy   and in the last few minutes it s good guys and joe camel lookalikes versus a caped   horned red devil character and his mechanical hordes    weaknesses   weaknesses lie in the writing and in the performance    at first it seems like the film is to be an invasion story   but then phantom takes an hour long detour to cover one chariot race before returning to the invasion theme    this dilutes the central story    additionally   smaller scenes seem written self consciously   as if they were added more to fill us in on extraneous background information for other movies rather than form an integral part of the present movie    veteran actors liam neeson and ewan mcgregor noticeably outperform the other acting leads    better ensemble chemistry between the five leads and background information that is central to a tight story line could have made have given phantom stronger performances and storytelling punch    strengths   on the bright side phantom menace as a big budget production is far ahead of the competition in terms of making whimsical creatures   worlds and vehicles appear real    the film boasts sophisticated   top of the line visuals and quality exotic costumes   a musical score entertaining enough to stand alone   and three worthwhile sequences in the second half    bottom line    seeing the film is entertaining and informative   like a visual theme park with star wars filler information serving as dialogue between impressive money shots    we are bound to be completely inundated by star wars publicity   music and tie ins for the next few months    
Neg, the word to describe sharon stone is   wonder      not that she  is  a wonder   but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent    she has a dynamic screen presence in   basic instinct     turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in   casino     but possesses neither of those here    stone teams up with private school headmaster s wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani s thoroughly unlikable husband   chazz palminteri      in a comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock   as in `homage to  [read   steal from   ]     it turns out that someone saw them or he s not dead or maybe        kathy bates turns in a credible   if unspectacular   performance as an investigative police detective    her character is a bit dull but realistic   although her actions at the end are puzzling    adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation    it s stone that is a disappointment among the actors    how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one    costumed in skin tight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone   she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring   not enticingly dangerous    even the threat   or promise     of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out    on the positive side   there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive    that is if you can put up with stone s cardboard cut out character and scenes directly lifted from hitch s movies    
Pos, when i saw the trailer for   the sixth sense     i didn t expect much from it    my snap judgment was that it was a watered down version of   the shining   or possibly a late entry in the glut of angel related movies/tv shows of a couple years ago    but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot    it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year    bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe    at the beginning of the movie   he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work   but he is soon confronted by vincent   a patient malcolm failed years earlier   donnie wahlberg former new kid in an impressive cameo      a year passes   and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed    cole sear   haley joel osment   is a withdrawn kid who is called   freak   by the other boys in the neighborhood    weird things seem to happen around cole his mother   olivia williams   leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn t moved and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn t for example   that there was once a gallows in his school    he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom    the trailer gave away the movie s first major plot twist    if it hadn t   the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn t know what s wrong with cole    if you re lucky enough to have not seen the trailer   stop reading this review right now and go see   the sixth sense      anyway   since the trailer gave it away   i figure it s fair game to discuss here    once malcolm gains cole s trust   cole reveals his secret   he sees ghosts everywhere    dead people wander around not knowing that they re dead   invisible to everyone except cole    malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth    the box office success of   the sixth sense   has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that s so    i hate to burst anybody s bubble   but   the sixth sense   isn t really a horror film    at its core     the sixth sense   is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally scarred adult help each other to move past their problems    some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy   though    one that really got to me   the ghost of a boy says to cole     i ll show you where my dad keeps his gun     when the ghost turns   we see the bullet wound in the back of his head    osment gives the best performance i ve ever seen from a child actor    it s hard enough to find a grown up in hollywood who can give a subtle   realistic portrayal !  although willis gets top billing   cole is really the protagonist of the story   and osment truly brings the complex kid to life    if only willis  work were as impressive    accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue   willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm   his most challenging role to date       this is a bad omen for his next movie     the story of us     which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage      writer/director m   night shyamalan has a light   poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite    he s also a skillful storyteller   as the movie s ending demonstrates    only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie    look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole    bottom line   osment should get an oscar nomination   and you should go see this movie    
Neg, while i am not fond of any writer s use of cheap   easy puns   i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it   witness my review of  pecker  from a couple of issues ago      so here goes   the juvenile   college set black comedy  dead man on campus  is dead on arrival    strait laced med student josh   tom everett scott   who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout    s blemish free academic record breaks out into fs   thanks to the influence of his ever partying roommate   cooper   mark paul gosselaar     who introduces josh to the sex  and booze filled nights that come with university life    with the threat of losing an academic scholarship   josh   and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming   cooper     what are two good hearted slackers to do    easy  look for a loophole   which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student s   or students    roommate commits suicide   the surviving student   s   shall receive straight as    so instead of studying   josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there   move him into their dorm room   and drive him to suicide before the semester ends    director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white   working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder   take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper s diabolical plot    until then   the usual boring cliches of college life   booze   sex   more booze   fill the time   which is made to feel longer by  saved by the bell  alumnus gosselaar s sitcom bred mugging    that said   once cohn and company do build some comic momentum   they mishandle it    the introduction of the manic   psychotic cliff   lochlyn munro     a potential roommate for josh and cooper   brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates   paranoid nerd buckley   randy pearlstein   and british death rocker matt   corey page      one wishes that cliff would reappear   but   as they say   be careful what you wish for    not surprisingly   he does resurface   and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose   almost immediately   his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty    the same can be said about all of  dead man on campus     whatever morbid appeal the far fetched premise has quickly evaporates   and the self absorbed characters   especially cooper   pretty much grate from the get go     dead man  doesn t grow tiresome   it already  is  once the clever opening titles are through    as it slogs along to a cheesy   happy for all parties conclusion    dead man  lives up to its title and then some  not only does the movie grow even more tired and die   it still insists on going on        like a zombie    
Pos, who would have thought    jim carrey does drama    when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show   i thought     what a hilarious idea for a movie !    however   it was an even better premise for a drama    the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man    that man is truman burbank   jim carrey      truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly   cristof wants to keep it that way    christof is the   god   of this made up world    he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles    there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world   but they failed and life went on as normal    the opening parts of the film introduce to truman s world    we see what he is doing at his current age   then we get a flashback at his past    it may seem a tad boring   but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start    the film can be described in one word   weird    it seems like such a simple idea   yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of   but andrew niccol did    it seems like a warped idea   but it is andrew s idea and he did wonders with it    jim carrey actually lived up to the hype    the hype   whether good or bad   always focused on carrey s ability to do drama    no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be   the only thing they doubted was carrey    and he showed them all up    jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars    i do not think he was the best actor   but he deserved the nomination    he plays truman burbank   the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world    he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years   but then strange things start happening    he ventures into the wrong elevator    a light crashes in front of him    his father comes back and is then pulled away    we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show   but truman does not    and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish    carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama    laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife    she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point    peter weir does not make the cast perfect   and their flaws eventually lead to truman s escape    the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down    despite carrey s greatness   the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris   who plays the   god   of truman s world    he displays the pressure he is under   the world he has created    he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life    the action moves at a good pace   and rarely gets sluggish    but   the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show    it really makes you think    maybe your brother is an actor   maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show    some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking    or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman s arrival    and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon   noah emmerich   delivers his dramatic line    all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative    i was not only enjoying the film   i was overwhelmed by genius of it    overall   the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood    jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces   but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best    andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection    the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film    
Neg,    the 13th warrior   comes at the end of as summer where we ve already experienced man eating sharks     deep blue sea       man eating crocodiles     lake placid     and even a man hunting witch     the blair witch project        now     the 13th warrior   presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears    the story   if that s what you want to call it   follows ahmed ibn fahdlan   antonio banderas   an arabian poet who falls in love with his king s wife and is banished from his home land    he then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them    eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men    thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission   and as you guessed it   ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth    he s not a warrior   and at first not well accepted by the vikings   but as the movie advances he ll have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield    that s basically the entire plot    there is also a romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and   one assumes   drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didn t just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story    instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer    the film is basically non  stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock    the battle scenes   although well choreographed   are not involving and not the least bit exciting    we don t get to know any of the characters and so we don t care who lives and who dies    the film   which wants to be beowolf   comes across more as a failed action adventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels    it was directed by john mctiernan who s     the thomas crown affair   is also playing in theaters currently    and it s not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that     the 13th warrior   was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences    it belongs back on the shelf    
Neg, everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap   from the roger corman grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign   the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi   the undiscovered country      but piller s not quite half baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection s failure    i m about to give the same advice to rick berman and co    as i ve given to the financiers of james bond movies   it s time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and a real director       while we re at it   put that visor back on laforge !    for three hundred years   the ba ku species   who look just like humans   have lived on a ringed planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth    six hundred of them occupy the briar patch   the area affected by metaphasic radition   a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly    but evil ru afo   this is probably abraham s last stop before performing   amadeus   at a dinner theatre near you     leader of the son a   who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery     wants to relocate the ba ku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place   in order to replenish his dying breed    the federation is all for this   but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive   to not interfere with the development of an alien race       never mind that the ba ku didn t exactly evolve they went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world      every time frakes gives an interview lately   he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment    he has called it a comedy   a thinking man s picture   a throwback to the old series   and   most grievously   he has likened it to a john ford western       i presume that s some john ford he went to school with   not the director of the searchers      he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version    that s no excuse someone generated this footage    muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems   star trek   insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia    consider such curiosities        picard s love interest   anij   donna murphy     can slow things down by staring at them   such as a waterfall or falling rocks    her scientific explanation for this       don t ask      worf gets a pimple   he s re experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the time defying atmosphere     laforge regains his eyesight   trust me   levar burton s real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact   and troi brags about her firm boobs   but picard remains as bald as an android s butt    most suspiciously   what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun    the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about a family feud of sorts   and they also turn ru afo into a completely power mad superfreak   just so the characters will have something to do in the climax       and if you ve seen return of the jedi   you ve seen the ending of this movie      didn t picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions    frakes lucked out with first contact   and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection   he has no sense of comic timing   and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists       take a look at the painful   troi gets drunk   scene in fc and you ll get the general idea of insurrection s unsuccessfully jokey and hollow tone      even the worst shatner and co    treks   like the final frontier   maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless   charming comaraderie between kirk   spock   and bones    neither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher   gates mcfadden   whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique     troi   or laforge    and all three next generation films spend too much time on data   who is the franchise s answer to urkel    need a cheap laugh    have data say something sexual   or start singing   or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it s the hunk of styrofoam it really is    here s my proposed title for number 10   data star data trek   data data data data data    in this movie   data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose   while crusher and troi watch silently from 500 yards away and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation    star trek   insurrection had one nice   eerie   silent moment that hints at a better   darker film    i m not saying all of them should be star trek ii   the wrath of khan   but this one boldly went where no movie should go again

Pos, here is a film that is so unexpected   so scary   and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop    okay   it isn t quite original   considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species   but it certainly is smart    most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b horror films from the 50s and 60s   and some even become them    however   as we learned with the 1995 small budget horror/sci fi film   sometimes expectations can be shattered    a lot of criticism has gone against this film   from what i have read so far   anyway  yep   all two reviews     and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory   laughable pieces of trash    but   the thing is   it isn t    it s well made   well acted   and quite intelligent    i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film    but the species series isn t about the lack of these elements    it s about how much it can get into one film    and yet   behind it all   it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so    species ii begins in the present day   though it seems to be an alternate universe    many films   especially sci fi ones   create similar timelines as our realistic one   but change it to fit the film s needs    species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft   the excursion   landing on the surface of mars    aboard is patrick ross   justin lazard     a very bright and very handsome astronaut    patrick is the son of senator ross   james cromwell     who just wants patrick to succeed    well   it would seem that he has succeeded    landing on the surface of mars   he is the first human being to ever do so    of course   he isn t the first ever    about a billion years ago   an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life    now   of course   the red planet is cold and rocky    no life lives on it    that is   no visible life    patrick   upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil   collects samples from the ground    he takes them aboard   and puts them in storage    unfortunately   one of the samples contains a form of life   and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship    just prior to heading back to earth   this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings    they pass out for approximately seven minutes   and then shrug it off as nothing   because they can t even remember    they blame it on a technical malfunction    back on earth   patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible    as we know from the original   this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet    however   the children that are bred are half human   as their father is    patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with   and he finds it in eve   natasha henstridge      eve was cloned from dna taken from sil   the original alien    however   this time around   most of her   alien   urges have been either decreased dramatically   or lie dormant    the project is led by dr   laura baker   marg helgenberger   reprising her role from species     and her motives seem respectable    since she was involved with the original alien attack   she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again    and it has    story wise   species ii is much stronger than its predecessor   but it is also much stronger than   say   aliens   hey   i love the film   but you can t tell me it was strong on story      what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay    in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college   we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles    this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars   later   it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it      the script uses this effectively   but also manages to provide a well balanced plot    beginning with the first man on mars   something i have always dreamed of seeing     i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie    and it does it quite well    the characters are all smart   and they know what to do and what not to do    the only character that seems a little cliched is the general   george dzundza     and yet   he remains logical in everything he does    there are the obvious flaws of course   mostly lying in the technical aspects    the special effects are only mediocre   and some are just plain bad    but for the most part   they remain believable   i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children      also   the most realistic ones are usually the goriest   ranging from people being torn open   or someone s head being blown off    however   some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience   including a menage a troi that is all but necessary    many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex   nudity   and gory violence    however   i tend to disagree    what were the alien films about    and   if an alien species ever did come to earth   and their sole purpose was to destroy us   wouldn t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible    my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store    i didn t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with   i just assume it is his part human side looking for the most beautiful one      the acting is quite good for this kind of film    it is a vast improvement over the first film   at least    the acting is the key element to this film   if it was bad   it would have lowered itself into camp   if it was good   it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens    okay   so it isn t that good    george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting   as his over the top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting    natasha henstridge is limited this time around   as she is usually enclosed in a cage    however   she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent    oh yeah   and she s quite fun to just plain watch    marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around   and her performance is probably the best in this film    michael madsen is so so   but he isn t annoying   and he soon becomes rather appealing   with his nice cynic personality      james cromwell has a small part   but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor    as i say   any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability    mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance   and he gives the film a more down to earth feel    and   of course   justin lazard    lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance   but i think he is effective    sure   he is wooden   but isn t that what his character is like    the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done   due to the couple s acting    species ii is rated r for strong sexuality   sci fi violence/gore and language    this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see    more than likely   they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives    hell   i don t even know if i will    what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year    i probably won t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while    director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful   and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series    medak has also mastered the wonderful   jump !    moments   and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film   scream still has the first      strong acting   smart dialogue   intelligent plotting   and a sure handed director   species ii is exactly what these films should be   entertaining    
Neg, i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago    i guess my memory really sucks    there is very   very little that is funny in caddyshack    the laughs are few   and far between   and what there are really aren t that great    caddyshack   as the name implies   more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club    michael o keefe plays said caddy    why they cast this unknown   fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me    the movie doesn t seem to have a real plot   just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera    the only real story   if you can call it that   was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper   bill murray   who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course    most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera    with painfully limited success    bill murray is slightly amusing in places   but fairly wasted    the biggest waste of all is chevy chase   who didn t even crack a smile on my face with his character s lame zen like approach to golfing    there are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight   but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie    i guess that s what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid    i m not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of   but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper    nothing about this movie works    it wouldn t have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasn t going to fly    most of the scenes just couldn t possibly be funny    it s as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world    i m sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny    in reality   they were painfully embarrassing to watch    there is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the   hot babe   of the movie walking by in her bikini    olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl    everything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned    maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny    but for the rest of us   stay the hell away from caddyshack    
Pos, in   magic town     jimmy stewart is in peak form playing a pollster who heads to a   perfect   town to gauge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only poll takers care about    however   as time progresses   and he finds himself falling in love with the town   and a woman     he begins to see that what he s doing is wrong    the plot is standard stuff   but that s not important    in a film like this   it s the calibre of the actors that make or break it    obviously   since stewart stars   that s practically a non issue    he s great in the film   as usual    there s just something about him that always manages to be endearing   even when he s deceiving the town folk    you re always on his side   and you desperately want to see all of his goals come to fruitition    the film was directed by a longtime frank capra script writer   and it shows    this is the type of feel good picture that capra is famous for    by the time   the end   shows up on screen   everything has been wrapped up very nicely    there are no loose ends   and virtually every character gets a happy ending   those that deserve one   anyway      in this age of cynicism   it s refreshing to see a movie so upbeat       magic town   is a delightfully entertaining motion picture    if you believe all old movies are slow paced   you d be well advised to check this one out    
Neg, it s always a bad sign when the core audience of a film    children    are either walking out early or are half asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film    that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians   a cold pea soup of cute animals   stupid home alone antics   a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans   and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression    indeed   walt disney is rolling over in his grave again   cursing john hughes  name for making the original live action 101 dalmatians   one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time   and now its sequel    the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor   101 dalmatians    the original made more than $100 million dollars at the box office   spawned a torrid collection of   collectible   items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal marts across the country   and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas    well   it s been about four years since then   and dalmatian fever is coming back   and this time it s digitally enhanced    here s the story    cruella de vil   glenn close   is released from prison due to the   cure   of her puppy homicide urges by one dr   pavlov       oh   how witty      she rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer   who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film    cruella then becomes ella    dog lover    until the plot twists   like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck   and she becomes the evil vixen again    a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat   but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula    at this point   i was envying those kids filing out of the theater    how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu   as the film s villain   sunk in the film business    it s almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon    and depardieu        how can a french guy have a bad french accent    and never mind the toilet brush haircut    the only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent   courtesy of eric idle   that thinks he s a rottweiler    now that s funny    
Pos, martin scorsese s kundun   which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama   has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure    personally   i don t think it needs one   it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china    scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do   as a larger than life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership   the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences   but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal    the set design and cinematography are outstanding   and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle   it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao    political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans   kundun does not   it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative    
Pos, some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled   making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen    i finished mike figgis    leaving las vegas   hours ago   and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr    alot of people refer to this film as   that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude         leaving las vegas   is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are   a drunk and a whore    ben   nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years   is the drunk    his family and friends have long since abandon him   and all he has left is his liquor    in a scene early in the film   we see ben staggering into a resteraunt   looking for a   friend   of his to mooch some money off of    he finds the guy   richard lewis   having dinner with a buddy and two chicks   trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid    when ben approaches the table   you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable    after lewis gives ben the money   he coldly says   i think it would be best if you didn t contact me again      now even though through the course of the film   some much more depressing things happen   this is when i felt the most for ben    there was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face     not to sound hokey or anything   it almost brought a tear to my eye    it turns out that ben was once a semi successful hollywood player   and apparently a pretty popular guy    now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women   not so much for the sex   but for the company   for someone to talk to or spend time with    once he is fired from his job   ben decides to burn all his belongings   collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death    one night he runs into a prostitute   a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue   how far she has come since   adventures in babysitting     named sera    she is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp   a scumbag who gets off by cutting her    they are both very lonely   self destructive people    they immediatly hit it off   both of them realizing that they need one another    and it isn t even a sexual relationship    they don t even have sex until   like   the last ten minutes of the film       leaving las vegas   is not a film about plot    with the exception of what i have already revealed   which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so   by the way     there isn t too much of a story to it    it is more a film about people and how they react to one another    from what i can see   this is basically a perfect film    the direction is great   with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody   smokey atmosphere of a film noir   and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the 90s   or any other decade for that matter    but don t go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what you re getting yourself into    first off   if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge   stay away from   leaving las vegas      it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms   rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon   that s right      secondly   if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film   don t see it    however   if you are cool with those two things   you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have    
Neg, the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie   if you don t count neil simon s biloxi blues      year after year   more predictably cliched military movies come out    most recently sgt    bilko    and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last    i thought stripes would be different    with ivan reitman as director   bill murray as star and harold ramis as co star and co screenwriter   it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army    instead   it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army    murray   about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs   plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success   and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him    so he does   and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell   head shaving and marching/singing sequences   more mind numbingly stale here than ever    the characters are even less original   ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette    all the big name stars in stripes   and even larroquette   fall victim to the lame   rehashed material and are never really likeable   murray in particular    he only gets a few decent lines in   although those barely funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters    he was even better in caddyshack   for crying out loud    as with a lot of the late 70 s / early 80 s comedies   stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex  obsessed no child should be able to watch it    i m sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women   but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition   dear god !    every few seconds    stripes isn t the playful kind of sex comedy   either    most of the time it seems downright misogynistic   as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women s showers or murray lifts a female m   p    onto the stove and   with an i know what you like look on his face   says he s going to give her the   aunt jemima treatment     which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly    you don t want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region       i m not enjoying this     the woman protests    my sentiments exactly    
Neg, the first in a very long list of things wrong with   i still know what you did last summer   is the title    think about it for a second    if the last movie was called   i know what you did last summer     wouldn t the next movie have to be   i still know what you did two summers ago      if anyone working on this movie had an i   q    greater than five would have thought about it logically and said     hey        wait a minute      but alas   the people behind this film are obviously idiots   so i won t hold them to that    what i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands   even for a teenage slasher flick    i guess i m one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film   emphasis on the   kind of        it wasn t great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good   but at least it didn t have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it s sequel did    there are just so many problems with this movie that it s hard trying to figure out where to start    first of all   i guess   is the setting    the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas   other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting    exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james   jennifer love hewitt   one of the only survivors of the first film   and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up    the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through    in one scene   julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can t get out   no matter how hard she tries    when julie discovers she s going to slowly fry to death   she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue    now   this is all fine and dandy except for one thing   instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth   why not just turn the freakin  thing off    in another scene   one of the characters   after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker   says to julie     just don t tell anybody it rained the whole time      oh yeah   i ve just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered   but hey   i ll crack jokes anyway    after all   it is in the script    the film s only saving graces are a few well executed suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the   re animator himself   jeffrey combs    he brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie    way to go   jeffrey    i have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept it s head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson    with   scream   and even it s sequel   he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter    his ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers   and i think   i still know   has really suffered by not having him on board    the cool atmosphere is still there this time around   but i just didn t like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one    even though the movie doesn t have williamson   it still has a hacky ending   trying to do what kevin did with the first two   scream   s by   some may consider this a spoiler   but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever   then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes   having two killers and   this time   having one of them being a family member to the other    i think someone in the audience put it best when   after the movie had ended with another   the killer is back !    cliffhanger   he said   who is this time   the grandma      all in all     i still know   tries to be as successful as the first the film was   but really fails in the attempt    i mean   it s okay when slasher movies rip off each other   but when they start copying themselves        
Neg, the happy bastard s quick movie review  damn that y2k bug    it s got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother   william this time   in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on    little do they know the power within        going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there   virus still feels very empty   like a movie going for all flash and no substance    we don t know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere   we don t know the origin of what took over the ship   just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir     and   of course   we don t know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout    here   it s just   hey   let s chase these people around with some robots      the acting is below average   even from the likes of curtis    you re more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20    sutherland is wasted and baldwin   well   he s acting like a baldwin   of course    the real star here are stan winston s robot design   some schnazzy cgi   and the occasional good gore shot   like picking into someone s brain    so   if robots and body parts really turn you on   here s your movie    otherwise   it s pretty much a sunken ship of a movie    
Neg, the happy bastard s quick movie review  holy man  more like holy crap    the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs   jeff goldblum and kelly preston   with a flat tire on their hands    somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel   a line up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white   morgan fairchild   and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures    it s here that he seems to hit his stride   speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales    at this point in the movie   of course   morality comes into play   particularly on goldblum   who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss   robert loggia      it doesn t take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush   with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points    only a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild s face seems to have any interest in the movie    murphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he d rather be someplace else    some may argue that the movie has a message   but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat    at least he has something for us to laught at        
Neg, there have been bad films in recent years    mr    magoo  was by far the worst ever made   the spectacularly bad  blue in the face    the horrible  baby genuises  and now  i woke up early the day i died     it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie    the film s acting   if that s what you want to call it   is well mediocre to me    loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit   boy was i wrong    after escaping from a mental institution  the thief  played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty    he turns to burglary to survive   robs a loan back   kills the loan officer and runs with thousands    a country wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down    he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later   comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere    now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back   ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying    a film which was based on a  long lost  script by ed wood   i have only one question   no dialogue   only music and movement where exactly is the point    the film moves along at a rather slow pace   but does have one advantage   the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some    it opens with a fun   innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that    some of the low points are when  the thief  steals a woman s purse   and then she faints   sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom  the thief  kills to the music of  psycho     come on people get some new ideas already !  what s even worse is that the film has no plot at all    well to a certain extent it does   but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we re bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen     i woke up early the day i died  is a perfectly bad film    it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie    even with the huge cast talent   the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours

Neg, a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets    the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities    the result is merely an academic exercise   leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn t build on to show them as the poets they were    on paper   this shouldn t have been so terrible    it had a talented director in agnieszka holland     the secret garden       a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton   dangerous liaisons     and a capable cast    but the film was done in by its inept script   the unappealing way the film was directed   and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud    i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film   with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius   spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade    he   especially   looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be    but when the two of them were together   it looked like a mismatch    leonardo s rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude   yet we know from rimbaud s poetry   that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring    the film opens in post revolutionary france in 1871   the 16 year old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems    he accepts verlaine s praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home   and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville    once there   rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household   has an immediate conflict with verlaine s busty 18 year old wife mathilde   romane     and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family s money   even though he has nothing else in common with her    when verlaine states     poets can learn from one another     rimbaud replies in a haughty tone     only if they re bad poets      he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship    verlaine proves to be weak willed   beating his wife regularly   and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud    when mathilde s father kicks rimbaud out of the house   verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers    it s a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets   which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce    in brussels   verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail    while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19    he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun runner   and after ten years there   comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37    the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying    the film ends on a whimper       with  verlaine talking with rimbaud s sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses   which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published    this film was especially annoying because rimbaud s poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film   as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry    i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film   but whatever it was   it just didn t work    it certainly didn t bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so called father of modern poetry    
Neg, apparantly money talks            and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so !  i ve always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess   whether in language   violence   sex   or what have you    i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard   and money talks definitely does !  it s not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly   and i mean constantly !     but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged    perhaps if one character were foul mouthed   but in this film   everybody swears nearly every other word    money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett   played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker      franklin is your typical con man and ends up with more than one person out to get him    when the plot finally gets underway   there s no less than three people   or groups   that want him   dead or alive    the frenchman who s somewhat responsible for franklin s escape from a prisoner packed bus   a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand   and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder    franklin s only hope   james russell   charlie sheen     an investigative reporter for the local news who s out to prove himself a worthy journalist    james offers to help clear franklin s name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week    both of these elements are completely lost along the way however   and never do reappear    as expected   the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end   which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way    there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film   and so many developments are either non relevant   or just plain forgotten about    money talks is a paint by numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience    frivilous dialogue   a predictable   flat storyline   and two dimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your money

Neg, capsule   silly and inane adaptation of gibson s short story   which is nowhere in sight    gibson s script only adds insult to injury    johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie    i say   awesomely   because it s one thing to fail   but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged    keanur reeves   who is terrible   stars as johnny   an   information courier   who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head    he is given   one last job     whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words   run     which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal    one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories   but it s only followed up on in a token fashion    for his trouble   johnny gets chased by the yakuza   who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high tech thrillers    what s funny is that if you watch gangster movies made * in * japan   there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics   but of course there s no room in this movie for any of that    the yakuza are simply used to point guns   wave swords   flaunt tattoos   and grimace menacingly       i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies    bound by honor   sugar hill and american me come to mind    when asians remain perpetually stereotyped    but that s another essay      anyway   johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark    why newark    maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york   that s why    there   he meets an assortment of odd characters   ice t   dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos      the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture    it turns out   what else     that the data in johnny s head could save a lot of people   but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn t kill him    handled right   this could have been absorbing   but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity    the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other   better movies    blade runner and brazil come to mind    everything looks run down and scummy   everyone dresses like they re punk rockers   and videophones are commonplace    snore    the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future   complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves     but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively un technical fellow would * think * it would look and behave like    a hacker of johnny s caliber would be blasting away with one command line function after another   instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms   but of course that s not cinematic    whatever    what went wrong with this movie    gibson wrote his own screenplay   which i guess is part of the problem   what works as a short story doesn t work in a movie    his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesn t advance   it convulses    from the script on out   it was probably all downhill    renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless   there s no fun in kicking a wounded dog   is there    
Pos, few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker s adaptation of frank mccourt s memoir angela s ashes    many dismissed it as an humorless   sentimentalized   uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel   others hailed it as a heartfelt   sincere portrait of the human spirit    i m somewhere in between   leaning strongly towards the latter    it s certainly well made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be    but i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two and a half hour running time that screams   i m important !    mccourt s book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900 s   a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us    as he comments     we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty      in ireland   frank   played by joe breen as a small child     his 3 brothers   his mother angela   emily watson   and his father malachy   robert carlyle   get financial help from angela s mother   a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman    she helps them get a rat infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job    positions are scarce and when he does finally find one   he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking    meanwhile   frank goes to an uptight catholic school   where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires    two of frank s brothers soon die   crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition    as if the poverty and the suffering weren t intense enough as it stood   malachy and angela have another baby   worsening the situation further    i imagine this doesn t sound like much of a plot    that s probably because it isn t one    these are people    this is their story    director alan parker   the commitments   knows how to tell a good story and angela s ashes   despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting    though the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting   it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue    supplementing parker s able direction are the engaging   often poignant performances of the leads   some of them seasoned thespians   others relative beginners    carlyle   the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama   perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character    we empathize with the guy   but we don t like or admire him    emily watson turns in a heartfelt   sincere supporting performance    it is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats    also worthy of mention is little joe breen   whose face graces the film s superb poster    it is breen s first feature film and he s extraordinary as young frank    not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense   you can peer into the character s soul through breen s sad eyes    on the flip side   one thing that could have vastly improved angela s ashes is a more decisive editor    while gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery   he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage    the first half   especially   could have been trimmed down   bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process    things pick up at about the halfway point   sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour   but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co   set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary     * spoiler warning !  skip next paragraph if in suspense ! *  the film s final message is somewhat conflicted   as frankie   in effect   leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america    what   exactly   are we supposed to make of that    his mother doesn t seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son   as any mother would   but it still seems inconsiderate of him    i haven t read the book   but i m sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein   therefore   i m suspicious    another thing that s never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title   which   i m sure   is also explained in the memoir    if seen as a film onto itself   rather than an adaptation   angela s ashes stands tall    despite a few minor setbacks   it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder    
Pos, i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of   good will hunting     based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film   in which the main character will hunting   matt damon     an mit janitor in his early twenties   is discovered to be an einstein level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight    the only problem is that will is a tough street kid who s had his share of run ins with the law   and before long he s being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight    professor lambeau   stellan skarsgard     who had brought up the math problems in his lectures   tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police   will is to be released   provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions    this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff   but   good will hunting   rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama    a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will s therapist sean mcguire   robin williams     lambeau wants to get will to use his brain   while sean wants him to listen to his heart   both of which he has been largely neglecting    will finds that the former is much easier than the latter   so much so   in fact   that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau s attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle    he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar   minnie driver     an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her    what makes   good will hunting   work so well   aside from the strong performances   especially from damon and williams     is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will s life    the script s sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau   but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong    lambeau   while he may seem a little cold at times   is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we re not sure if we like what he has to say    and sean   for all his warm heartedness   has   as lambeau and later will point out   not lived up to his full intellectual potential either   the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will    will s reaction to this situation   and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean   is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters  opinions   rather than setting up an obvious   right   and   wrong   side and beating them over the head with it    for a film with such an extraordinary character     good will hunting   presents itself as remarkably ordinary   it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman   a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another    this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama   by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far fetched situation       good will hunting   also has its share of fun humor   such as when will   in an early therapy session   pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture    and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear   will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa    will s relationship with his friends   most notably chucky   ben affleck     is usually rather amusing   if somewhat crude   the film has 100+ uses of the  f  word   which was most likely the reason for its r rating     and lends itself well to the development of will s character    add all this to the fact that   good will hunting   even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental   and you might be wondering why i haven t given this film four stars    well   for one thing   no matter how well damon and affleck   who wrote the screenplay   and director gus van sant pull it off   the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original    there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic   including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions    still     good will hunting   takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would   and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years   and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of  97 films    
Neg, in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french canadian co production by max fischer    the movie is set in paris where its hero   struggling american author david mirkine   judd nelson   at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity   suffers a terrible writers bloc    he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle   laurence treill      unfortunately   she hangs out in jet set circles   which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous    her connection with powerful david caravan   pierce brosnan   would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events    although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller   drama would probably be more appropriate genre label    pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers   and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments    low budget also becomes painfully visible   and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film    unfortunately   this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes   so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed    instead   they would have to settle with pointless   slow scenes involving nelson   brosnan and laurence treill s attempts of serious acting    all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone s precious time    
Neg, it seemed like the perfect concept    what better for the farrelly brothers   famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter   than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality    it s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish   poking fun at something serious   in this case mental illness     throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh    jim carrey s signed on too    even better    the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers  new film before its opening   claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality   labeling it incorrectly as   schizophrenia     and so forth    such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would   of course   only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers  fire   proving that some people just couldn t take a joke   and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy    yes   it all seemed perfect   but one thing went wrong   their movie isn t funny    it s not for lack of trying    the farrellys utilize in   me   myself & irene   their most high concept premise ever   carrey plays charlie baileygaites   a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver   decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them    this   of course   means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too forgiving nature   making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult    soon enough   charlie s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second   independent personality named hank   a deep voiced   boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster    this guy isn t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he s been insulted   or holding a little girl s head underwater because she refused to stop jump roping in the street    then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted   and the film runs off its tracks    some have suggested that this isn t a problem   because the farrelly brothers  brand of humor doesn t require plot to work    they re wrong   of course   plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys  last effort   1996 s   there s something about mary         1999 s   outside providence   was technically an earlier project      the brothers  earlier film wasn t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags   despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe     but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected    in   mary     the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight of hand trick   they d have you thinking the story was going one way   then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion       me   myself & irene     by contrast   seems to have been made by folks who looked at   mary   and saw only the surface grossness   missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work    having been produced by the same guys who made   mary       irene   seems like an even bigger disappointment    the brothers pile on the offensive humor   taking shots at race   midgets   albinos   mental illness   and all manner of bathroom jokes    but they haven t come up with a way to make any of it fresh   most of   me   myself & irene   comes off as rote   by the numbers   adolescent comedy    the plot   with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p   waters   renee zellweger     who s in more trouble than anyone knows   back to new york   has an ending that s entirely predictable from the get go       think charlie and irene will fall in love    yeah   me too      the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters   and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven t already expected them to do   no matter how outrageous their actions might be    compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing   this stuff is almost entirely soft tossed   presenting an obvious problem   when gross out humor loses its shock value   it s no longer funny   merely gross    the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry    take   for example   the subplot involving charlie s three black sons   anthony anderson   mongo brownlee   jerod mixon      the incongruity of it all is funny for a while   with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too pleasant smile on his face    but by the end of the film   they re still doing the same schitck   it hasn t been elevated to another   funnier level   and it hasn t been dropped either    that s too bad   because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through       me   myself & irene   reeks of wasted opportunities    there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie s new personality   and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank s actions    this doesn t really happen   nearly every supporting character learns about charlie s condition early on   so they don t have any opportunity to be surprised by it    the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point   involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called   appropriately     whitey       but the script doesn t go anywhere with it   instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax    jim carrey is a gifted comedian   both physically and vocally   but he s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in   all of me      it s a great showcase of flexibility and split second role shifting   but none of it is terribly funny    carrey doesn t pull any stunts we don t expect him to pull   and the farrellys  script doesn t give him anything else to pull   the situations in which he must perform the role shifting aren t set up in any meaningful way    perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better    zellweger s irene is not a strong female lead   mary in   mary   may have been part adolescent fantasy   but she was also intelligent and strong willed    irene is nothing in particular   as the film never makes clear whether she s ditzy   clever   or neither    as such   she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only   sane   person in the film    chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent   and his character is entirely too straight laced for a movie like this    he   like the others   does absolutely nothing unexpected    after viewing the shapeless mess that   me   myself & irene   eventually dissolved into   i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves    maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked    but i don t believe it    good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style    if the farrellys are indeed good   smart filmmakers   and i still think they are     they ll rebound just fine    even after that happens   though   i ll still consider   me   myself & irene   to be a high caliber misfire    
Pos, kadosh means sacred in hebrew    amos gitai s fictional work   after spending most of his career doing documentaries   is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage   even though the marriage is a loving one    the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli s modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic s intolerable one   as both groups are vying for control of the secular government    gitai   devarim/yom yom   is a labor party leftist   who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government   it would sound the death knell of israel    the emphasis of the film is on how the ultra orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god s law from only the male s view    that if they ever got control of the country   their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are    the story takes place in jerusalem s jewish quarters called mea shearim   where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls   and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life   which is much different than the way most jews live in israel    this is a controversial film   in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones   that the film is bound to anger most viewers   no matter their belief    it is a slow moving   meticulous film   that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go    the force of what is seen   though filmed in an objective manner   never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim   is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance    the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people   as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes   it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can t at present live in harmony with their own people   and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace    the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual   where every prayer is made to the virtues of god    he even thanks god that he didn t make him a woman    his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom    she looks at him with glistening eyes   not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life   and from seeing movies and tv    meir is a talmudic scholar    his father   abu warda   is a rabbi at the yeshiva    he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child    since the hasidim look upon a woman s role in life being only to conceive children   and cook and clean house for the man   while the man s role is to spend his time in prayer   therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage    she receives an anonymous letter that states   a woman without a child is no better than dead      meir s response   is that it is written like that in the talmud    meir s father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken     a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah      all the blame is placed on rivka   who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren    she will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself   as her rigid mother   koenig   dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel    their religion doesn t permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor    rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile   but she cannot tell him that because of their religion    so when meir s father chooses a younger woman for his son   she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters    rivka s spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life    she has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov    but   because of the way they were both raised   she is still a virgin    when yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon   something his sect is not allowed to do   he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer    he now works as a singer in a nightclub    malka s mother is worried that her daughter won t get married   so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef   someone whom she doesn t love    yossef is a very stern follower of the order   he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound truck with a bull horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies    the two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options   with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage   it will make her happy   but   while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it   she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage    the harshest scene in the film is on malka s wedding night    yossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs   and without the least bit of affection   only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies   as he goes inside her and rams her hard   thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love    the sisters have choices   like everyone else in life does    but the choices are obliterated by one s beliefs   circumstances   and inward nature   and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up    for the sisters   the choices are life or death ones    gitai by closing in on the daily rituals   tight living quarters and close knit community   has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life    the film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would   and everything seems strange to her   all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories   as she has made her choice   and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed    
Pos, not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies    like bergman   director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters  inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations    also like bergman   leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters  ravished and wracked faces    and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman s own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film    all that is missing is a discussion of god    which is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master    in fact   it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind    nonetheless   what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience    even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place    that it takes some effort to adjust to the film s rhythms    once the adjustment is made   however   there are great rewards    one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is    though leigh may have adopted some of bergman s stylistic touches   most obviously in an early scene of terse cross cutting during a married couple s strained conversation   as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score   the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any   style   at all    whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality   leigh makes the camera a mere observer   almost as in a pbs documentary    the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors    it is a tribute to everyone involved that   despite such scrutiny   only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting    much has been made of brenda blethyn s performance   and rightly so   but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is    there are a few missteps    for one   except for one scene   tragicomic   as it happens     there is scant humor in the film    this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout    and occasionally   as with bergman   the bluntness of the situations can seem forced    for all that   this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention    it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite   for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film    in fact   it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it    there is even a sweet but significant irony in the film s unspoken take on race relations   something an american audience at least would do well to observe    nonetheless   secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart    though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish   the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen    needless to say   it is also very depressing at times    but for many of us   of course   so is life    and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending   that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better    
Pos, seen may 31   1999 on home video   rented      one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own   everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise    with some films it might be just a secondary issue   but with `dark city  what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are   which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie    there s an old role playing computer game called `d   ja v     wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can t remember who he is   where he is and how he got there    the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict    the premise to this film is not unlike that game   only this time we don t have control over the protagonist    we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city   actually   it s more than just the city   it s the whole reality   that isn t just that neo gothic look   a la `batman     `blade runner         but is so fully developed it s almost a different genre completely    later he will learn that his name is john murdoch   sewell     but for now he has no idea what s going on other than the fact something is not right    the fact there s a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious   hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling    this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre   horrific tone    the man doesn t know who he is nor where he s going and it s interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him    in fact   this is the way all stories begin since it s impossible to know the history of a character   their feelings   values   morals   etc   until after we ve observed them for a while    but in this case   the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization   developing the mood and outlining the story    eventually   some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police    we met inspector frank bumstead   hurt     a quiet   unemotional   soft spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time    two other important characters are also introduced   dr   daniel p   schreber   sutherland     a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john s doctor   and emma murdoch   connelly     a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film noir movies    it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film    he also contacts emma   which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex   mysterious back story    but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city     which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo    everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance   considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot   its lighting   art direction and overall production design   they don t seem to be able to afford any gratuities    however   that might also be what s keeping it from reaching its maximum potential    by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place   so much unlike the real world we know   we come to realize that it s all a hoax    everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction    but   as the film s tagline says   `last night   one of us went off      for reasons that are never clearly explained   it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive   a process known as `tuning       the aliens   which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin   also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight    at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made   they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then    this premise certainly is interesting and director and co screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard    he does provide some explanations such as that dr   schreber is an assistant to `the strangers  because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form    the aliens mix and match the memories of the city s population to see who will change and who will not    in the process this creates for a good deal of deep   thought provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world    however   where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is    the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened   yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant   static and cold   mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don t help either      for example   john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her   yet in some scenes crucial to the film s plot   we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other   which is also part of the film s climax and ending    and that s what proyas seems to be inferring with the film   but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense    ironically   this is what made his first film `the crow  work so well   which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical   dark twisted world    with `dark city  the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message    still   the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable    there s a lot to like here   most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does    the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years    `dark city  is what the movies are all about   the escape from the real world    
Neg, sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things   and   pushing tin   certainly features some name stars who are going places   billy bob thornton   cate blanchett   angelina jolie   and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first   but he s actually the * veteran * among this quartet of fine looking people    sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has   hip comedy   written all over it   compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction   compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits   compensate for clich   d characterizations   compensate for embarrassing   you have to be joking   situations    etc    in   pushing tin     thornton   blanchett   jolie   and cusack don t have an earthly    from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble   squiggly     quirky   credits   fake looking passenger planes circling new york   and anne dudley s in your ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for   the full monty     let alone won it    but i   for one   wasn t ready to walk just yet    so quickly we descend into a tightly edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job   yes   what with their frantic   mile a minute instructional personas   juggling planes and passenger s lives like some huge   real   mid air video game    hip   cool   demonic auctioneer nick   the zone   falzone   cusack   is the best in the biz    of course    until some hipper   cooler   leather clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell   thornton   shows up to challenge falzone s finite air space    boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding   then the macho one upmanship begins    it doesn t stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat s whisker of each other    oh no    there are some broken hoop dreams   some wanna see how fast i can drives   and then the ultimate showdown   was that my wife i saw you with last night    director mike newell     four weddings and a funeral     must have read a different draft of this script because the one that s being acted out up there between newark   jfk   and la guardia doesn t have an ounce of subtlety   and newell has made some awfully good and funny movies before    the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe    they ll make you frown in disbelief    they ll have you constantly looking at your watch    but wait !  there s still 100 minutes to go ! !  the film s only saving grace is blanchett   whose connie falzone is a spunky   brash   long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes    this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red headed australian gambler     oscar and lucinda     and a tempestuous british monarch     elizabeth        but she s not enough to save the picture    thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is a joke    jolie   as russell s knock  em dead wife   isn t bad   but the up and coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything    cusack cracks gum   dons shades   and acts hip throughout but   like everything else in the film   his performance is forced    in the last ten minutes or so   for some inexplicable reason   things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been   like the trailer teases    but it s too little too late    a fine cast aside     pushing tin   is nothing more than an embarrassment    
Neg, staring   george clooney   arnold schwarzenegger   chris o donnell and uma thurman with alicia silverstone    well to start this off i d just like to say a couple things    first is   i miss michael keaton   i miss tim burton and would much prefer to think that these last two batman films are all like a dallas dream sequence    not even from the first film was batman really the  star  though he was damn close in the first couple anyway    in  batman forever  and now in  batman & robin  he s almost pushed to being a bit player    i can t really say if clooney   who regardless was better than kilmer   was a very good batman or not    he s given next to nothing to do at all   he might as well not have been there and it wouldn t have made much difference    now   joel schumacher has said that he refuses to bend to the masses that have hated his films and cheered for the return of buton that he wont make batman brooding and dark    fine   i mean granted  batman returns  while being an awsome film was a bit to dark sometimes    yet his bright neon   campy style is just killing anything this series meant to me    i m usually very easy on films    i loved  con air  and other films some critics have slammed    granted that film really was paper thin   cliche ridden   except for one thing   it was fun    there is virtually no fun in this film at all    i couldn t have cared less    it ll thrill the little ones as theres no violence really   none everyone comes out fine in the end like those old tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing    schwarzenegger is awful   i mean really   really bad        and this is coming from a regular fan of his work    i love his movies most of the time and the basic reason is he never says much in any of them    he talks all to often in this movie    i would have much prefered to have seen patric stewart in the roll    i believe to truely like a film you have to care about at least someone in a film    i liked alfred but the reason behind it is a cheap shot    
Pos, synopsis   shrek   myers   is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest   until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad   john lithgow      farquaad agrees to relocate the pests   on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona   diaz      whom farquaad desires to wed    from a far off castle    grudgingly   shrek sets out   joined in his quest by an unwanted companion   donkey   murphy      review   one memorable aspect of disney s   aladdin   was that it finally gave robin williams a character    the genie    to best take advantage of his comic talents       shrek   does the same for eddie murphy   ironically   though   murphy s ideal vessel turns out to be an ass    all the same     shrek   does represent murphy s best comic outing in years   and as donkey he steals all the best lines    for instance   after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature   donkey soars into the air and scoffs     now i m a flying talking donkey !    and despite its many contributors   the script for   shrek   is full of such comic gems    myers is delightful in more of a straight man role   and lithgow also gets some great moments   watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man         shrek   takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts   and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain    things do go somewhat astray during the film s middle segment   which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie s greatest strength    but even then   one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation   whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology    
Pos, tempe mills cinema   az  this movie had us in non stop stitches from beginning to end    all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie    if you thought they were funny   see the rest of the movie    it s hilarious    how does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head bopping on snl to exactly one song    easy    write an interesting script around tried and true ideas   add some good lines and satire   and voil     you end up with an excellent   well done   very entertaining flick    will and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day    at night they pursue their life long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills   ca   the only disco act worth going to    the only problem   the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door   the roxbury closes   all the while bearing witness to guys with one hundred dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss    the script authors   steve koren   will ferrell and chris kattan   cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury    their flower shop van is rear ended by richard grieco   who fears a law suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star struck to think about the car accident they just had   but not about getting into the roxbury    grieco happily takes them in   even introduces them to the owner   which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers   elisa donovan and gigi rice   who bet their time and bodies on will and chris    what follows are some of the best slap stick dancing routines ever    the music is superb   and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez s born to be alive    the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by   for example   the bee gees and their stayin  alive    it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back   and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump    one of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will  and chris don t have any mone y   and dump both on the spot   even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away    an art imitates life poke at shallow women    it s a scene that s an approximate parody of the vinegar s own rolf luedeke s editorial this week national organization for men   nom   replaces now    ted   unabomber    kaczynski   himself rejected for not having money   will identify well with this scene   if he ever watches the movie    of course   the script wouldn t be complicated enough without adding molly shannon   the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids   and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good looking disco blondes   proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby      nevertheless   will s father wants him to marry molly anyway   but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest quarter exile    during the wedding ceremony   will s heart isn t exactly into getting married   and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head bopping music   will thinks worse of the knot tieing idea and runs to chris    definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony    i found this scene a riot   however   it went over brandi s head    she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared    the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries   instead   the step in buddy/weight lifter   who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy   and who has been lusting for a good looker for a long time   but ready now to take anyone    more art imitates life stuff    not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world    the idiots  mother is played by loni anderson   whose barbie doll looks  don t play well anymore   she s a bit old     and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down    i recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in  need of a lot of laughs    go with a date    brandi laughed non stop   as i  did   and a deaf mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for 105 minutes    
Pos, the deer hunter   directed by michael cimino   is truly one of the greatest movies ever made    a captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russian american pennsylvania community   the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget    in this academy award winner for best picture of 1978   outstanding performances are turned in by all actors   and cimino s brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character s lives    the first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together    michael   portrayed perfectly by robert de niro   is shown early on as the natural leader of the group    after a days work   the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar   where john   george dzundza   works    three of the men   michael   steven   john savage     and nick   christopher walken   will be leaving shortly for vietnam   but not before steven gets married    after the marriage   the group   including axel   chuck aspegren     spend one last day on a hunting trip   one of their favorite past times    this sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men   who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war    the wedding scenes   although criticized by many as being quite long   actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act    the outstanding performances by de niro   walken   streep   savage   and cazale   who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed   really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future    the second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam   stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong    the men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river    this prison   run by the v   c      initiates the horrifying scenes in the movie   where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other    steven   who is emotionally marred by this turn of events   is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate    michael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other   and moreover   they must play with 3 bullets in the gun    personally   i felt that de niro s absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes    the men are eventually able to escape   but are separated    michael is able to get steven   who ends up losing his legs   to medical care   while nick finds his way to saigon and a u   s   army hospital    michael returns home and does not feel at all like a hero    he wants to avoid the celebrations and recognition that his friends would like to bestow upon him    he assumes that nick is still lost in vietnam    the third act concentrates more on walken s character   who eventually stumbles upon a small gambling operation where the game is   again   russian roulette    only in this game   you play for money    michael has learned that nick is possibly still alive and returns to saigon to attempt to find him    the two narrowly find each other at the russian roulette games   but do not link up until michael discovers nick participating in the games and tries to bring him home    a very emotional   and   for many   a very disturbing movie   the deer hunter is a truly magnificent movie that should not be missed    the greatest performances possible are turned in by all actors   and cimino s directing   which is considered to be at his all time best in this film   is equally dazzling    do not miss this film   it will captivate and astound you    
Pos, up until about a year ago   john travolta s career consisted of those   look who s talking   movies   notice how they never called them look who s talented   and the 1991 bomb shout   which was bad enough to make most people scream      but somewhere along the line   travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again    weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again   while barry   robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight to the cutout bin album aptly named   size isn t everything     and of course   they learned that sales are everything      but now travolta s back on the hollywood scene once again   and i think we all know why    four words   contract with the devil    and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich s   contract with america      no   satan is much more humane    anyway   yes   travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld    how do i know    i own the document in question    amazing what you can buy at those collector s shops for a few hundred dollars   isn t it    get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction   with travolta as crime minion chili palmer    he goes to collect some of the mafia s money from a b grade director   gene hackman   and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game    sure   a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood   but i guess that s beside the point    palmer is determined to get hackman s next project made   so he sets out to convince big star martin weir   danny devito   to star in the movie   bringing along down and out horror actress karen flores   rene russo     who has already had affairs with hackman and devito    it doesn t take a las vegas odds maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well   after the customary sexual tension and denial   which has been used in every comedy from   who s the boss      to speechless    it works in this case   unlike   who s the boss      although it s interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also    complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman s other films and want in on this one too   along with travolta s mob boss trying to track him down for defecting    get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction   despite the obvious similarities    this movie doesn t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i ve seen this year   yes   even better than halloween vi      get shorty is my kind of movie   one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence    i m definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on    are you getting this   shorty    
Pos, us critic type people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies aren t thrill rides   but i think that   back to the future ii   is one of the few exceptions    if the original film had the spirit of the 1950s   then this has the spirit of the 80s   full of fights   chase scenes   cliff hangers   special effects   some detective work   and of course the vision of the high tech future    the film picks up exactly where the first film left off   with doc   lloyd     marty   fox     and jennifer   elizabeth shue   travelling 30 years into the future   because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifer s kids    doc tells marty he must take his son s place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr   says yes to griff   wilson   in one of four different roles      whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn t joking   especially when it comes to the movies    essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015   but it s not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself    at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better   and it seems like everything s copasetic right    wrong    since when do things go according to plan in the   back to the future   movies    there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i won t even bother to list them all    basically we get to see marty as an old man   his house   his family   etc   we also go back to an alternate 1985   and then back again to 1955   with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath    the films  best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle    it s difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail    the only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense    instead of a grand finale   we get lots of little victories    by the end everything is back to normal   but something happens that leads to yet another sequel   but it doesn t seem gratuitous       back to the future part ii   is a really great adventure movie    it certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor    
Neg, warner brothers has scored another marketing coup    the one two punch was started in the summer   with the release of batman forever    trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat   ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel    carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video   $11   99 at wal mart     a mere two weeks before carrey s return in this marketwise   but misfired comedy    ace ventura   when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubber faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment    he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher   in batman forever   but   here   left to his own devices   carrey quickly wears out his welcome    the opening sequence is by far the best  an amusing spoof of cliffhanger   with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon       you can guess what happens to mr   paws    hint   it sounds like splat      the plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas   and then to not so darkest africa   where ace is on the case of a missing white bat    with his hair and limbs both wildly askew   carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes    the rest of the film is just more of the same    sure   the plot s linear   and the production values solid   but where is the scripted humor to support carrey s sloppy slathering    writer and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set ups    instead   carrey just mugs away   playing for the camera even when most of it isn t funny    the better gags have been shown in the ads   though a bit with ace emerging buck naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see    though an arguable improvement over the original   ace ventura   when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten    the script is virtually devoid of wit    tribal mask jokes    jerry lewis cameos    forget it    if anything   the inexplicable presence of simon callow   four weddings and a funeral   and bob gunton   the shawshank redemption   suggests that working with carrey is the classical actor s ultimate challenge    just how long * can * they keep a straight face    
Pos, warning   contains what the matrix is    rated r for sci fi violence    starring   keanu reeves   laurence fishburne   joe panteliano  some may be disappointed with the matrix    i ll tell you i was    i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen    now wait wait   i know most of you loved it   and i m not saying i didn t like it    what i m saying is the first half was extremely slow    now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show    don t be fooled   this movie has a big story    and big chunks of talky moments    but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par   deserving the rating above    ok now to the story    well this may take a while    ok first of all   our world we live in now   is not the real world   actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix    a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out   when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world    he does so   and finds out that he can do anything   be anything he wants to be    but he has to fight a  matrix skipping  bad guy   who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him    laurence fishburne   his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves    but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were    yeah there were some in the first half but not enough    the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie    now for the second half   it is explosive   and saves the movie    some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking    the sound   the music   and all the effects were effective   and the last hour kept us entertained    but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes   this movie is at least 40 minutes too long    one would have wished for a better  matrix    but i do have to say   i did like it and i was entertained    
Neg, warren beatty   diane keaton   goldie hawn and gary shandling star as a pair of married couples whose complacent lives are about to be shaken up in director peter chelsom s version of the classic romantic   screwball comedy in   town & country      the drawing room farce of the 30 s dealt with sexual innuendo and relied on wit and a great deal of commotion and noise to place the viewer in the thick of the duplicitous romantic action    back then   impossibly wealthy scions of society   with too much free time   would get themselves wrapped up in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses and lovers   only to have everything come out all right in the end   see   the philadelphia story   for a great farce       town & country   has the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free time   the kind of people that have jobs but never seem to work   and sexual misconduct on several levels    but   there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin and buck henry and this is   t&c s   downfall    there is   obviously   a great deal of hollywood talent   in front of and behind the camera   involved in   town & country     but   without a likable or   at least   interesting story to carry through their efforts   it is all for naught    and   that s what we get here   naught    porter stoddard   beatty   is a high powered new york architect with a very good life indeed    his 25 year marriage to ellie   diane keaton   appears   on the surface   to be perfect    but   there are cracks just below this pristine surface    his wife is suspicious of his whereabouts   his kids don t need him and his best friends   griffin   garry shandling   and mona   goldie hawn     are in the midst of a divorce    porter tries to get control of his life before it is too late   but like a man fighting against quicksand   his struggle just sinks him deeper    at the 90 minute mark of   town & country   i asked myself     what s the point      i wasn t entertained   i laughed three times   over silly little pratfalls   and spent most of the film marking time  til the end    warren beatty wanders around with his character in a bewildered fog   making problems for himself by thinking with a part of his anatomy other than his head    keaton s ellie is an empty headed flake who can t see the obvious as porter screws around on her    and   as you get to know them   who would want friends like griffin and mona    the supporting cast is given nothing to do and   sometimes   does harm to the film   given the material they are forced to use    nastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling    the actress   who has   eerily   failed to age over the years   is miscast as the air headed musician and the character doesn t belong   anyway    jenna elfman is a sweet   but smart   ditz who joins porter and griffin on one of their tacked on misadventures    andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress   is there any other kind in this movie      who comes on to porter    the saving grace is a pair of quirky perf s by charlton heston and marian seldes as macdowell s very strange parents    glib rationalization of infidelity   like     if he doesn t speak english   it doesn t count     are a staple for the screenplay    the morality of the film seems to be   if you can get away with it   go for it    the cast of characters are mostly people you wouldn t want to know   never mind befriend    the actors do their best   but are hamstrung by the weak material    helmer chelsom   who made the outstanding   offbeat comedy   funny bones     is mired in the mess of a script and never puts his imprint on   town & country      the production values are high   as one expects from a big budget hollywood film    but   the opulent sets by caroline hanania   lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis and top notch photography by william fraker cannot save   town & country      the film has had a long list of production and distribution problems and it might have been better   for me anyway   if hollywood just said no to this movie    i give it a d    
Pos, you ve seen this moment before   recently   a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing    the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor s nell in the haunting   we don t care    the hero of the sixth sense   a young boy named cole   is a rich creation   and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike    the seasons have changed since an ex patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe   willis   in the comfort of his own bedroom    desperate to get his career back on track   even at the expense of his crumbling marriage   to williams   of rushmore     malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole   osment      the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm s would be killer   scars on his body   antisocial behaviour   and the reluctance to reveal a big secret    only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies   and hospitalized as a result   does he divulge to malcolm   in a spine tingling scene   that he sees dead people walking among us   all the time    malcolm assumes   and given his profession   reasonably so   that cole is schizophrenic   not psychic   but the sincerity in cole s anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures    he will instead pursue the supernatural angle   becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole   who lives with his single mother   lynn   collette     in the process    the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist       though shyamalan does   somewhat unforgiveably   crib the self rearranging kitchen business from the latter      it s far more heartwarming than frightening   and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks    cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown   but they re not out to harm him   really they just want to be heard   even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler    perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us   at first   than they really are because we re looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight year old    that s right   willis   for the first time in years   gives up the spotlight to his costar    we appreciate malcolm s domestic dilemma   but we identify with cole   recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed    both actors deliver immensely likable performances   and their dynamic is manifest    willis convinces us that he s a doctor   something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night    osment is phenomenal   a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do    the sixth sense   atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs  cinematographer   tak fujimoto   is actually a drama its spooky   effective ad campaign is misleading    only because i was expecting something different did i notice rather   feel the movie s running time   which is just shy of two hours    the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly   its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait    i m not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof   but i admired its audacity    
Pos,    sometimes the  green mile  seems sooooo long      indeed    and any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review    on a more positive note   let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length    the mile in question   green due to its faded lime colored linoleum   leads from the prison cell to   old sparky     the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisiana s cold mountain penitentiary in 1935    paul edgecomb   tom hanks   you ve got mail   is the head guard of e block   otherwise known as death row    keeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility    it is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they   talk to   the convicts instead of yelling at them    this practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars    into his charge comes one john coffey   michael clarke duncan   armageddon     a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls    immediately   paul senses something different about this prisoner    perhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark    or perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he   takes back   paul s bladder infection thereby restoring him to health    based on steven king s 1996 serialized novel   the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told   eduard delacroix   michael jeter   patch adams     is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks   percy wetmore   doug hutchison   a time to kill     is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner   fry   up close   and hal moores   james cromwell   babe   pig in the city   is the compassionate warden for whom   despite all the executions he s witnessed   death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor    while it is mr   hanks   everyman   performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes   it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting    all involved do credible work in their respective roles   most especially mr   duncan   who turns in an impressive   fully realized characterization    if only the story were more credible    writer/director frank darabont   the shawshank redemption   has crafted a flawed fantasy/allegory of sorts   one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual   relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power    mr   darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters    was it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed    by not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts  presence on e block   the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out   making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted    this is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched    much has also been made of coffey s christ like ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures   coffey s powers are shrouded in mystery   taking on the feel of a circus trick   coupled with a voodoo like   i feel your pain   transference    in contrast   there is no mystery associated with the healing that is from god    the genuine   gifts of healing   listed in 1 corinthians 12 is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god    true spiritual healing   with few exceptions   requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed    such believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism   but from the revealed word of god    
Pos, because the press screening of   planet of the apes   was one day past last issue s deadline   i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time   listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece    the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance   that the story was thin   that mark wahlberg s character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked    to those people i would like to say   what the hell did you expect    this is a tim burton movie   boys and girls    tim burton movies have great art direction and thin   clunky stories    for the blissfully nasty   disjointed and underrated   mars attacks !       jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie   burton reportedly tossed vintage   mars attacks !    trading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up    burton s re imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great    the apes   courtesy of make up magician rick baker   are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold    like astronaut leo davidson   wahlberg     the film hits the ground running   whisking viewers through a head spinning series of solid one liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later    as for wahlberg   consider what burton does with his character    from his start as a filmmaker   burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits   pee wee herman   the joker   ed wood   the ack acking martians   etc     and lack of interest in standard issue heroes    so leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders    as for lack of color   remember   leo only launches into space to get his monkey back    he doesn t want to lead humanity and he isn t looking for romance from a pretty   but dull human   estella warren   or a dynamic ape   helena bonham carter   terrific as an equal rights activist      as a man who just wants out   wahlberg is focused   subtle and sly    the surprise ending provides the requisite shock   and some more dandy visuals   particularly of the approaching authority figures     but admittedly isn t nearly as satisfying as the one in the original    for the original ending to work   we only had to make one simple connection   for this one   we have to write a whole new screenplay    the 1968   apes   boasted a handful of great scenes   cool looking monkeys   a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston   who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed   re delivering a classic line   and a killer ending    but viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball    the 2001   planet of the apes   offers a different set of great scenes   much cooler looking monkeys   fine acting from wahlberg   bonham carter   paul giamatti and tim roth   and a not so good ending    it also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that s nothing to complain about    
Neg, everybody in this film s thinking of alicia    no   this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the   cryin    video    this is one of those erotic thrillers   but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed    first off   there s zero sex   almost no nudity   and it s not as well plotted as one of those tweed flicks    well   anyway    the   plot      alicia plays   well   the babysitter   who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents   j   t    walsh and lee garlington   go out to a party    the film   trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers   shows every characters  thoughts   except alicia s    the thing is alicia s in most of them in most cases   and the thoughts aren t too kosher    first off   there s her boyfriend   jeremy london   who gave one of the all time lousy performances in   mallrats     and is only a notch better here     who s a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully   played by nicky katt from   suburbia     who shows he s got that quiet creepiness down pat once again      they decide they want to crash her babysitting job   looking for the typical babysitting hanky panky    somethine like that    the film intercuts between the subplots   alicia babysitting   nicky and jeremy   the party   and each characters  thoughts    we get to see jeremy and nicky s dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia   j   t    thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub   she has it all covered up   the little tease     and   worst of all   lee garlington dreaming of that hunk   george segal    it even shows them in bed together    yea    i so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed   though i guess i m used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in   flirting with disaster      the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing   but come on    like we care about any of the characters    the only interesting one is alicia   mainly because she s alicia   and we mostly see her in the fantasies    so i guess she s some kind of mystery or something    but she is never explored further    so   basically   this film is just a series of mastabatory images   sometimes featuring a non nude alicia   once again   sadly     sometimes featuring a scantily clad george segal   once again   sadly      i watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night   and let me tell you   it is the only way to watch this film    i mean   there s a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night   they re just as good as sleeping pills    and this one is one big fat waste of time   even for an alicia film    
Neg, i love movies    i really do    every time i watch great movies like goodfellas   1990   or raiders of the lost ark   1981     a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent   skill and entertainment that is on display    even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3   1994   or ghostbusters ii   1988   while not exactly brilliantly well made   are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value    then there s my favourite martian   the exact opposite of what a movie should be   a hurried   poorly written and acted movie with one goal   to make money    disney   ever since the lion king   1994   have lost their magic touch   but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk    christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t   v reporter s tim o hara car   daniels     and soon tim finds the martian in his home   trying to recover and fix his spaceship    along with his  zoot  spacesuit   voiced by wayne knight   must fix his spaceship before it explodes   and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public   firstly by o hara   but later by rival t   v presenter brace channing   hurley     by calling himself tim s  uncle martin       laughter  is supposed to arise from the  comical  events   but never does    many bad films have good intentions   but my favourite martian doesn t appear to try to provide any entertainment    filled to the brim with wham bang special effects   my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy    christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie   i ve never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now    jeff daniels plays  staple nice guy  and his role is useless    his performance is incredibly lazy   although his paperthin character doesn t deserve more than the performance he gives    darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever   but her role is somewhat   erm   limited    hurley mistakes  acting  for  shouting and looking like a twit  and wins the david wilcock award for  most irritating   godawful performance in a moving picture      way to go liz !  for the supporting cast   disney manage to assemble every character actor out there   during the film i was going  he was the guy in       ah     er          before finally giving up and switching off    another major setback is the staple  comedy sidekick      unfortunately   the writers   sherri stoner and deanna oliver   if anyone cares   forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be  funny      instead   they deliver zoot   the martians deeply unfunny sidekick    although meant to be a manic character no doubt   every line that comes out of his  neck  is a dud    a real dud    citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester    even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character   not one child even bothered to smirk    it s a nice special effect   though    another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves    or rather   the lack of them    my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour   it goes past the bowl   down the pipe and into the sewer    now   toilet humour can be funny   as dumb and dumber   1994   humorously showed    but here   characters farting   belching and almost getting crapped on   literally   is not  amusing      it s insulting    there s one good gag right before the credits   but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued    either that   or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn t mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes    yes   men at work    yowza !  the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film   and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more    there are thousands of brilliant films out there that can t get distribution   yet trash like this gets released nation wide with ease    thankfully   as soon as it makes it s money   it will never be seen again   and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie   down the toilet    
Neg, if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film   it was studio 54   the late steve rubell s infamous new york discotheque   which came to symbolize the taboo smashing excesses of the disco era s heyday   easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone   all set to a thumping dance beat    so when miramax started production on  54  last year   the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began   an edgy film as down and dirty as the club itself   written and directed by a promising first timer   mark christopher   and starring some hot young talent   salma hayek   neve campbell   newcomer ryan phillippe   and mike myers in his dramatic debut      my   how easily does the worm turn    hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th hour reshoots   wrapped only a month ago     a rash of studio imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew   especially christopher   unhappy   and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics    at the last minute   though   miramax did decide to screen the film   so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers s last name was misspelled on the invitation   not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes   for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed   myself included    and with good reason  somehow   some way   the supremely disappointing  54  has made the historically hip haven of hedonism        boring    although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film   he still must shoulder some of the blame for  54  s lifelessness     54  focuses   for the most part   on a tight knit trio of employees at the club   coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita   a wasted hayek     her busboy husband   greg   breckin meyer     and   most prominently   the fresh from jersey shane o shea   phillippe     who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender    these characters are about as generic as those descriptions    in focusing on the hired help   christopher really missed the boat    with the exception of the flamboyant   always woozy rubell   myers   in a well modulated turn     the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers  but those of the people who went there to party   not necessarily the numerous vip guests   but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club s famously hard ass doormen and dance   among other things   the night away with the rich   famous   and infamous   the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow s feisty dottie   a disco  and drug crazed granny   but she s a peripheral character at best      as such   aside from the expected overhead crowd shots   there is precious little actual  dancing  in  54     what is a disco film  especially one about the pinnacle of the movement  without the dancing    even whit stillman s  the last days of disco    which wasn t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip to only themselves club hopping preppies   featured at least one extended dance scene    dancing isn t the only thing glazed over in  54   so is the sex   but that may not be entirely christopher s fault    from what i ve heard   his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring   starting with the shane character   he was conceived   and actually filmed   as a wild   morally ambiguous bisexual   which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54 s legend    but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut   shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out   consequently   so was the film    aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film   shane s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie   sela ward     and an abbreviated bedhopping montage   the sexual dimension is just about ignored    shane   in this incarnation   is sanitized to the point of blandness   an idealistic do gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club   julie black   campbell     a worldly soap star with   yes   a heart of gold    this tacked on   romance   would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience    they fail on both counts    ultimately    54  s failure comes down to three letters   f u n    as in   there isn t any to be had for the audience    too much time is spent with the boring shane   and too little is spent on the club floor   where all the action took place    anyhow   though   whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively    when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club   it should be a euphoric height   for her   the crowd   and the audience   however   the moment doesn t get a chance to reach that level   for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality   which also mars the film s conclusion   one of the last minute reshoots      strangely upbeat and wistful   the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying    there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there  two of them   in fact  but  54  is not one of them    they re on cable tv   a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1    these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings on within it show that there s still a great disco movie to be made    the problem is   after the critical and certain box office failure of  54    the subject may have run its hollywood course    
Neg, if you re going to make a two hour hollywood in joke   why bother releasing it to the general public    if you re going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big name actors and people who know woody allen   then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters    while watching celebrity   i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people    what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self deprecation    celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself   living in a world that he s familiar with   dealing with people like the ones he actually knows    allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture   in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more    branagh plays lee simon   a journalist turned screenwriter who divorces his wife   robin   judy davis     shacks up with some hot women   famke janssen   charlize theron   winona ryder     and goes about trying to get big stars   melanie griffith   leonardo dicaprio   to read his script about an armored car robbery    the usual elements of recent allen films are all here   including the sexual insecurity of the main character   lots of self loathing women   and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another    unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally   it s not likely that you ll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity    aside from all the in jokes   the story falls far short of compelling   and the characters are all empty and lifeless    branagh proves once again that he s a superb performer   nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly    the problem is that he s the same character allen always plays   a character who s getting more than a little dull to watch    i mean   come on   how many times have you seen this guy       he hates his work   and he can t be satisfied by any one woman   and   at the end of the movie   nothing has been solved    he brings all of his problems upon himself   crashing his car because he s receiving fellatio   and other such stunts     so it s pretty hard to care about him    in addition   isn t allen capable of creating characters who aren t just like him    i know he is   but he didn t do it in celebrity    the vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances    davis   playing the same woman with low self esteem that she played in deconstructing harry   has a few touching moments   but ends up the same despicable celebrity type that fills the rest of the movie    some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty    theron and ryder   especially    but they re not likable people    only famke janssen   as a book editor interested in simon s new novel   has any life    the men in the picture don t do much better    joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin   while dicaprio   as a christian slater/johnny depp type spoiled young actor   is funny but disengaging    what s really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its   themes   are    allen seems to think that he s making an insightful movie about the way   normal   people look at celebrities    the main problem with this is that the character with whom we re supposed to identify   simon   is not a   normal   guy    he s just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters    the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us    none of them register as realistic   interesting characters   they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue    in addition   allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly   robin   in this scene   says something like     it s interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate !        celebrity is arguably allen s biggest misfire to date    it does have a few good scenes    theron s super orgasmic model character is kind of funny   and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two    but celebrity is a failure at the core   unless allen s point was to make a self indulgent movie about himself and his friends    if he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke   then he succeeded in that    i   for one   don t enjoy feeling like an outsider    
Pos, it is simply amazing how   the green mile   developed in its three hour running time    based on the stephen king series of the same title   the film starts out painfully slow   with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue    however   as the plot begins to progress   the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction    frank darabont   who masterfully followed a prisoner s story in   the shawshank redemption     this time follows the perspective of a prison guard   paul edgecomb   tom hanks      through edgecomb s experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent   the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law    from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner     the green mile   is successful in creating sympathy for kind hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners    the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them    the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb    the ensemble acting in the film is perfect    hanks   david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles    they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles    they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience    the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting    some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson   sam rockwell   and michael duncan    hutchinson   playing percy wetmore   a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie    every time he appears on the screen   the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying    it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor   not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore   but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks    rockwell   an independent film veteran   plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection    as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours   he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others    this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable    the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan   as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill    duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child like behemoth   very similar to lennie small in of mice and men    his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause    his pain creates pain for the viewer    however   it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film    the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at   the jerry springer show      the scene   containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks    not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place   but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief    as the film flashes back to 1935   graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction    his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is   the scene is neither sad nor convincing    greene is not even given a final word   like some of the other characters   and we don t even see him walk the infamous green mile    however   as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters   such as coffey and eduard delacroix   michael jeter   as well as the five prison guards   the film becomes more interesting    the speed in   the green mile   is perfect    if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark   it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others    the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film   a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character       the green mile   is so good following the rough beginning   that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes   it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene    fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing    if you survive the first third of   the green mile   sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment    
Neg, it s amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest stand up around but completely fall flat in the movies    take adam sandler    on the basis of his first two cds     they re all gonna laugh at you !    and   what the hell happened to me          he s the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams    but when you put him in front of a camera   it just isn t the same    i kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation   but his latest film   the waterboy is about as funny as a root canal    seriously   i m willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here    in fact   i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic    the first half hour generated not one smile in me   with it s scenes of emotional abuse towards adam s character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players   but also by his very disturbed mother   kathy bates   what is the world coming to        granted   after the film gets rolling   there are a few mild chuckles throughout   i m even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice     but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for it s nearly hour and a half running time    you re all familiar with the plot because you ve seen it at least a million times before   everyone picks on the hero until he shows a hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions   in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves    and believe me   i m not giving anything away by saying that sandler s team wins    if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie   then god be with you    the only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobby s love interest    i mean   they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose   but they do extremely well with what they are given here    kudos to both of them    my advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin   who made a very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen    rely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh    or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have   like jim carrey did with the recent truman show    with the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses   he just can t keep going on like this    
Neg, overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name   based on shirley jackson s novel   the haunting of hill house     stars lili taylor as one of three   lab rats   that participate in a supposed   insomnia   study being initiated by liam neeson    he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it    he drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of   creepy   cgi effects scare the cast and try the audience s patience    i know this question has been posed before   but why do people keep remaking good movies    the original was a great psychological horror film    this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary    in fact   i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg 13 horror movie that is scary    unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening   then there s nothing in this film that will raise hackles    i nearly fell asleep twice during the film   and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn t seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed    it s sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly    owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house   and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability    catherine zeta jones   always nice to look at   is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs    liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what s going on as the rest of them do    finally   poor lili taylor   the center of the film   gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her    apparently   a subplot involving a tryst between zeta jones and taylor s characters was filmed but removed    that s too bad   because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative    this is jan de bont s second straight misfire   speed 2   cruise control being the first      when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better    robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that    one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset    if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything   it would have served to make the film terrifying    what our mind fashions on it s own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything    apparently   yet another version of this story is being filmed under it s original title    i certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bont s version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had    [pg 13]

Neg, salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets    actors who demand such salaries might be greedy   but in some instances they are quite justified   because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation    proof for that can be found even in the realm of low budget movies   and one fine example is breakaway   1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring   in   famous figure skater tonya harding    face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie s poster   but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra   attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster    one day she decides to retire   but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that    realising that her life suddenly became worthless   myra starts running for her life   followed by professional assassins    terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater    although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities   her acting leaves much to be desired    on the other hand   her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality   believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b films a bad name    martin sheen s brother joe estevez   whose character looks like he had entered from another movies  set   is the only bright spot of breakaway    unfortunately   he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding s silver screen debut proved to be her last film

every character the same    the caveman s valentine  is a concept so   high concept   that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment   with romulus s   caveman   a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane s urban noir hero   spawn    with a long vanished wife   tamara tunie   acting as a spiritual guide   the occasional social caste commentary   the secret base in a cave   a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters   and a wickedly colourful arch enemy   the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren t inscribed with   gotham pd      that being said    the caveman s valentine  can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy   a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart    the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when   in fact    the caveman s valentine  is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless   again like mcfarlane s spawn   while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts    it is no small detail that our hero   romulus   is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life   in legend   without knowledge of his royal birth   but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park   in the romulus mythology   signs of romulus  royal blood is brought by twelve vultures   while in the film   the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds   but of the carrion itself    whether or not romulus of  the caveman s valentine  will found a nation   or   in the case of novelist george dawes green   upon whose novel his own screenplay is based   a franchise   the fact remains that  the caveman s valentine  is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far    it   along with m   night shyamalan s  unbreakable    is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has   since miller s seminal   the dark knight returns     redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics    readers of sam keith s brilliant   the maxx   comic series   or of mtv s short lived animated adaptation of the same   are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne    the failure of both   the maxx   tv show and of  the caveman s valentine    not forgetting the initial backlash against  unbreakable    suggests that the public may not be ready for america s surprising contributions to dark fantasy    luxuriantly lit   brashly saturated   and comic panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent    death in venice   ca      while inhabiting robin standefer s    practical magic    mesmerizing sets    the caveman s valentine  is an unremittingly gorgeous film    kasi lemmons   following up her brilliant 1997 debut    eve s bayou    which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism   fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys   artists and suffering     the caveman s valentine  is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape    clearly not for every taste   when approached with the correct paradigm   it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year   a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post modern audience with urine stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes     the caveman s valentine  is a fine and a courageous film   crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot s rat s alley wasteland    
Neg, the happy bastard s quick movie review  the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid   really    shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control    sadly   that is the case with kingpin   a film directed by the farrelly brothers   the duo that brought us there s something about mary and dumb and dumber    since the duo directed and didn t write the script   i can assume that s part of the problem    the story seems good enough   a pro bowler in the 1970 s by the name of roy munson   woody harrelson   is sitting on top of the world    his popularity has gone through the roof and he s getting his career off the ground    then   however   he runs into ed mccracken   bill murray     a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for   well   anything    these two form an ill timed relationship that involves risky betting   and   before roy sees it coming   ed s abandoned him and he s about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine    forward seventeen years later   where roy has become quite the loser   complete with mechanical hand   torn up car   and   of course   the occasional knocking up of the ugly ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while    however   he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley   where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael   randy quaid     who has quite the bowling arm    with the kid s help   he figures he can be known again   particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno   nevada    of course   the amish kid needs some coaxing   particularly when you consider   well   he s amish    this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film   such as roy s process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow    finally   the duo get on the road and   along the way   pick up an additional helper  a beautiful hustler   played by the gorgeous vanessa angel      the main problem i had with kingpin wasn t the fact it wasn t funny    in fact   it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it   such as the aformentioned above and roy s explanation of not having children   something involving a cheese grater        but that s just it  scenes    there s a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie   like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex boyfriend    i mean   was this really necessary    couldn t have this been handled just a bit wackier    i mean   this is a comedy   why throw ethics in    particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle   where hair gel can be easily mistaken    that really ruined it   however   and that s too bad    the acting is top notch   especially from angel and murray   and the really funny scenes are worth noting    still   if you re going to think dumb   think dumb all the way through   ok    at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i d still be a little bit irked    
Neg, there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of   scream queen   in the early  80s    two of them were halloween movies   but the other two    prom night and terror train    were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween    the same   god   i m scared   there s some guy in a mask coming after me   routine she did in john carpenter s classic   jamie lee copies here   with none of the urgency or suspense    terror train takes place on   where else     a train   charted by some pre med students finishing their first four years of higher education    most of them won t make it to med school   though   and it s obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains     i wish to hell they d put a radio on that train      the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone   even jamie lee    from the beginning   he s talking his head off   he tells one of his co workers   think on this    when s the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station      as if it makes any kind of sense   and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles    of course   the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body   which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it    i forgot to mention the prologue    it s a party three years earlier   with the same group of students    two of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge   promising him he s going to get laid    they send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in   noticing a form on the bed    she says     kiss me   kenny     and he kisses the body on the bed   which happens to be a cadaver         oh my god   they killed kenny !  you bastards !      it s a sick trick   and one jamie lee wasn t let in on    she still hasn t forgiven the guy as they board the terror train     you asshole   you can t have a good time without hurting somebody !        the killing starts before the train even leaves the station    since it s new year s   everyone s wearing disguises   a convenient plot device we ve seen before     and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no one s looking    at least one of the characters says it s a groucho mask   when the killer dons it and steps aboard   it looks like gene shalit who   by the way   would make a great killer in a slasher movie    speaking of weird looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene   one of terror train s most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield   as the magician     who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music    then there s his greatest trick    getting laid with hair that looks like that    for all its attempts at visual style and substance   terror train is more lionel than amtrak   more prom night than halloween   and nothing really worth watching    only die hard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield   if he truly has any fans   should even attempt to watch it    and it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse    i mean   when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station   anyway    terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car    
Pos, you ve heard all the hype    you ve seen all their faces   natalie portman   the professional   as queen amidala   liam neeson   schindler s list   as qui gon jinn   ewan mcgregor   trainspotting   as obi wan kenobi   and jake lloyd   jingle all the way   as young anakin skywalker    if you ve read any reviews   you ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy    you also may have heard that this one s too kiddie friendly   and doesn t have enough content for adults    believe the hype    the effects are stunning   the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic   the lightsaber duels are amazing   and queen amidala s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth    but there s something missing here   and it isn t budget or effects   it s everything money * can t * buy    the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad stroked and flat characters    the most successful at this is liam neeson who   as qui gon jinn   a jedi master to young obi wan kenobi   has quiet dignity and a wise   commanding presence    he is the anchor to this movie   as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out    portman s queen amidala and mcgregor s obi wan kenobi don t fare nearly so well    amidala   the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation     !       comes off as stoic   stilted and caricatured   it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life      and obi wan   although mcgregor makes him very endearing   has so little screen time that he s nothing but a robin to qui gon jinn s batman    however   mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity   and he does a good job    he also absolutely nails alec guiness    obi wan in episode 4   6   scottish accent   and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise    in fact   lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit   and that s one of the problems with this film    i would never call myself a   star wars   fan   especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days   but i ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america    however   if you are the one person in america who * hasn t * seen the films at all or even recently   or who doesn t bother to brush up on the names of obscure characters   you may be hopelessly lost    for example   one of the film s main   nefarious   characters is senator palpatine    for those of you not recently steeped in   star wars   trivia   emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader s master in   return of the jedi   and   empire strikes back      so   obviously   his appearance in   phantom menace   is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series   thus making his role here more meaningful    a lot of the movie is like that    r2 d2 and c 3po make token appearances   and it s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience s pre existing fondness for them        because he doesn t do much to add to it in any way    same goes for jabba the hutt   who doesn t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy    even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film   tatooine   the desert world where luke grew up     coruscant   the cloud city from   empire strikes back       and alderaan   leia s home planet   which we never actually see   that gets blown up in   star wars     show up or are mentioned briefly in passing    what s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films    the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty    there s no meat   no substance   that makes you want to love the characters as they are   not as they will be    another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film    i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters   strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters   had mouths that barely moved   making them look more like muppets than actual characters    and jar jar binks   a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character   is intended as comic relief   but what he really becomes is annoying   and fast    unlike chewbacca and c 3po   who got their humanity   if you ll pardon the expression   from their interactions with the human characters   jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind   at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive   teenage mutant ninja turtles      furthermore   the dialogue is often stilted and corny   and sometimes downright infantile   thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot    oddly   this isn t just * my * judgment   lucas has said that he designed this film for kids    well   he s done a good job    the hero of this film   of course   is young anakin   but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight year old boy    that s not jake lloyd s fault   though   he does a good job of being a cute kid   which is apparently all lucas asked of him    that s another mistake   of course   because the cute tyke becomes darth vader    warning   spoilers ahead ! ! ! !  in my opinion   there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin s future evil in the film    the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks   and there s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie    he has a doting mother   pernilla august   making her first english  language film   and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine    but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn t all hearts and roses is yoda s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui gon jinn    his explanation       his future is clouded         warning   major spoiler ahead    enter at your own risk      of course   the noble qui gon dies at the hand of darth maul   a scary looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts   but has turned to the dark side    this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie   but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double sided lightsaber   and his scary facial makeup    because qui gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force   obi wan   qui gon s young padawan apprentice   one level below knightdom     must take over the training himself    so   at the end of the movie   we end where the saga actually begins   with obi wan kenobi and his young apprentice   anakin   darth vader   skywalker    did this story need to be told    i would say no    but is it a worthwhile movie to see    absolutely    if you don t enter the theater with jedi size expectations   and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle   then this is your movie    the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation    the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight    and yoda and young obi wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler   happier time    above all   this is a fun movie    not deep   not meaningful   and not profound    but fun    maybe next time   lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co write the script   and the guy who directed   empire   will direct    because if lucas does the next one himself   it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most   potential

Neg, by the time dennis quaid   the ostensible star of switchback   makes his first appearance at about the 22 minute mark   you may find yourself wondering why he bothered    after all   writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines    the first finds amarillo   texas sheriff buck olmstead   r   lee ermey   facing a hotly contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction    as olmstead begins his investigation   we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects    lane dixon   jared leto   is an enigmatic young hitchhiker   bob goodall   danny glover   is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination    all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place    the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work   and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other s protagonist    but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse    lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years    he s not supposed to be tracking him any more    according to the bureau   they ve got their man    but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise    two months earlier   lacrosse s own son was kidnapped by the killer   and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere    lacrosse knows his killer s work   and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game    it wouldn t be fair to reduce everything that s wrong with switchback to quaid s presence   but it s a pretty good place to start    there s a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center   as a dramatic actor   dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation    we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight jawed   sourpuss pucker   we can tell he s grim because every word comes out in an eastwood esque rasp    a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character   pulling the audience into his haunted intensity   making switchback  his  film    quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated    it s tough to become emotionally invested in a character s turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes    even without quaid   it doesn t appear that switchback would have stayed on course    the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy   building our curiosity over which man    the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor    is the real threat    unfortunately   stuart tips his hand far too early in the game   both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal    once the mystery of the killer s identity is dispatched   the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable    in fact     stale and predictable   describes the direction that switchback takes in general   falling back on far too common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere   a climactic fistfight on board a freight train   and edgy law enforcement agents    it s too bad stuart wasn t willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead   far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film    played with atypical restraint by r   lee ermey   he s a wonderful   unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions    a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story telling    instead   stuart places his trust in a   name   star who can t carry the material    maybe next time he ll throw away that one crucial page in the script   the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story    
Pos, errol morris   critically acclaimed director of the 1997 documentary fast   cheap and out of control   vaults to new heights with mr    death    this film   an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred a   leuchter   jr     is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise   stunning even the more jaded minds among us    don t let the film s cheesy dissuade you    following this sideshow of horror lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter s life and mind    morris follows the trail of leuchter s madness with appalling lucidity   revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with   this leuchter guy is seriously messed up    virtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls   leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession   designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries   in spite of his lack of credentials    after a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows   leuchter came to the attention of neo nazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel   who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his `theory  that the holocaust never happened    morris s interviews are surprisingly congenial   drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves    zundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch    leuchter seems completely at ease   sometimes jovial    part of this effect may be due to morris s new interviewing machine   called the interrotron   which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer    this was the first time morris had used the device   and the results are startling    combine the irony of these interviews with leuchter s reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau   not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant   and you ve got one compelling and disturbing documentary    while this film isn t for the feeble minded or weak hearted   it is a valuable addition to the cultural landscape    aside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece   morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject and i   for one   feel bettered by the experience    
Pos, expectation rating   a bit worse than expected   mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull      roger ebert gave it a four star review   and while he is a critic that uses the full scale   and i often agree    such as dark city being the best film of 1998   he must have seen a better film    i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it    the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter    the landscape is snowy and cold   and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner   which also reminds me of fargo   which i loathed        one can almost sense the cold    but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead   instead raimi has made a more constrained film    which probably is for the better    this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots    the movie also reminded me of affliction   as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father   and they see a chance for such a dream to come true    this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field   where an airplane has crash landed    in the plane three men find   the american dream        in a gym bag      affliction too was set in a snowy landscape    it really seems very simple    just hold on to the money until spring   and if no one claims it   they ll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true    but the snow melts   and so might several of the character s hopes    as in   return to paradise     some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing    but doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish    the movie s biggest strength is that it fact makes sense    i have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized   eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story    for example clear and present danger    the biggest problem seems to over familiarization with the story    the writer perhaps feels that he doesn t have to present scenes that are clear to him   but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book    this is definitely not the problem with a simple plan   even though the screenplay is by the book s author    the movie is always clear on where it s going   and always makes sense    i m sue a lot was cut   but really i can t remember what    even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included    the man only comes in on mondays   but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many    turns out        well   see the movie    one should be warned against seeing the trailer    it reveals several scenes from the ending moments   which yes   like in the book   it is a downer     several plot developments   and much of the beginning    but much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer   so if you re lucky   you ll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie    
Neg, i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year   when matthew perry had just signed on    i m big fan of perry s subtle sense of humor   and in addition   i think chris farley s on edge   extreme acting was a riot    so naturally   when the trailer for   almost heroes   hit theaters   i almost jumped up and down    a soda in hand   the lights dimming   i was ready to be blown away by farley s final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry s big breakthrough    i was ready to be just amazed   for this to be among farley s best   in spite of david spade s absence    i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran    sadly   none of this came to pass    the humor is spotty at best   with good moments and laughable one liners few and far between    perry and farley have no chemistry   the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade   for it s his type of humor   and not at all what perry is associated with    and the movie tries to be smart   a subject best left alone when it s a farley flick    the movie is a major dissapointment   with only a few scenes worth a first look   let alone a second    perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie   and not surprisingly   the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley    and farley s classic humor is widespread   too    almost heroes almost works   but misses the wagon train by quite a longshot    guys   let s leave the exploring to lewis and clark   huh    stick to   tommy boy     and we ll all be   friends      
Pos, in some respects   rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking    the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone    the cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble    all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element    the duo must always be completely mismatched    the hero has to say some smart assed comment before   and after   shooting someone    however   that doesn t necessarily make for a bad film    rush hour is jackie chan s first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector   1985      proving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets   ie   hong kong     jackie chan is given much more free reign than before    still   some die hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed   as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes   which he views as too short   according to one interview      this film takes a familiar theme of east meets west    jackie chan is lee   the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case   while chris tucker is carter   the loudmouthed   destructive cop that is `promoted  to the fbi to help him    or   at least   so he thinks   also another classic notion in action films   the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes      despite the necessary conventions of action films   rush hour is some of the most fun you ll spend and hour and forty minutes watching    jackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen   continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches    chris tucker   familiar from his whiny   annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable   complementing jackie chan s straight laced character    however   jackie chan still maintains his comic slapstick edge   as expected of him and his films    perfectly downplaying the `fish out of water  routine through his character s attempts at mixing into american culture   he makes up for the down time his character experiences    when he is in action   however   you ll be amused and dazzled    still being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up   in this case   a steering wheel   a serving tray   and a barstool     jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu    chris tucker s character may come across as irritating   yet is also humorous    since he s not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan   he uses his main weapon   his mouth   hence   the tagline   `fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west       while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare   it is appropriate for the film and still very funny    while not necessarily poignant   attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well    lee s `knowledge  of american pop culture   `that s the beach boys !      when contrasted against carter s lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick   while carter teaches lee hip hop dance moves    while rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4   known in north america as supercop and jackie chan s first strike   respectively     it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr   nice guy    with its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs   it makes for a fun film    as well   it is a true departure from jackie chan films   as it is missing one common element   a whiny female co star    
Neg, isn t it the ultimate sign of a movie s cinematic ineptitude when you can t think of much to say about it other than   it sucks      one of the first official year 2000 releases   supernova is such a movie    i can t seem to get past one word adjectives with this one   although   boring       stupid   and   absurd   doesn t amount to much of a review    a shame    i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate    but c est la vie    here goes nothing    i ll keep it short    i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill   48 hours   removed his name from the movie   requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee    the film s fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press   an event usually signifying a studio s lack of confidence in a particular movie    hill s and mgm s actions were prudent    when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident   a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer   for some reason   james spader   is forced to take command    the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and   on arrival   picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony    one of the crew members   angela bassett   knows this passenger   who is played by peter facinelli   and has some bad feelings about it    and we all know what that means    this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo    a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown   though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it    another one of the crew members experiences this first hand   after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo   he does some impressive handstand pushups    evidently   touching this enigmatic egg shaped thingie makes you younger and stronger    how    why    the movie never bothers to explain    soon enough though   spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad   being chased by the all of a sudden superhuman facinelli    to be honest   i don t even remember exactly why    i just remember that i didn t care    supernova s plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas   such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb   but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing    in fact   everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set    well   the effects are good   though there s hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so i m not sure whether that s so remarkable an accomplishment    the performances are hardly worth talking about    i m not even sure i can call what s here   performances     though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger    james spader is not a bad actor   but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars i ve seen in a while   mostly because he isn t given a character with a personality    the action scenes are just as bland   since they re pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren t particularly entertaining the first time around    and since the action scenes are everything to this movie   it s pretty much dead in the water    and for the life of me   i can t figure out why it s called supernova    
Pos, matthew broderick and high school comedy    the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986    now it is 13 years later   and broderick has another high school comedy   election   to show the world    ferris buehler s day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows    it was light   fluffy   tasty   and sparkling clean    but election is far different    this production is a dark   and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies   it shocks as well    jim mcallister   matthew broderick   is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud    he is a kind   caring   younger man who has built his life around carver high school    in turn   carver high school has provided a home for him    jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span   and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body    tracy flick   reese witherspoon   is an intelligent   outgoing   and   to quote the film     super nice   young girl    she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities   always has her hand up first in class   and is extremely popular among most of the student body    so   it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president    the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one    the father   dick   holmes osborne     owns a cement company    the mother   jo   jeanine jackson     is an ideal housewife    and the two children   paul   chris klein   and tammy   jessica campbell     are both students at carver high school    paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself   and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school    tammy is a lesbian who   to say the least   is going through a period of self discovery    for reasons of revenge   hatred   and sexual envy   jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president    he claims that in a democracy you need choices   and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts    so paul agrees and the race is on    but then   in an effort to spite the two candidates   tammy announces that she is running as well    her campaign is straightforward   people only run to put it on their college applications   then they do nothing    well     i don t even want to go to college     she says    in election   there are no   good guys      almost everyone has their own agenda    no matter how deeply hidden   the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience    tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school    she is the girl that would be labeled   most likely to achieve anything she wants   in the yearbook   and everyone secretly envied her because of that    jim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege   and uses it to his own amoral advantage    everyone   including the principal   a former teacher   all the candidates   and even paul s girlfriend are two sided characters    that is much of this film s beauty   it doesn t have the typical good guys that hollywood likes   instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world   specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves    matthew broderick couldn t have been any more perfect for this role    his character is often similar bill murray s award winning role in the 1998 film   rushmore    of the two acting jobs   broderick s is far superior    but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon    the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her   is simply indescribable    broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes    one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day    you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures   making her an eligible candidate    and his subtle disgust with her is apparent   although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face    the supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience    but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part    however   the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl    this is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so called platform for presidency    she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed    if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools   and gave you an innocent laugh or two   then the movie achieved its goal    but don t you dare think that election s goals are similar    it is just as real in its portrayal of high school   as its characters are in the real world    there certainly is no pile of marshmallows here    
Pos, naturally   at the core of leon gast s   when we were kings   is the fight itself   for what a fight it was    thanks to the business savvy of don king   an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman    fans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy   as much as brute strength   that immediately entered boxing lore    with the benefit of the first hand recollections of that old ex pug norman mailer   this classic conflict is brought back to life    but   when we were kings   tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match    questions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary    gast could hardly choose otherwise   considering the vocal   uncompromising politics of muhammad ali    a member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam   ali opens gast s film with a forceful swipe at the united states    when ali hollers   damn america    the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt   the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind    his decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury     no viet cong ever called me nigger     ali reasons    despite showcasing ali s proud unequivocal politics   one of the most impressive features of   when we were kings   is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion    listening to the film s numerous commentators   it is clear that the geographic location for this   rumble in the jungle   is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map    spike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage   a   coming home   to africa    foreman reminds us that africa is the   cradle of civilisation      fair enough   but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality    it is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu   a brutal dictator    while ali respects mobutu s ability to forge an independent african state   mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well stocked torture chambers    mailer s insights are lost on most of the film s commentators    george plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo   rather than the newly christened zaire    with admirable restraint   gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire  s squalid ruling elite    mobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power    don king   resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the   messiah   label attributed to him by a loyal disciple   passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity    understandably   foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal    he may be   as one sympathiser notes     blacker   than ali   but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali   the thuggish mobutu   and the tacky huckster don king    africa   zaire   inspirational leader or vicious dictator   all is left undifferentiated   unconsidered   in this optimistic celebration of black unity    little wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that ali s opponent wasn t white    admittedly   these issues are only hinted at   rather than substantially explored    the audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves   in their own time    there is just too much to cover   too much that is truly worthy of celebration   for a protracted political analysis to be justified    the excitement of james brown and b   b king in concert   for instance    and of course there s always ali to consider   as he shamelessly   and hilariously   hams it up in front of the camera   shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another     we gonna get it on coz we don t get along !      doubtlessly   considering the multi faceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover   the makers of   when we were kings   faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues   and what personalities   best deserved their attention    fortunately   by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter   they have captured the richness and excitement of this unique event    
Pos, note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    east meets west in mulan   the latest installment in disney s parade of annual animated feature films    an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass market commercial sensibilities   this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years   but falls short of actualizing its potential    though not for lack of trying    in many respects   mulan is among disney s most mature efforts   skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat    the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized    the imagery of a pillaged village   neatly encapsulated in the form of a child s discarded doll   is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars   and mulan s later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy   bloodless method imaginable    yet how often does a hollywood animated film   long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent   dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner    in an instant   idealistic mulan s innocence is lost   and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending    the film   based upon an ancient chinese fable   centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family s obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns   cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones   replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger edged teeth   although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace      dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades   disney s new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere   story intact   to some neutral territory   and revels in its east asian roots   aside from a predominantly asian american cast providing the film s vocal work   there s liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout   and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence    while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes    invoking pseudo asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary   and i can t imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate chopping blocks of stone in two    it s rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory    the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset   although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately   it s startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan s land    at its core   the film is a tale of heroic adventure   and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour   perseverance   nobility and courage    as such   animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic   where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand in hand with visual purity    scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action   such as mulan s venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice   are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation    mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments   particularly during our heroine s character defining opening half hour    it s when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation    the friendly animal sidekick   the colourful array of supporting characters    into the mix where it goes slightly awry    off to battle   mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little   lucky   cricket   who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience friendly comic relief    they re affable presences   and not precisely ineffective    reasonable amounts of humour are elicited   and eddie murphy   who voices mushu   is amusingly earnest    but amidst all the high melodrama   the effect is mildly jarring and   from a storytelling perspective   questionable in its necessity    at training camp   mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits   easily characterized simply as the short clown   the skinny clown   and the big clown     who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness   and   in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns   she grows a certain fondness for a handsome   square jawed young captain   shang    everybody needs love   even ancient chinese warrior princesses   but not necessarily in * this * film    the romantic angle   which lets the air out of the sails of the story s neo feminist underpinnings   lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation    another staple of recent disney animated films   a cache of hummable little ditties   has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness    composed by matthew wilder   none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing   and one      i ll make a man out of you     unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines      becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable    only   reflections     an early ballad of lament   proves to be a song of any consequence   serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga   one of musical theatre s most wondrously pure voices    nonetheless   mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory   with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork   the computer generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive    while the blatantly child friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film   they re not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable    briskly paced with a smart   energetic heroine and filled with high adventure   the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter    
Pos, on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements   in case you missed it   warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail    he says to a black congregation         if you can t cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife   you re never gonna get rid of me        well   there is such a plot   and it works very well in this comedy    beatty plays jay billington bulworth   a long time democratic senator from california    the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth s latest commercials condemning affirmative action    the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy    when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv   having gone without food or sleep for days    his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care    first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe   a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter s name    then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination    his assistant murphy   oliver platt   is oblivious to bulworth s suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements    bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african american church   then takes questions from the audience    he is hit hard with questions about his voting record    he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots   and it hasn t shown up    since he s a dead man anyway   he figures he ll answer truthfully   he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l   a   for the photo opportunity    they made some promises that improved their public image for a while   and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made    the shock and outrage from the congregation grows   the questions keep coming   and he keeps shooting back honest   if ugly   answers       before i go further   i d like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make   and that is that characterizing african americans as malt liquor drinking o   j    fans is not part of bulworth s   truth      that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie    when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics   this line is not what they re talking about      the experience is liberating    with nothing left to lose   bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth    he can say whatever he wants because he s going to be dead anyway    why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician   that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists   and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism    bulworth s candor wins him three volunteers from the church   one of whom   nikki   halle barry     he gets a crush on    he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something    chicken wings   appropriately enough    bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives    when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings   bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment    with so much money and so many talented people working so hard   he wonders   why can t hollywood make a quality product       you go   warren !    when they become indignant and ask why he s talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product   he callously admits that it s because they are rich jews    that night he drops the three african american volunteers at their nightclub   and he decides to go in with them    he stays up all night drinking   smoking pot   dancing   falling in love with nikki   and learning to scratch turntables and rap    the next day   he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit and tie fundraisers    from then on   at all of his political appearances   he raps his political truth    his rap is not bad for a middle aged white guy    he s not very good   but it is his first try and at least he s not embarrassingly bad    his lobbyists are not amused   but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth    eventually   the movie s plot   remember he hired a hit man      overtakes the politics   which is too bad    screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him    there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes   bulworth fleeing his killer    these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along   but it distracted and detracted from bulworth s political ranting   which was much more interesting than the ever present   obvious looking assassin    still   most of the movie is original and very enjoyable   and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen    as the story and screen writer   he came up first with a good structure   then with good dialogue to back it up   jeremy pikser co wrote the screenplay      as an actor   he was able to convincingly portray bulworth s depression   then liberation and rebirth    as a producer   there were four others   he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood s indulgent formulas   except for those inexcusable chase scenes      someone else probably could have directed   but since he was there anyway   what the heck    it s too bad that there aren t more movies like this around   movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics    after all   much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news    just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants    just don t expect to be popular with the insurance companies    
Neg, one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean luc godard film    after all   he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave    he is also an esteemed film critic   lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing    however   his latest creation   in praise of love   is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year    the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit   to dissect love into the following four categories   meeting   physical passion   quarrels   and reconciliation    these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples   young   adult   and elderly    it is edgar s   bruno putzulu   self appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup   to define a central idea     it s only when things are over that they make sense      whether this project will end up a play   film   or opera remains undecided    the thesis is simple enough that   if played right   it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone    instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes   the next scene no more engaging than the last    only once does any character utter something worthwhile   but by the time it happens you re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it    but don t fret   it will surface again    you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film   as some fellow critics did   and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in   not having missed anything worthwhile    but you hold hope for some time    the background music keeps you in a state of urgency   and even suspense   for the first few conversations    it s only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope    and with speeches like     i am thinking of something   but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else     how can you expect to hold anyone s interest    to godard s credit   he certainly knows how to frame a scene    the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful    watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him    and if this film had anything poignant to say   you would have   which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities    the environments   be it city or country   are impeccably captured in crisp detail   but the script never complements them    unfortunately   godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene    sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings   but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words    the second half is composed of nauseating hyper color that often blurs the image    you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners    the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies    steven spielberg is picked on in particular    while i ll grant that this does happen   and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage   it s still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood    it just goes to show   an intelligent person isn t necessarily an admirable storyteller    the days of breathless are no more    
Pos, plot   this movie takes place over one day    it s a rookie cop s narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran    the rookie doesn t know much about   street justice     so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the   real world      how even cops like themselves have to   bend the rules   and   break the law   every now and then   in order to catch the really bad guys    critique   a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board   some ups   some downs and a thrilling ending   despite a couple of small flaws    i really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place    the film gets right into the   dirty   side of   well       the  dirt on the streets   and proceeds to teach the rookie cop   and us   the audience   how things really work down there    of course   we re receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time   but the things he seems to be doing aren t exactly on the up and up either    and therein   lies the fun of the film    do you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones    well   as the film moves along   we re given two points of view in respect to this predicament   and to me   both sides made sense at some point or another    and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that   the director   who builds the film up wonderfully   with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script   and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades    hawke   first off   because he rarely plays these   commercial   roles but does so perfectly here   with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top    and denzel   well   what can you say about mr   washington that hasn t already been said before    he comes through as per his usual high level style here   and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent   of which   i personally would like to see more    he s nice   he s not so nice   he s smart   he s not so smart   he s caring and he s a dog all the way    the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point   okay   we get it       you  have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people       move on   and this one really major   coincidence   which involved a bathtub   that saved the day for one character   but seemed a little too   convenient   for my taste    i also never really understood how washington s character got out of a certain dire predicament   only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene    but obviously these small flaws didn t taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama   a film that gets you right into the streets   into the nooks and the crannies   and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the day to day drug busts    see it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself   see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on screen   and see it if you like holding on to your seat handles real tight during a movie    in fact   see it for the scene in which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gang bangers alone       dang   now that s intense !  where s joblo coming from    the corruptor   7/10     crimson tide   9/10     l   a   confidential   /10     lethal weapon   8/10     requiem for a dream   8/10     seven   10/10     shaft   7/10     traffic   8/10

Pos, quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie    he runs into the last dragon in existence   and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth   but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain    eventually   they decide to call a truce   and they work out a deal    since he is the last dragon   he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it    their scam works at first   until they come to a town without any money    instead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon   but of course   draco is a nice droagon   so he won t eat her   there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl    of course   as you can probably tell by the plot   this is a silly movie   but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times   unlike eddie   which was serious all the time    you could probably call this a medieval comedy   because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined    dennis quaid makes a fine hero    pete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them    dina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl    but lets face it   the movie is really about the dragon   and what an amazing creation he is    connery s voice and ilm team up to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon    so   if you are going to see this movie for a strong hard core medieval epic   you are going to the wrong movie    if you are going because of the dragon   you will not be dissapointed   and you will be provided with plenty of laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the script

Neg, synopsis   al simmons   top notch assasin with a guilty conscience   dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell    making a pact with malebolgia   a chief demon there   simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn   a general in hell s army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives   chains   and a morphing cape    sullen   wise cogliostro and flatulating   wisecracking violator vy for spawn s attention    comments   when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics   where he had made a name for himself as a first rate comic book penciller on the   spider man   titles   to join the newly formed   creator owned image comics   a new comic book legend was born   spawn    mcfarlane s   spawn   immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s    mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate   allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max    the early   spawn   issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane s genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing    with the popularity of   spawn   and the success of the current warner bros    s batman film franchise   a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn    in the summer of 1997   hence   new line cinema released spawn   a live action film based on the groundbreaking series    this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book   like me   numbed by how much spawn misses the mark    what happened    why is spawn so bad    todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo    i don t think   however   that his presence necessarily hurt   or helped   the film    i place the blame   in part   on the recent hollywood trend   fueled by public demand apparently   for special effects blow out movies utilizing the latest computer technology    these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else   character   plot   dialogue   etc   spawn   reflecting this trend   shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics    hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires   explosions   knives and chains appearing out of nowhere   glowing eyes   or constantly transforming demons    a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid   don t get me wrong   but   because the script and cast aren t engaging   spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper   the surface may capture the eye   but nothing exists underneath      spawn s translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level    mcfarlane s spawn was a tortured hero    a mercenary by trade   al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda    having died and journeyed to hell   he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda    simmons   however   discovers that his memories are fragmented   his body a creepy mess   and his wife married    despite his sometimes violent nature   readers couldn t help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld    spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so    when the characters are developed   they seem absurd rather than touching    the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot   a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat 16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world   do not help matters    spawn   in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman   also unwisely spends too much time on a villain   the violator   batman favored the joker over batman      john leguizamo   like jack nicholson in batman   receives top billing in the cast as the violator   michael jai white   al simmons / spawn   is second    i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator    the film   however   spends so much time on the violator s offensive antics that they grate on the nerves    apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film   as nicholson was in batman     especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn   the violator s lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny   leaving the audience wishing he would leave    leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role   but he is seen far too often in the film    michael jai white   a relative newcomer to theatrical releases   seems to be an appealing actor   and he handles his role adequately   but we see little of him without various masks on    more time needed to be spent on white s character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings    a special note should be made about martin sheen as the over the top   obnoxious   evil general wynn    easily the hammiest performance in the movie   it s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much   after all   he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now    sheen s excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film    many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down    mtv style   jerky   in your face editing is one of them    flames   for example   roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting    cogliostro   unlikely wannabe guide for spawn   serves as a poor narrator for the film    he goofily tells the audience   at one point   that   how much of [spawn s] humanity is left remains to be seen     as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another    the music   finally   assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue    loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes    to be fair   however   marilyn manson s   long hard road out of hell   effectively compliments spawn s return to earth   while filter and the crystal method s     can t you   trip like i do   proves a surprisingly fitting theme song    for as good a comic book as it is     spawn   did not spawn a good movie    spawn   instead   suffers from too much pomp and circumstance   and too little plot and character development    it receives two stars for its technically well done special effects    many other films   though   have equal   if not superior   special effects and are much better    rated pg 13   spawn seems more violent than many r rated movies and probably wouldn t be appropriate for the very young

Pos, the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes   and the greedy trade federation has used it s armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo    we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo s ruler   the young queen amidala   natalie portman   to sign a treaty giving the federation control    however   the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui gon jinn   liam neeson   and obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor   as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade    no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi   and the first battle begins    it seems that for me and thousands of people like me   the love for george lucas s trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time    we re the fans   not the freaks    we won t go dressing up like darth vader   although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool     and we won t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations   not all the time   anyway     but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest   we re throwing down    all right   stop looking at me like that    we have been faithfully and patiently waiting    waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll    you see   the trilogy is not just a set of movies   but a religion of sorts to we   the faithful disciples   and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah    unfortunately   it is not our savior    for weeks beforehand   i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good   stupendously good   miraculously good    anything less and it ll be the biggest disappointment of the century    i didn t want the doomsaying prophecy to come true   really i didn t   but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking    character development is virtually nonexistent    with the possible exception of qui gon   most of the film s characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions    none seem very affected by their experiences   and few even show any passion at all    contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks   a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo   in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala    jar jar s life is saved by qui gon early in the film   and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh   or supposedly so      his speech mannerisms are so   cute ified   that i couldn t understand a third of what he was saying   and the slapstick he performed was just distracting    his head gets caught in an electronic field   his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast   he describes being in trouble as   deep doo doo     and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport    therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors    in star wars   we had obi wan telling us mos eisley was a   wretched hive of scum and villainy      in the phantom menace   we get doo doo    the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story   a long time ago in a galaxy far   far away            this film   on the other hand   constantly reminds me that it s only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience    perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition   it s kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses     and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500 like play by play    i liked the pod race   it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension   but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters    the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction    this aspect   coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me    i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer   but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all    didn t millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again    didn t the action figures still sell like hotcakes    of course they did   and it s only poor judgment that allows the most eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults    one aspect that will appeal broadly   however   is the use of special effects    the people at lucas s industrial light and magic   the world s premiere effects house   outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer generated images and real life footage    some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed   especially the shots of a land battle between the federation s robot army and jar jar s countrymen    the space battles are also impressive   although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer    this   however   is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today    john williams is back   of course   providing a score for the film as only he can    his music is pervasive throughout   as rousing and as dramatic as ever   always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately    since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine episode story   star wars   the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four   five and six   respectively     the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already   in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar    as a result   attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin    it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi wan   for example   but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover   it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films    one of the new characters is darth maul   hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film s release    in spite of the hype   darth maul is a character which almost didn t have to be in the film   his role is so insignificant    he has maybe three spoken lines   believe it or not   a second actor voices the character   and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean    with that working against him   he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment    lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe   something which has been prominent throughout    however   he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible   offering an easy out for story writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real life connection    oddly   while trying to capitalize on spirituality   lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force loving parasites in your body s cells    this only serves to de mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection    don t let me mislead you too far    the phantom menace   by most standards   is a good film    it contains a lot of visual treats   sets the stage for an epic story   gives us a bit of excitement here and there   and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends    it s just that when held up to it s predecessors   and to not do so would be unrealistic     this film simply pales    
Pos, the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be   in some ways    in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint   and its series sequel the return of the saint   val kilmer plays simon templar   an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others    this movie closely resembles a james bond flick    it has the classic bond symbols   a man who can do just about anything and get away with it   a woman whom the man persues   a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal    kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie   although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations    the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests    as a young boy   kilmer s character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork    that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name   that of a catholic saint    he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be    this leads to a devestating mistake   which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life    kilmer s first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak   played by rade serbedzija    during a press conference   he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area   avoiding guards   cameras   and many other potential obstacles    once his mission is completed and he is safely home   the fee is paid    when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million   he decides to carry out only one more mission   then retire    dr   emma russell   portrayed by elisabeth shue   has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion    this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia   where millions are without heat and are freezing to death    the only problem is   tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people    this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal    tretiak hires him to steal the equations   small pieces of paper   from shue    one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions    they are very convincing   not only to the characters in the movie   but to us    kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue s character into getting to know him even more   which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula    when the two meet   and end up having a sensual experience   kilmer s character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell   as she is falling in love with kilmer s alter ego   a traveling artist    yet   he must reach his goal of $50 million   which requires him to steal the energy formula   putting his feelings aside    shue s character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces   the names of the catholic saints   together   something no one else is able to do    when she finds him   they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak    the saint is very action packed   with few slow points    the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments    along the course of the movie   there are even a few   although brief moments of comedy    these moments are almost always thanks to kilmer s extraneous   very convincing disguises and personalities    all in all   a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non stop action    
Pos, today   war became a reality to me after seeing a screening of saving priivate ryan    steve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production    the audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing the horror of war    please keep the kids home as the r rating is for reality    tom hanks is stunning as capt john miller   set out in france during ww ii to rescue and return home a soldier   private ryan   matt damon   who lost three brothers in the war    spielberg at time takes us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes    private ryan is not for everyone   but i felt the time was right for a movie like this to be made    the movie reminds us of the sacrifices made by our ww ii fighting men and women    we must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice   their lives so that we may live in freedom today    for this i thank them and for steve spielberg for making a movie that i will never forget    the academy will not forget tom hanks come april 1999   as another well deserved oscar with be in tom s posession    
Pos, true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head on   which is probably why so few of them do it    even the most religious directors   like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman   usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms    so it s not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get   the apostle   onto the big screen    as a matter of fact   even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing   and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money    he also wrote the script   directed the film   and starred as the central character   a fiery texas preacher named euliss   sonny   dewey    few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial   technical   and creative responsibility single handedly   and it s testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall    and   thankfully   every bit of that personal investment translates on screen into power and honest emotion    sonny is an energetic   pentecostal preacher who has been speaking   actually shouting   from behind the pulpit since he was twelve    he spends much of his time traveling about the country   evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals    unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers   sonny is not a phony or a swindler   and the film s purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church    duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says   although like all humans   he has weaknesses    one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that   not only does his long suffering wife   jessie   farrah fawcett     want to leave him for another man in the congregation   but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher    faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately  his church and his family   that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper    at his son s baseball game   sonny snaps and smashes his wife s lover in the face with a baseball bat   inflicting a wound that may be fatal    not knowing what else to do   sonny disappears    he throws away his identification   drives his car into a lake   and takes a bus to louisiana   hoping to start over again    in the tiny   mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte   sonny once again finds his calling    after befriending a simple auto mechanic   walt goggins   and tracking down the town s ex minister   john beasley     sonny sets up his own church   the one way to heaven temple    re christening himself as   the apostle e   f       he quickly draws together an eager congregation   and together they realize real change in each other s lives    but   always   sonny s past is lurking a step behind him   waiting to swallow his progress    duvall has made his intentions in making   the apostle   clear    in a recent article in   newsweek     he wrote     filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit   and when they do   it tends to be patronizing   full of charlatans and snake handlers        but what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe   and to portray it in an accurate way      the strength of duvall s convictions turn out to be the strength of his film     the apostle   always rings true   even in the most painful moments   because we know he s being sincere with the subject matter    after fifteen years of traveling the country   listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said   duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual    his sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to       i ve always called you jesus and you ve always called me sonny     he says    when neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs   sonny s mother   june carter cash   just hangs up on them because she knows there s no sense trying to interrupt him    the main theme to emerge from   the apostle   is the fact that good can come from any situation    sonny s act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing   and duvall never shrinks from that fact    however   that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte   where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him    in his short time in louisiana   he does a world of good   and when the police finally show up to take him away   he goes quietly   knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him    and   as a scene during the final credits shows   he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment    it is that strength in sonny s character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others   he is flawed   but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws    weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves    watching duvall on screen   it s not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting    as sonny   he completely inhabits the character   and his performance is certainly the best of the year    because he spent so much time absorbing the traits   methods   quirks   and personalities of real preachers   duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human    as a director   duvall feels that less is more    his camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it   with very little intrusion    there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close ups    duvall knew that the power of the film s characters   enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non professional churchgoers and actual ministers   didn t need to be artificially enhanced    in this way     the apostle   almost plays out like a documentary   not only in its technical simplicity   but more importantly   in its sense of reality    
Neg, what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in real life    you get martin lawrence in a coma   the comedian thought he was getting fat   so he put on numerous layers of heavy clothing and went jogging in 100 degree heat   ending up in a coma      so what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in the movies    you get an audience in a coma    in big momma s house   lawrence plays a fbi agent who s a master of disguises    when a naughty   naughty man escapes from jail and seeks out his former girlfriend   the very sexy nia long        the only thing worth looking at in this movie     she flees to georgia to stay with her rather large southern aunt   big momma     ella mitchell      the fbi follows her in order to recover the large sum of money stolen in the bank robbery that sent the naughty man to jail    however   big momma is called away on an emergency    sensing that they could lose their only chance to capture the criminal   lawrence goes undercover as big momma    and let the comedy begin !  big momma s house is the definition of a   gimmick   movie if there ever was one    the plot can basically be summed up as   martin lawrence dresses up as a fat woman          and even that description is too wordy    you can just see this script plotted out on a chalkboard with martin lawrence/fat woman in the middle of the board with a big circle around it   and all sorts of clich   d     humorous   situations pointing to it    fat woman plays basketball !  fat woman takes a dump !  fat woman kung fu !  well they left one off the board        movie critic slips into coma !  paul giamatti   private parts   the negotiator   plays lawrence s partner and as much as i enjoy his work   even he can t inject life into this lifeless comedy    hell   the greatest performers on the planet couldn t make this material work        it s just that awful    
Pos,    i d rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell     earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher    with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister   hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story    he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american   and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation    from elmer gantry on   we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church    well   think again   for the apostle   which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade   does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister   and by implication all   the rest of organized religion    instead it gives us a highly devout man   who certainly has his foibles   but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god    and arguably just as surprising   the good spirited film is no comedy   even if it does have humorous moments    instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures    when in the privacy of his attic   robert duvall   as texas preacher euliss   sonny   dewey   argues sternly with his lord   the scene shares a kinship with emily watson s character crying out for her god in breaking the waves s most powerful scene    the body of the story starts with sonny s coming upon an horrific auto accident   which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters    with his well worn bible in hand   sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident s dying victims    the scowling police officer orders him to go away   and   after he has tried to work his miracles   sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord s work    robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film s director   writer   executive producer   and chief financier    rarely has a movie been such a labor of love    with a white suit   peach colored shirt and tie   and dark sunglasses   sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher    duvall has every movement down pat    even when he is walking down the street   the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy    he dances and claps all the way    sonny s churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep voiced black orators   but his rhetoric is always competitive       i may be on the devil s hit list   but i m on god s mailing list     he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent    and they lap it up    people jump up   scream     praise the lord !    and mean it    the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable    but sonny is no saint    it turns out that he has a wandering eye   which angers his wife jessie   played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett    jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church s youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny s church   leaving him unemployed    sonny   letting his temper get the best of him   does something foolish   which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever    the bulk of the film occurs in a small   predominately black church in louisiana   which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church     one way road to heaven   holiness temple     with an enthusiastic flock    in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e   f   the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church    he asks his members to tithe   but he gives all of his money    and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks    a man who can t stand to be still   he tells one of his friends     i quit school because i didn t like recess      in his new town he meets toosie   miranda richardson     who   like him   has a family that she hasn t seen in a while    his romance with the separated woman   like the rest of the film   doesn t follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies    billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker    his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show s many surprising scenes   again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take    although it probably couldn t have ended any other way   the movie does wrap things up nicely    and don t miss the sweet epilogue during the film s closing credits    a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film    the apostle runs a little too long at 2   12    it is rated pg 13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up    
Neg,    the world on land    it s just too big for me      starring tim roth   pruitt taylor vince   bill nunn   clarence williams iii    rated r    the legend of 1900s is the year s most absurd movie   a rambling   nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast    it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth   looking wistful as ever   as a guy named        1900    you heard right    his name is   in all actuality   1900    he was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900   uh   hence the name     abandoned and adopted by danny   a ship crewman    1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny s fear that he might be taken away from him because of   visa matters      well   when 1900 is about 9 or so   he starts wondering all around the ship    one day   he discovers a grand piano    he sits down and starts playing    miraculously   what comes out is beautiful    a group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age    when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is   totally against regulations   1900 replies   f * ck the regulations !    ho ho ho    1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land    when he s about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody s business   onboard comes another musician    his name is max   pruitt taylor vince   and he plays the trumpet    after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm   he sits him down on the piano next to him   takes the piano s braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall   taking them with it    how the chair they re sitting on and the piano don t separate   i don t know   but this apparently isn t the kind of thing we re supposed to ask    after that   1900 and max become friends    max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land   but 1900 has no intention of doing so    what s more   he doesn t even want his music to go anywhere without him   when a record company hears about his talents   they come on board to make a record of his music   but after finding out that    gasp !     they re going to make millions of copies   he breaks the record    the conflict of the movie is that after max   unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship   gets off himself   he stumbles upon a record of 1900 s music in a store    the record shouldn t exist because a   1900 never stepped on dry land and b   the one record that was made on the ship was broken    ladies and gentlemen   it s a mystery !  the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements    we re supposed to be roused by a climactic        piano duel    there isn t anything in this movie with the potential to compel    1900 comes off as a whiny   brooding   extremely unlikable man   i can t recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo  meditation on life    ditto for max   who doesn t seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900    tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf   there s no spirit   no gusto to the character    he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship   but to us he is dead    pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable   at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit    the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant   leering   king of jazz   who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel    the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore   whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many    this effort is utterly limp and lifeless    at once ridiculous   boring   narrow sighted and pointless   this is one movie that should be    and will be    quickly forgotten    
Pos, aliens ! ! well   that is what this movie is about    computer generated aliens    ok   the movie is not just about computer generated aliens    it s about computer generated aliens and a secret organization known as mib    if one wasn t green and running around the other would not exist as it s known    the computer graphics in this movie are spectacular   they make you want to believe that aliens like the ones depicted exits    since seeing this movie i have to agree concede that denis rodman is an alien   he simply has to be    well   in all seriousness the aliens created here are not only of the monster variety but are also of the soft   squishy and cuddly kind    just adds something of a lighter note to the movie where it could have become very dark    along with aliens comes the humor and in a pretty decent way    j   well soon to be j   a smart ass cop   played by will smith   runs down what he thinks is a would be villain and gets some attention from the mib and k in particular    k aims to recruit our poor j   but that is not the whole point of this movie    the main duty of the mib is to police the extra terrestrials on earth who have chosen it as a home or a refuge    that s also the main point of this movie   protect the earth from the scum of the galaxy    some of the scum from space is awfully bad and just down right nasty    color commentary abounds when forced to deal with alien scum and none other than will smith and tommy lee jones are there to deliver the punch    the dialogue is witty to say the least    this wittiness lets the movie flow well from scene to scene developing the characters to the extent needed for this movie    tommy lee jones   as k   and will smith   as j   provide both the action and the comedy beautifully    the characters they play don t seem to be wrong in any way nor does their performance as them    i would have to say that k is more amusing than j   but what s one without the other    both roles complemented each other very well and the script seemed to be written for these two actors    the story also goes deep enough to provide a proper background so the audience is not totally clueless    altogether good performances were put in by all the cast and the director blended everything marvelously with the necessary special effects to create a good movie    a movie well worth seeing if you are up for some lighthearted and witty humor    as most movies have their good things they also have their bad things    the character development in this movie was not all that grand because it didn t need to be    but if there was more character development and if there was some development of the alien characters that might have added quite considerable to the movie    especially the evil alien   he did need some work    though this could have been worked on   the movie was what it proposed to be a rather shallow and witty comedy    that was achieved rather well   with some interesting commentary and observations    a movie worth a view   but keep in mind what the movie is and if you are not fond of will smith s form of humor then i wouldn t go    originally written after original release    totally rewritten december 26   1997  
Pos, as feel good formulaic as it may be in its own way   shall we dance    also demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you don t often find in american films    this japanese import tells the story of a middle aged accountant named sugiyama   koji yakusho   whose mundane life is shaken up one night when he spots beautiful mai kishikawa   tamiyo kusakari   in the window of a dance school    intrigued by her melancholy demeanor   and slightly infatuated with her     sugiyama signs up for weekly classes at the school    and   much to his amazement   ends up as attracted to dancing itself as to his young sensei    meanwhile   sugiyama s wife   hideko hara   becomes suspicious of his late wednesday nights   and sets a private detective on her husband s trail    in a hollywood film   you can bet that sub plot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings    in shall we dance     writer/director masayuki suo dispenses with it in a matter of minutes   using it to set up later character interactions rather than letting it overwhelm the story with pratfalls    neither does he make the climactic moment of victory a competition between the hero and some mean spirited token rival    suo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter   allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them    an opening prologue in shall we dance    goes to some effort to place the film in a sociological perspective   explaining how contrary ballroom dancing is to the japanese sense of propriety    it s a forced message in a story which doesn t need such a culture specific angle    the dance school in shall we dance    plays the role of a singles  mixer   with everyone vaguely embarrassed to be there yet taking the opportunity to try on new personalities    most amusing among these new personalities is the one adopted by sugiyama s co worker mr   aoki   naoto takenaka     a balding systems analyst who becomes a fiery latin lover when he dons a frizzy wig and begins to rumba    sugiyama s awakening is less overt   but koji yakusho does a wonderful job showing a transformation of small steps    it s a delicate performance with a huge heart    shall we dance    is a fairly lightweight experience   which makes its final half hour rather a long sit    suo crams a lot of exposition into very little time   including an unnecessarily detailed back story for mai   resulting in a sluggish march towards the resolution    it is here that shall we dance    feels most hollywood conventional   attempting to blind side the audience with a truckload of emotional catharsis    suo might have been better advised to conclude with the small gem of a scene in which sugiyama and his wife take their first tentative dance steps together    that s the real joy of dance shall we dance    conveys   its ability to create an intoxicating mood of romance which can soften the stiffest shirt    
Neg, attention moviegoers   you are about to enter a meaning free zone    should the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes   do not panic    the film will work just as well as a silent movie    chronicling the meaningless lives of vain   yuppie types   the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films   last days of disco   barcelona and metropolitan   but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing    first time writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth    there isn t one of these characters worth caring about    the movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version of   people magazine      among others   the movie features   ben affleck   casey affleck   david chappelle   janeane garofalo   gaby hoffmann   catherine kellner   courtney love   jay mohr   martha plimpton   christina ricci and paul rudd    and unlike people magazine   the people speak   not that they have anything interesting to say    it s new year s eve in 1981   and monica   martha plimpton   is preparing her big party    structured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party   director risa bramon garcia flits back and forth among her stars    monica s apartment is in   noho     an area that one of the guests describes as   so cool   all of the poor people live there      typical of the shallow couples in the movie are kevin   paul rudd   and his friend and would be sexual partner lucy   courtney love      they argue about whether lucy is a slut or not since she sleeps with everyone   except him   of course    she dares him to go immediately to a bathroom stall and have sex with her   which turns out to be neither erotic   funny or successful    rather like the rest of the story    the movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new year s eve birthday       cigarettes are a shield against emotional interaction with other people     kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialog that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie    another character   played by jay mohr   has a problem with his sexual triumphs    every woman he beds falls deeply in love with him by the next morning    when his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him   his response is   i like a lot of people      as the movie finally draws to a close   the characters awaken from their post party game of musical beds    some have passed out early from alcohol abuse and remember little   while others actually have some clue as to what happened    the movie itself is so forgettable that by the time you reach your car in the parking lot   all trace of the film will have vanished from your mind   which is probably the best thing that can be said about the movie    200 cigarettes runs 1   40    it is rated r for profanity   sex and one dope smoking scene and would be acceptable for older teenagers

Pos, i must admit i m going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity   because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend    the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity    i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre   but something drew me to this film    maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role   and the hilarious eugene levy    maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity   con air   and pushing tin    but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life    the story of serendipity is simple    two people   john trager   john cusack   and sara thomas   kate beckinsale   looking ever so hot     have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves    with buck henry smack dab in the middle    charmed beyond repair   these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf   called serendipity   talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down   and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink    but with each of them already involved with other parties   sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera    sara declares that if this   thing      let s just call it love    is destined to happen   fate will bring them together in the future    years later and on opposite coasts of america   john and sara    both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates    decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts    what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat and mouse game with the fates   involving such items as mistaken identity   a graduate homage   john corbett as a freaky new age musician   and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman    to find out if that   thing   was right after all    fortunately   first time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong   well rounded   characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative    coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom   director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones   and the use of time lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years    the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity    both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters  on the flipside   films such as you ve got mail   made in heaven   and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film s main journey at hand    but it s what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture    
Neg, i think we should   as responsible citizens   all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie    he s changing the cinema as we know it  and for the worst    i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments  prologues   epilogues   etc   the premise   a lawyer can t lie for a day    ho   ho    normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible  mr    carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable    i laughed once  and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing    grinding doesn t begin to describe    it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that   if you are a normal person   you leave feeling sick    when it s not trying to be funny   it s trying to be melodramatic  but it s just annoying   stupid and sappy    at best    this movie is intended to make people laugh   yes   not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound    but   it fails on every possible level    it fails to be funny    it fails to be insightful    it fails to be suspensful    it fails to be fun    they should pay people to see it    it suceeds on one level  it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles   for having lived    if you go in with the intention of coming out alive   please make sure that you are overly fond of boob   fart   pimple and fat jokes  otherwise you will go insane    yes   literally insane    stark   raving mad    it is boring   stupid   melodramatic and in the end ugly    i reccemond it strongly    to ed wood    
Pos, if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it s their predictable endings    the devil s advocate has the atypical hollywood ending   when everything that should happen does    unfortunately for the devil s advocate   this ending nearly collapses in on itself   and ruins the entire film    nevertheless   the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment   note to self   kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film      i don t think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan    well   it does contain this element   but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements   and seemingly more interesting ones at that      the devil s advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session    kevin lomax   keanu reeves   is the defense attorney   working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl    he ends up with a not guilty verdict   despite an emotional testimony from the victim   heather matarazzo      he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann   charlize theron   where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury    he accepts   mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive   and he flies to new york with his wife    after proving his worth for selecting juries   and his perfect winning streak in court     the head of the firm   john milton   al pacino     asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer    he graciously accepts   where he is treated almost as a god    he is given an incredible apartment   which is bigger than my entire house now     and a hefty paycheck    his life seems to be on the rise    and of course   his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline    he is attracted to fellow employee christabella   connie nielson     and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment    mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice   especially if it is not wanted    meanwhile   kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen   craig t   nelson   who apparently murdered three people    he spends hours upon hours with this case   while forgetting his loving wife   who may or may not be going insane    all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself    after a while   things turn completely upside down   as kevin s wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends    a fellow employee is murdered in the park   and his mother   judith ivey   reveals information about kevin s real father    is it all just a big nightmare    or is john milton really satan   playing tricks with kevin s life    the devil s advocate plays out fairly straight forward   but for some odd reason   the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don t expect    is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed    if so   the devil s advocate messes up completely   and ironically   i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now   than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early    i went into the devil s advocate expecting a shocking horror film   and that is exactly what i got    i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally   and that is what i got    but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending   did i mention that i didn t like the ending        the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending   they pull the rug out from under you    films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected   more or less    we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way    the devil s advocate   on the other hand   ends unpredictably   not from us knowing a lot   but knowing nothing at all    if that is confusing   i recommend watching the film   and then reading that again    as for the film overall   i enjoyed the entire first two hours   being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study    the film runs like a well built clock   slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax   and an unpredictable one at that      and then you settle in for a nice resolution   which does not occur    it was at this point that i felt cheated    taking us on a terror ride of intrigue   we follow kevin lomax around   as he is the centerpiece of the film    everything occurs from his perspective    he is our representation on screen   sort of      but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game    i don t want to spoil the ending   so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself    perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil s advocate is the extreme amount of everything    it earned its r rating for a reason    there is plenty of nudity   sex   violence   gore   and then you have gore   violence   sex   and more nudity    this film really isn t subtle about anything   showing us everything    it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc 17 rating   as it is quite harsh    however   the movie does have its merits   and nudity and sex are among those    i don t condone sex and nudity in films   but if its there   i might as well enjoy it    the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch    the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining   but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife   mary ann    portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron   mary ann s problems are incredibly intense   and i found myself wanting to witness her decline    this may sound uncaring   but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her    she is the most interesting character on the screen   who is forced into a world where she is not wanted    something the devil s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity   especially for a film of this nature    the story actually has something to say about humanity    in one of the last scenes   john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children   he is satan   of course      he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity    then   god sets up rules which contradict human nature    this semi religious bashing is more humorous than frightening    what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud   partially thinking it was funny   but patially realizing it was true    these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil s advocate   giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing   but i m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on      when a film has something to say about our society   it deserves to be watched    the cast of the devil s advocate is one of the highlights   as we see memorable faces   and they put spins on those memorable faces we don t expect    heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case   and she does a great job    probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves    he has proven himself an uneven actor   successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic     but he tops himself with this performance    i have never seen him more believable to date    al pacino is of course the scene stealer    his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson   the witches of eastwick   and max von sydow   needful things      he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes   but he remains completely believable   if that is the correct term      jeffrey jones   mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller s day off   also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon    judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin s past    connie nielson is very effective in her role   and she also appears naked several times    one familiar face with a twist was   coach   star   craig t   nelson   who gives a very good performance    the devil s advocate is rated r for sexuality   nudity   violence   language   and some gore    at 144 minutes   this film moves along fairly quickly    for the first two hours   i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters    the technical quality is also remarkable   with great special effects and a good musical score    director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture   only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes    i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film   and hackford gave me just that for a long time    but just before the end   he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream    personally   i would have preferred it ending fifteen

Neg, if you re into watching near on two hours of bored   foul mouthed florida teens having sex   doing drugs   having sex   listening to eminem   having sex   playing video games   having sex   and killing one of their peers   then   bully    s for you    based on jim schutze s novelization of a true life event     bully   charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who   in 1993   murdered their high school bully in cold   calculated blood    the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers    in the hands of controversial director larry clark     kids       however   it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker s pornographic proclivities    in terms of the incident and what provoked it     bully   stirs up nothing new    the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot  bored with life   not much ambition   promiscuous   profane    the bully in question   bobby kent   nick stahl     is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn t exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department    he hounds and harries and humiliates his   best friend   marty   played by brad renfro   and marty s girlfriend lisa   rachel miner   doesn t care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby    simply remove him from the equation    marty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous   profane   and stoner friends   plus a recruited hit man         lure bobby to a swamp one night   stab him   beat him over the head with a baseball bat   and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators   presumably   finish him off    there s no remorse  the next day they re talking about it as openly as a homework assignment    they did it because they wanted to   and because they could    what s most troubling about the film   however   isn t the unsettling subject matter and the matter of fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material    not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in   bully   but there s also an uneasy   exploitative feel to it    gratuitous crotch shots abound   one of which makes the zipper cut away in   there s something about mary   look like the height of subtlety !      clark is so pre occupied with his female   predominantly   leads that you forget   at times   what this movie is supposed to be about    the stripping bare   literally and figuratively   of these actors   who are   after all   playing underage teenagers   becomes harder to watch over time   as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera    the conclusion of   bully   offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime    it s a short sequence of stills  heather   7 years   ali   40 years   lisa   life imprisonment   for example  but it s infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it       bully   aims for truth   exploits it shamelessly   then bludgeons it to death    
Neg, in 1989   tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather    was it   deep      nope    however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up    it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was   without the comic book uplift   of the indiana jones and superman pictures    which was true    if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man s escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place    if those films were tom sawyer   then batman was huckleberry finn    some critics   glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone   realized that it was something special   mr   lovell gave it * * * 1/2 and wrote that   this is batman as batman should be        mr   travers called it one of the ten best films of the year    the praise was deserved   from start to finish the film was enthralling   exciting   and superb in every respect    there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton    the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes    the villains   the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman   take over   and our epectations are always left unfulfilled   when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman s nose he simply gets mad   and when we want catwoman to slither over batman s body she gets pushed off a building    i admire mr   burton for trying to do more then entertain   but the result is a mess    nothing works out as planned   it fails both to entertain and to enlighten    hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast    alas   these are only hints    there are   don t misunderstand me   several moments of cinematic genuis contained   catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said   christopher lloyd is trapped   by the penguin   within a giant cage   a small basket is dropped into a large river   but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis    a weak followup   both career and sequel wise   batman returns is sometimes dazzling   but to often dissapointing    
Pos, in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance    ever since wall street   douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid 80 s    in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen   with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world    you d think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good natured veneer   but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton   douglas played the role straight and out in the open    in wonder boys his performance isn t showy or a tour de force   it s simple yet truthful    he embodies grady   a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes    grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map    when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop   we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms    grady points out   in his narration   that they only do so out of jealousy    their target is the very writerly named james leer   played by the always understated tobey maguire     a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for    leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions    he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges    he s portentous and gloomy   as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers   though his act is a little too calculated    he reminds me of the self imposed outcast film director   jim jarmusch   dead man   ghost dog      whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner   the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer     exclusively dressed in black   and with his spiked hair dyed snow white    leer is similar   a guy who equates quirks with depth    tobey maguire fits well in the role    with his round   sweet eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude    but unlike cort   maguire is easier to warm up to   he s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility    katie holmes plays hannah   a beautiful   talented writing student just itching to get in grady s pants    this is a plot line i had trouble with    douglas   in his old age   is beginning to resemble jerry springer   a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions    at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady   maybe it s because i m jealous   and wish holmes was throwing herself at me   after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth     then i think of douglas s real life companion   the breathtaking catherine zeta jones    seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping    suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand   that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie   and i m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas    there is a movie in there somewhere    grady   rather chivalrously if you ask me   resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell   a droll frances mcdormand     who is his age   but also married to another professor    okay   maybe not so chivalrous    there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says     she was a junkie for the printed word    lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice      robert downy j   r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm    downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual    he s arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance    the actor is perfectly cast here   and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor    i wish wonder boys had more of him    searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless   for it meanders through its running time   but that s part of its charm    and maybe i m a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia   a place i m greatly fond of   and a place rarely explored in american cinema    everyone has a sub genre   be it war films   westerns   dance movies   that they happen to be privy to    i m privy to films about literary types i   e    those individuals enthralled by the written word   and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch    the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters   rather than generic mapped out story points    sometimes the dialogue is too clever   but that s a problem i wish i found with films more often    another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted   like its characters   but as the story progresses it begins to open up    for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types   and as a low key comedy for its chuckle worthy throwaway gags    the gags are like those in the great robert altman   m * a * s * h   the long goodbye   movies   where jokes exist as asides on the fringes   like jokes in life often do    the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog   and incessant smoking of marijuana isn t ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things    curtis hanson   who before his last film   la confidential   toiled about with exploitation fare like losin  it   an early tom cruise sex comedy   and the hand the rocks the cradle   has graduated to more meaningful films    he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style   the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up    the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party   but in a wonder boys party   it fits    the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen    it s the cinematic equivalent to a good read   novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies    many will find it slight   but i found much to savor among its subtleties    
Neg, okay   bear with me y all   cause first off i have to get this off my chest    what the hell is up with that damn crab        whew   okay    cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end   as cute as the crab maybe    even i know that you need more footage than * that *    and that wasn t the only thing getting on my nerves    the cutesy gimmicks   saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar   as amanda   and sean patrick flannery   as tom   might have held some appeal during   oh   say the first 10 minutes of the movie    at first the movie moves along at a quick   interesting pace    it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street   whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesn t * die    a ridiculous concept   yes   but at this point i m willing to accept it because i m willing to accept that this is how amanda s life is changed   how her powers are received    later on   the movie can t seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom    and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying   they weren t just repetitive   they were out of place and unnecessary    the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed   sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development   amanda suddenly becoming a great chef   her falling in love with tom   etc       sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good    some places the plot just doesn t make sense   sometimes it s way too contrived   the crab bit   for example     and sometimes too corny   peaches emitting dry ice    can t beat that      all in all the plot seemed fragmented   unconnected    not romantic at all   and only funny in some places    so   okay   do the magic powers come from the crab    or the fairy godfather    she can * float * now too    and all of a sudden   instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches   she can put her emotions into her food    tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda s   witchcraft   in the end    would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac s video    what the hell is up with that damn crab    it is unfortunate   because i liked the basic premise of the movie   until it became too fantastical and tiresome    the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while   but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables    the humor was good in some places   nolan gets the funniest bits   including that incomprehensible   totally random thing with the dolls      gellar and flannery are qualified actors   and gellar has a particular charm   but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy   or even annette in the upcoming   cruel intentions     than this sorry excuse for a character    it s almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is   or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible    the supporting character nolan was a highlight   though he reminded me a bit of kevin in   you ve got mail     see footnotes      and   as always   typical of a chick flick / romantic comedy   there s a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background   cued up at all the right places    this sort of got on the nerves after a while   too       simply irresistible   is not hard to understand   light   funny in some places   and generally disappointing because it can t draw the line between romance and protracted sap   between humor and tired slapstick    and how could i refrain from making a pun                   simply irresistible   is all too easy to resist       first viewing   2/6/99     * did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to   you ve got mail     or   the shop around the corner        business rivals fall in love    female counterpart s business is in danger of being shut down    female as mother  like figure guiding her    the annoying   hysterical ex girlfriends     * i  really  like sarah michelle gellar s wardrobe

Pos, plot   during a 10 week span in london in the fall of 1888   jack the ripper   a man whose identity was never uncovered   committed five ritualistic   grisly murders of prostitutes    this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century old mystery    critique   awesome !  i love dark movies   i love stylish movies   i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp       so  yes   i really dug this movie !  the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance   out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously   and this movie   my friends       is  very serious !  in fact   it s also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell    it ain t for the kids   i ll tell you that much    and if any of those recent hack directors of two bit scream esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective   kill scenes     do not look any further   because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner   especially when compared to their generic slice and dice contrivances    in fact   most of this film s structure is very creative   the actors   all solid   the atmosphere and   feel   of the picture   remarkably real   gotta love those   unfortunates       and the descent into darkness   well honed by the filmmakers    you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time    but it s also an impressive mystery film   based on the true life tale of jack the ripper   a man whose identity was never discovered    the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel   from hell   written by alan moore and presents a compelling story   which despite being a little oliver stone ish   did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely   and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem   sexual depravity   drug usage   insanity   murders and love    yes   the brothers even managed to slip a little   love   story in here   and despite not truly being developed   i guess it could ve been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already    that s right   there s no real need to put any   romance   in a film about a mass murderer !  but that aside   you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp   who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities   to center this movie all the way through    sure   he s just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow   but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one    i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film   i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie   but she was fine   and how little the dreams/fantasies of depp s character had to do with the film s development   from what i had seen in the trailer   i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story   but thankfully   it wasn t      on the downside   the film doesn t really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development    but then again   a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement    i mean   the less i knew about each person   the more suspicious i became of each one s motives   reasons   etc        in fact   i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end   and that was in part   due to the distance to which i d been held from the film s characters       or  am i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention    perhaps    overall   this is an extremely creepy production   with glorious cinematography   reminiscent of coppola s dracula and burton s sleepy hollow     a grim score and solid acting    but it s not for everyone    some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events   and even though the murders aren t shown as graphically as you might think   there s enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors    but i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable   gothic atmosphere   and this flick is just that and plenty more !  and god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the ripper s haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon       brrrrr !  where s joblo coming from    the crow   9/10     dark city   9/10     dracula   7/10     jfk   9/10     the nightmare before christmas   10/10     the ninth gate   8/10     the others   9/10     quills   8/10     shadow of the vampire   6/10     sleepy hollow   8/10

Pos, that thing you do !     r   tom hanks s screenwriting and directorial debut   that thing you do !   has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment   fun   lively   and oh so nice    it is the latter quality   however   that becomes a hindrance   for this  60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast    that thing focuses on the wonders   a teen rock band from erie   pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called   of course     that thing you do !    the group s members are   naturally a diverse group   there s brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy   johnathon schaech     girl crazy lenny   steve zahn     the lead guitarist   a goofy   geeky type known only as the bass player   ethan embry     and the film s center   guy   tom everett scott     the drummer who has aspirations in jazz    along for the wonders  ride to success is jimmy s perpetually neglected galpal   faye   liv tyler      hanks proves to be a capable writer director   deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964   which hanks calls   the last innocent year      the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music   which   like the other recent period music film   grace of my heart   was expressly written for the film   hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes  but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger   which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled   it s still playing in my mind as i write this      it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors   eliciting charming   likable work from the entire cast   most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler   who is remarkable in delivering the film s biggest and best dramatic moment    the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early  60s   they do not appear to be  90s grungers playacting   retro      yet for all the light   frothy charms of that thing you do !   it s nearly nice to a fault    while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days   there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting    everyone is so happy   basking in the glow of overnight success   marvelling at it all  except toward the end   but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness   ending on an appropriately feel good note    there isn t much of an edge throughout that thing  the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks s turn as the wonders  manager  and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it s bland    but a little niceness goes a long way these days   and there s no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do !   it s just about impossible to hate    it s an inoffensive   enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming   if not singing     that thing you do !     quite  possibly for days    to paraphrase a passage from the song   though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play   that thing you do !    
Neg, the ads for   batman and robin   scream   the event of the summer is here   and that s the problem    the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it       batman and robin   is 126 minutes of lavish sets   flashy costumes and big   confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance    it s like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows   bright   busy and visually diverting   but not very much fun    it wasn t always this way    tim burton s   batman   was an epic story of obsession and duality   of darkness and revenge    the film   while far from perfect   was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel    batman was a creepy   brooding creature of the night    the joker   brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson   was at once charismatic and repellent    batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin   battling inner demons and one another over gotham city s breathtaking gothic skyline    those days of the dark knight are gone   replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck       batman and robin   has far more in common with the campy 60 s batman tv show than with tim burton s tale of darkness    the blame lies with director joel schumacher    a former window dresser   schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes    unfortunately   when it comes time to have those people walk and talk   he hasn t the faintest notion of what to do       batman and robin   is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it s often difficult to tell who s whacking who    while the characters flail at each other   one liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti    a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing   but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film       batman and robin   doesn t merely lose momentum   it stalls out completely on several occasions    it s rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one    ironically   the parts of   batman and robin   that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing   and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne    easily the best batman yet   clooney s expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn t even hint at    the film s most effective scene is a tender   quiet exchange between clooney and alfred   michael gough     bruce wayne s butler and surrogate father    as for the other heroes   chris o donnell s robin is enthusiastic   perky and horny as hell   while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl    in a movie filled to the brim with major characters   the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne s girlfriend is puzzling    i suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built in nipples   shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight    of course   the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that s where   batman and robin   really suffers    as mr   freeze   arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years   spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion    laboring under a ton of appliances   schwarzenegger looks as if he s having trouble even moving in his suit   let alone trying to act    uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy    she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character   it s apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain   s/he must be a cartoonish   bumbling nerd      once thurman transforms into the eco psychotic poison ivy   she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss    thurman fails to maintain the character s maniacal sense of style though   and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film    the biggest lesson to be learned from   batman and robin   is that more is not better    joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy   but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is    some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam    i don t think so    my prescription    fire joel schumacher   but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist s convention so he ll understand that there s no hard feelings      give alicia silverstone her walking papers   while keeping clooney   o donnell and michael gough    call jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman    then   ditch the campiness and   for the love of pete   lose the   event   mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time    
Pos, the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire fu copycats    it s not a pretty death   and it s leaving the likes of schwartznager   stallone   and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea    sometimes   the mix results in a mind blowing spectacle unlike any other    quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work   as in 1999 s the matrix   can be a real gem    but too often hollywood gets it wrong   even when they pay off chinese directors    flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists    mostly it s laughable    in hollywood s rush to emulate the success of the matrix   trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form    but iron monkey   the latest asian import   shows us how to get it right    iron monkey   actually a reissue of a 1993 film   is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante   rongguang yu     fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry    but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei hong   most recently seen in one of the most overlooked   and possibly best films of 2000   drunken master 2   released in the u   s   as the legend of drunken master      unlike drunken master 2   which stars jackie chan as an adult fei hong   iron monkey finds a much younger fei hong   sze man tsang   and his father wong kei ying   yen chi dan   thrust into the middle of iron monkey s fight against oppression    iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2   at times   fighting styles   especially that of monkey himself   do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle toed floating of films like crouching tiger   hidden dragon   director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth    iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore   kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger    however   there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters   such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good hearted but misguided enemy   chief fox    in those moments   and in others   iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience    while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2   iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune    aka siunin wong fei hung tsi titmalau    
Neg, the catch phrase for disney s rocket man is one spoken by fred z   randall   harland williams     the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes       it wasn t me !   he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others    well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is   williams can t take all the blame   but he sure can t justify himself with his own simple tag line either    fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy   turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide eyed at a poster of the earth    as a 30 year old   fred hasn t grown up much   but at least he s somewhat closer to his goal   now designing astronaut software for nasa    when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured   nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void            fred    yes   although he s an obviously klutzy moron   nasa doesn t think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program   and time itself   has ever known    for the first part of the film   we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park   he laughs   he screams   but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child s play    his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record breaking feats   much to the dismay of cocky counterpart   mission commander captain overbeck   william sadler     who once held the records    overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet   one being astronaut julie ford   the stupids  jessica lundy     and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist    from here on out   we are subjected to one lame gag after another   dealing with snot   laxatives   and flatulence    you know   standard kid movie material    almost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist   williams is awful in his first starring role    we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring   williams would be it    while he s not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany   stupid comedy   he s just as unlikeable    to say it more understandably   jim carrey might annoy you more   but this guy is even less funny    why    because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role   his performance is too understated and boring    classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy    stan laurel   for example   was so innocent in all his trouble making that we were immediately fond of him    peter sellers   as inspector clouseau   was so self assured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip   it was humor at it s best    williams   on the other hand   can t garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his anti glory    as for the rest of the cast   including some bigger names in smaller roles   beau bridges and shelley duvall     nobody is worth watching whatsoever    this is just another example of the fast food equivalent of cinema   mass produced   less than mediocre   over priced   and hard to stomach    giving it one and a half stars is * extremely * generous   but even i ll admit to laughing a few times    the amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids   laughter was something rarely heard   even from the children !  i must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didn t crack up over every little thing    then again   maybe they were asleep    some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies   claiming adults aren t the targeted audience and therefore aren t meant to   and won t   enjoy them    sadly   it s also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it s presented right    a two hour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there   but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast   which could easily do the same thing    and saying that a parent s perspective isn t important is quite a poor theory to have when they re the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place    
Neg, the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits    the rationale is sound   but in many cases of this and recent years   the sequel is a shoddy product that s exposed for the cash milking vehicle it really is    last year s speed 2 and scream 2   as well as this year s species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory    in some cases   a sequel can even discredit its predecessor   as with the latest neo slasher flick   i still know what you did last summer    whatever uniqueness the original might ve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller    julie james   jennifer love hewitt   and ray bronson   freddie prinze jr     are back from the original to star in i still know   reprising their roles in typical fashion    julie and ray experience a rather predictable falling out at the beginning of the movie   leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson   matthew settle      will and julie hit it off   and along with friends karla   brandy norwood   and tyrell   mekhi phifer     the foursome heads off to a radio station giveaway vacation in the tropics    unfortunately   things aren t so peachy once they arrive   and with a regularity you could set your watch by   the infamous fisherman   muse watson   is back with his hook    it s another bloody showdown   complete with cliffhanger ending    there s not much that s original about i still know   and with the market saturated by gen x thrillers like this one   it s unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel    for die hard fans of the genre   this will be required viewing material   but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer    the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work   but rather a tense   string based score and manipulative editing    the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue    he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments    much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point    the whole reason the plot exists   julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station   is a dead giveaway   lessening suspense and creating a hurry up and wait timing problem    and   whereas the killer s identity might ve been a question in the first movie   it s almost a given here   which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically    three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as   the killer      they re almost used to it   and the performances show it   not hewitt   nor prinze   nor brandy   nor phifer give a decent show    and so   in the end   it s left wide open for a third movie and   most likely   a brand new supporting cast    god help us    
Neg, there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom   surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong worded attack on a group of stoic doctors    when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way   i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture    you see   patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries    i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it   and i actively hate it now   days later   with the simpering   superficial   nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories    i hate every element of the film   beginning with tom shadyac s shameless direction   and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey    the badness of patch adams is stupefying    it s confounding    i can t believe a film can be this bad    and yet   it s based on a real man who probably has a good point to make    in the film   patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams   in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human    in the beginning of the film   patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn t want to kill himself    while there   he notices that the doctors don t care about the patients   and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings    so   patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients    he goes to medical school   where he meets truman   daniel london   and convinces him that it s good to help people    he also meets carin fischer   monica potters     the anti male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor    naturally   the dean of the medical school   bob gunton   hates patch   and wants to thwart his plans   even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams    so patch decides that he s going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have    and that   my friends   is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998    on a superficial level   the film is not particularly bad   i wouldn t say the cinematography bothered me   and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for   i actually liked potter s performance   even if she is wasted      but the film fails fundamentally in execution    every scene swells with grand     emotional   music   played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard    take   for instance   the first scene   which shows patch sitting on a bus    we don t know patch yet   but there s sad music   and it s supposed to make us really sad that he s sad    later on   patch makes a lot of progress   he helps a dying patient   peter coyote   to enjoy the last days of his life   and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively    and when that patient finally dies   spoiler alert !     the music is very very sad    but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions    real drama is character based    you grow to like someone   and then something bad happens   and you feel it    we don t ever grow to know the dying patient   he s simply a vehicle for patch s greatness    real drama doesn t seem forced   or present just to make the audience cry    that s why patch adams is not real drama    it goes for every cheap tear imaginable   wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene    even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman s sickening musical score    sentimentality like this is indeed bad    but it s not as bad as half baked   simplistic themes    you see   patch is a really great student    he aces his tests without studying   and does it so effectively that people think he s cheating    but patch doesn t think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor       why don t we see patients until the third year     he bursts out every three seconds    well   patch   that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients    not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort    most of us have to study    and a doctor who really wants to help   but doesn t know a toe from a finger   probably won t be too successful in preventing death    oh wait   i almost forgot   the point of doctors is not just to   prevent death     but to   improve the quality of life !    yes !  that is true !  and you can not do that without studying    you can not do that without going to medical school    what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe   just maybe   it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later    follow the rules    bah !  who needs the rules !  only uptight doctors follow the rules    the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants    and then there s the free clinic issue   which i find shockingly   frighteningly idealistic    a free clinic    in the middle of the forest    where patients can be taken to be helped    for free    how will patients be transported to the free clinic    will it have an emergency room    or is it just for mental patients    and who   may i ask   will pay for it    the film does give some token attempts to question patch s motives   i think another character asks him how he s going to pay for it   in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance     but they certainly don t explore or challenge patch s ideas to any meaningful extent    reader   please understand this   i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams    i know nothing about him    if his beliefs mirror those of this film character   then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them    but regardless of what the real patch adams believes   the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony    and in the last scene   the big   obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus   patch does a lot of shouting    actually   robin williams does a lot of shouting    he shouts a lot about helping people   and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words    i won t tell you that you can t be moved by his words   because i   too   was moved by his words    i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be    patch adams is the cheapest of them all    
Neg, what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movie    a better question   what would inspire a studio to produce said movie    if you have an answer   let me know    foolish   the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw droppingly horrible film   one with no redeeming value socially   cinematically or otherwise    comedically it has some potential   but only in its stand up comedy moments   which i can turn on comedy central for    master p stars as fifty dollah    beat that !   as a mobster   i think   who is trying to start a comedy club/act with his little brother foolish   eddie griffin      but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss   played by andrew dice clay   for the very first time entertaining     a stubborn club owner and family problems   the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert s   idiot plot     if everyone here wasn t an idiot   there would be no problem    so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names    not a hell of a lot    as i have mentioned   master p cannot act or write    he acts like the rapper that he is    the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced   as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro    as for his script    well   i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience    if you haven t yet figured it out   that is not saying much    co star eddie griffin   really the star of the show   is quite a different story    the fact of the matter is that griffin   whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network   is an extremely talented comedian   stand up and otherwise    he has much in common with chris tucker   rush hour   money talks   in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips    he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity   to the extent which that can be done     and while i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie    and indeed   i laughed at a few stand up scenes here   but from a feature length movie i expect more    foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters    every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke   in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers   foolish blurts out towards his jewelry sporting sibling   you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush     or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car   to which i said   a bit too loudly for the occasion   huh       after getting slightly upset with his wife    believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard earned $8    you ll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you don t have cable    eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative   although offensive   yarn   but everyone else should stay the hell away    &#137

Pos, clue is an unfairly ignored comedy   very similar to 1976 s murder by death    this big screen version of the classic board game   what s next        chutes and ladders   the motion picture     is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue    the plot   for what it s worth   has all the characters from the game   in this case   the names from the game are used as aliases   meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr   boddy   lee ving     the man who s been blackmailing them all    when he turns up dead   everyone   including the audience   must figure out whodunnit        and in what room   and with what object    while not as witty as neil simon s murder by death   clue definitely has it moments    it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i m joking around with my friends    to this day   whenever someone says the phrase   well   to make a long story short   i have the follow up phrase   too late   ready to go    the cast   all very good comedic talents   play well off one another   while the late madeline kahn   as the dark and sultry mrs   white   sometimes steals the film away from the rest    and colleen camp   as the french maid yvette   displays some of her natural talents as well    clue is available on dvd from paramount home video    it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1   85   1   and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions   and features the original theatrical trailer    a french language audio track is also available    the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not   and it even includes a scene not in the film itself   a scene that should have been in the film   as it s a good joke      also   the trailer is scored to the music from airplane !   which was an interesting choice    when clue played in theaters   it ran with the gimmick of three different endings    if you wanted to see all three   you had to go to the movies three separate times    so when the film was released on home video   rather than releasing three separate videos   all three endings were included on one tape        the first two endings being   what if      endings and the third ending being the actual ending    now for the dvd release you get two choices    you can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you       note   there s an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this    after watching the film with a randomly selected ending   when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it    when you do   a secret menu opens   allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves      now while i applaud the effort of paramount here   as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc   it just doesn t work well    first   why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch    maybe someone like myself who s seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only    i m no technical dvd expert   but i can t imagine that being too hard to accomplish    secondly   the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious   thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely don t need a distraction    finally   the back of the dvd case states   and now   with this special dvd version   you can see all 3 surprise endings      i have no idea why they would word it that way   since that s not a special feature in the slightest    the video has been out for fifteen years now   good lord   has it been that long     and it s played on television with all three endings all the time    these are merely minor complaints however   seeing that i ve watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd    the picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy   and i m thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format    [pg]  
Pos, copyright 1996 graeme huggan carry on henry is all about henry viii and his eight wives !  sid james plays henry   who no sooner has the film started   is getting rid of his present queen and hopes to find another one soon    as part of his alliance with france   he requests the hand in marriage to the queen of normandy   joan sims      she comes to england in the hope of marrying henry but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has a reeking garlic breath   he is totally averse to the idea of marriage    henry s court is very corrupt   with the cardinal   terry scott   trying to bribe cromwell   kenneth williams   and cromwell trying to bribe the king    there is a state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen   sims   in the tower of london ready for execution    the queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before   so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey   who has a rather lecherous character to play this time    the cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices !  owing to circumstances   sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and sometimes that he isn t    this is because of renewed threats by the king of france   peter gilmore   to come over himself   which in the end he does    by then   henry has found himself a new queen   played by none other than barbara windsor !  it looks like he has some explaining to do !  there are stand out performances by sid james as henry   joan sims as marie   and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal    also there are cameos from kenneth connor and peter butterworth   who plays barbara s father    the set and costume design is first class and the overall production of this film is good    there is even an early appearance from david prowse   who later became the green cross code man and darth vader    the film does have it s downsides though   as it is getting pretty routine for the carry on team to stage historical films and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly    there is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw   who could have helped the film along    however   overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy jokes   so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only   but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyone s while to sit down and watch it    
Neg, did i do something bad    i must have   because sitting through this movie was sheer punishment    here s the plot    ricky   jeff goldblum   is producer of the good buy network   one of those 24 hour home shopping channels    the new boss   robert loggia   plans to can ricky s behind if he doesn t turn the previous months  flat sales numbers around   and to add to his problems   ricky also has to work with kate   kelly preston     the ivy league wunderkind whom the boss has brought with him    kate and ricky don t get along and don t have any great ideas until they meet g   eddie murphy     a spiritualist who sees something positive in everything    his soothing voice and simple logic makes people feel good   and it s this quality that will make g the new gbn television star and the key to the network s success    the first problem is a flaw in the plot    sure   g makes people feel good    sure   we re told that most people feel guilty after buying an impulse item   no matter how wealthy they might be   and i ll even believe that g talks a talk that allows people to feel good about what they ve bought    but   hey   that s after they ve bought it    why do sales skyrocket the first time g is on camera    far from trying to sell the product   g instead blathers on about how you don t even need the thing    someone please tell me how this is supposed to move merchandise in the first place    you might say that people feel good about what they ve bought   so they come back and by more   but due to the simple fact that the first round of sales in inexplicable   i m not convinced this is what the filmmakers had in mind    the whole movie is therefore seriously undermined because the key point in the plot is never credible    another problem is in the humor    you know   if you see that eddie murphy is in a movie   i think it is not unreasonable for you to expect that the film is a comedy    whoa   partner   are you in for a surprise    holy man is not funny    murphy   the one asset you d think this movie has   remember how they brought him in at the last minute to save best defense      then again   maybe you don t   is seriously reigned in    the script gives him almost nothing to work with   and it seems as though director stephen herek kept him toned down so that the other actors in the film wouldn t be left as window dressing    there s only one moment in the film where murphy is allowed to let loose   and it lasts for three shouted words   which seem totally out of place as a result    pathetic    in all   there are about three jokes that work in the entire picture   and they re not even that great    as a side note   there are some cameo appearances such as dan marino pitching a contraption which allows you to cook off of your car engine   and james brown introducing a medic alert device that shouts   help me !    just like the hardest working man in show business at the push of a button   but these never cause your personal laugh o meter to rise above the level of mild bemusement       well     you ask     surely there must be some convincing performances to make up for the lack of humor      think again   buckwheat    jeff goldblum disappoints    kelly preston is flat   but not like that      robert loggia   in the kind of role for which he has been virtually typecast   can t do anything with it    the script is part of the problem   but these actors don t even look like they believe in the move they re making    they look a lot like they re bored    just like the audience    so what do you have when the humor is absent from your comedy   and the acting is like the siberian steppes    a film that drags more than a dropped anchor    but wait !  as if these problems don t make the film slow enough   the screenplay s pacing makes the movie even slower !  it takes the entire first half hour to establish the movie s premise   then more time as the film wades through a tortuous   and seemingly mandatory   romance between ricky and kate   and a sub plot involving a conniving pr man   eric mccormack   who wants to discredit g and take over ricky s job as producer    when the pr guy s plan is foiled   the film is climaxes   we re treated to that little epilogue   and then we can all go home   right    wrong    the movie goes on for another half hour !  continental drift is the indy 500 compared to the pace of holy man !  the only thing holy about holy man will surely be the number of people exclaiming   holy ! @#% that movie was awful !    this one is for the truly pious    
Neg, every now and then   reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed    most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact   either good or bad   that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings    but   sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons    i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review    the impression left by the film wasn t overwhelming   on the contrary   there were hardly any impression at all   since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it    which surprise me to this day   because the movie theatre was full   i was close to sound speakers   the show wasn t late and i didn t lack sleep before the show    such things happen very rarely to me   and   after many years   the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself    the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters   old peter brackett   nick nolte   and young   aspiring sabrina peterson   julia roberts      two of them are assigned to cover the train collision    as soon as they meet   they start scooping each other   but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk   and also the romantic feelings they have for each other    the plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d    tre   romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn    movie author   director and screenwriter charles shyer   who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride   tries again   this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts    however   although there is some chemistry between the two   soon it stops to arouse any interest    it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix   that collides light hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers    shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two   and fails in both areas   making the story cliched and predictable    the end result is rather forgettable effort   which convinced me not to watch movie again    i ll give it the benefit of the doubt   though

Pos, in december of 1996   a little movie called   scream     was released   became a box office smash   and resurrected films targeted at teens    first   it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad   both   scream   movies     i know what you did last summer       urban legend     etc       but just recently   the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre   a  la  80s john hughes     starting with last june s   can t hardly wait      it may be the first week of april in 1999   but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25 and under market almost every single week     varsity blues       jawbreaker       cruel intentions       simply irresistible       the rage   carrie 2     and   the mod squad      coming april 9 are two more of this type     never been kissed   and   go     and on april 23   we ve got the teen satire   election   and the teen horror comedy   idle hands      jeesh !  out of all of these moves   however   the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation     10 things i hate about you     is this past january s mediocre   ho hum   she s all that      although similar in plotting   ok   darn near identical       10 things i hate about you     a modern day version of shakespeare s   the taming of the shrew       she s all that   got its inspiration from   pygmalion       is an infinitely superior film in every department   from the smart direction by first time feature director gil junger to the charming and well written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast   who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985 s   the breakfast club      and to top it all off   in the inevitable climax set at the prom   at least we didn t have to once again suffer through a goofy   inappropriate dance sequence   who could forget   or want to remember   for that matter   this ludicrous development in   she s all that          the day wide eyed   shy new student cameron james   joseph gordon levitt   starts school at seattle based padua high   he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore   bianca stratford   larisa oleynik      although he doesn t know french   he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her   but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father   larry miller   won t allow her to date until her bitter   unconventional older sister   kat   julia stiles     a senior   decides to    kat   of course   has sworn off the likes of boys   but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her   which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona   heath ledger      complicating matters   cameron s dorky friend   michael   david krumholtz     decides to use a wealthy jock   joey   andrew keegan     who also has his sights set on bianca   as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him   and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey    as you can see     10 things i hate about you   includes a huge number of characters   some of which i haven t even mentioned   such as kat s shakespeare obsessed friend   mandella   susan may pratt   and bianca s materialistic comrade   chastity   gabrielle union      at a short   but well used running time of 98 minutes   all of the characters are perfectly handled   satisfyingly developed   and   for the most part   are not treated as caricatures   another flaw of   she s all that     where the bad guys   and gals   ran around constantly saying     you re vapor        since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters   and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective   i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained    aside from a good screenplay   it s the performances that can make or break a movie   and director junger has really hit the jackpot    aside from joseph gordon levitt     3rd rock from the sun       who gives his strongest performance to date here   none of the actors are that well known   but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings    as the main character of kat   julia stiles   last seen in the miniseries   the  60s     is marvelous and always believable   and certainly has a bright future ahead of her    even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard edged   it was easy to identify with kat s way of thinking   she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath     and i completely admired her individuality    no one   i think   could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does    heath ledger   as the infamous bad boy of the town   injects much life into patrick   and has a lot of chemistry with stiles    one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who   with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith   is able to turn bianca into a person with multi dimensions   even though she is accurately self centered at the on set    in one truthful scene   cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish   and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes   she has    one off beat element of the film   and a source of some hearty laughs   is the way that the school s staff act   which is strikingly unformal    allison janney   as the guidance counselor ms   perky   who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel   is comic dynamite   as is daryl   chill   mitchell as the english teacher   who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and   at one point   sends kat to the office because   for once   she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good    although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning   most of it actually works   especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters    in one very funny scene   chastity asks     i know people can be overwhelmed   and they can be underwhelmed   but can people just be       whelmed      at another point   bianca and kat s father   a stand out larry miller     who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant   only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion   before she leaves   she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it s like to be pregnant       10 things i hate about you   once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre   and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the  90s    it also helps that the movie has a perfectly assembled soundtrack   mixing indie rock with new wave  80s songs   and with   thank goodness   no rap      by the film s end   it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together   and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up   especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca   kat and her father   and a flawlessly acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class   this is where the title comes from      luckily   i doubt i

Neg, in french   the phrase   film noir   literally means   black film      webster defines it as   a type of crime film featuring cynical malevolent characters in a sleazy setting and an ominous atmosphere that is conveyed by shadowy photography and foreboding background music      classic film noir   including such memorable fare as   the big sleep     the original   cape fear     and orson welles  striking   a touch of evil     employed black and white photography to emphasize the long shadows associated with the genre    color came into play with neo noir films like   chinatown   and   blade runner         l   a   confidential     easily the best film of 1997   is a wonderful piece of contemporary neo noir filmmaking    for a textbook example of how to take all the elements of neo noir and create an absolute mess   there s   palmetto      based on   just another sucker     a short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase     palmetto   shows what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance    director volker schlondorff     tin drum     the handmaid s tale     stated   we weren t even sure for a long time if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy      it shows       palmetto   is too preposterous too be taken seriously as a thriller and too ponderous to work as a comedy    the story begins when journalist harry barber   woody harrelson   is released from prison    someone turned state s witness and revealed that harry was framed   a   reward   for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto    bitter and broke   harry plans to hitchhike to miami and start his life over   but ex girlfriend nina   gina gershon   appears to return him to palmetto    while hanging out at a bar   he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth    harry pockets her cash   only to have the woman reappear and catch him with her money in his pocket    no problem   though    the radiant blonde is rhea malroux   elisabeth shue     the young wife of a very rich older man with heart problems   and she has a proposition for harry    rhea needs   a threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom   for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette   chloe sevigny      the girls want to bilk a half million dollar   ransom   from the old man and will happily give harry $50   000 for helping with the scam    things go wrong   of course    odette is found dead   leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks    in an ironic twist   harry is asked to work for the local d   a    s  office    they need a press liaison to field questions about odette s kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job    not a bad set up for a noir film   if only schlondorff knew how to handle the material   but he never settles on a consistent tone    the actors don t know what to do with their characters either   muddling the proceedings even further    as if that wasn t enough   the story suffers from major problems in logic    woody harrelson is a talented actor with an admirable willingness to take on risky parts   but he s lost here    presented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged   it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme    harrelson clearly doesn t know what to do with harry s character   so he spends most of the film glowering   sweating and generally acting miserable    meanwhile   elisabeth shue gives a goofy performance   behaving like a vamp on nitrous oxide    as the stepdaughter   chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr   despite a number of steamy scenes   there s no chemistry between harrelson and the women    to make matters worse   schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character s lips are running over each others bodies    two particularly bad scenes highlight the film s problems    while driving with a body in his trunk   harry has a minor car wreck and a cop shows up    the officer wants to help change harry s flat tire and asks him to open the trunk    harry s pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might have worked if played as comedy   but under schlondorff s grim direction   the scene is just embarrassing    the film s nadir comes when a bad guy prepares to kill harry and nina    we re supposed to be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub filled with acid   but by this point the film has foundered so badly that the scene is merely reminiscent of when jessica and roger rabbit were suspended over a vat of dip    had   palmetto   been played with tongue firmly in cheek   it might have been an entertaining shaggy dog story    but under the harsh direction of schlondorff   the film is just a sluggish paint by numbers exercise in neo  noir cluelessness    avoid this nonsense and go see   l   a   confidential   instead    
Neg, it seems that i ve stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch    take payback   for example   a movie that most people seem to like    however   it s horrible schlock   straight out of hollywood s vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies    it was written and directed by a guy who should have done better   however   maybe he did do better   after all   30 percent of the movie isn t his own    mel gibson   that hollywood zombie   decided he didn t like the ending and had another director reshoot it    what a crock    if you sign on to do a movie   then do it the way the script calls for    why film a movie and then look at it later and say     no   i changed my mind   i don t like the ending    you re fired    let s get someone else to do it      i suppose honor is dead in hollywood    the end of the film is   of course   hollywoodized    which is to say that it s happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize    in this case   as is most victories in hollywood movies   gibson s prize is a blond and money    i miss originality in film   i really do    i think audiences are so starved for it that they ll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original    payback s tagline   get ready to root for the bad guy   promised an original idea   but it was far from the truth    while gibson s character certainly broke the law   he was a character that had honor   odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it     wouldn t kill in front of children and protects his blond woman    there s nothing bad about him   he s a hollywood character   a person who could never exist in real life    and gibson knows it   he spends his time trying to act like a   bad guy     and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant    the story involves gibson being double crossed by his partner   who is a real bad guy   which made me wish that we could root for him   over $70   000    gibson recovers from multiple gunshots   is pissed   naturally     and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back   no more   no less    he makes a point of it that it s strictly 70 grand    a real bad guy would have made his ex partner pay 25% interest    this idea is completely stretched out    gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with    what i didn t understand   this is the chicago mafia    $70   000 is like spare change to them    they d probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him    i think they d respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple $70   000    maybe i m being too hard on the movie    perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie    i read roger ebert s review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy    that s why we re allowed to root for him    and it s true   gibson walks the movie as if he s smiling at a joke he just heard    but he s wrong here    i wanted a lee marvin or old time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn t a comic   just an ass kicker    as a side note   i ve just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback    after this many reviews   why would anyone want to read this    really   i don t care    i m just trying to gain membership into the on line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can    
Neg, robin williams has the rarest of gifts   the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style    overwhelmingly   his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best   with the notable exception of flubber      so when i   the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams   tell you that not even williams can save his latest project   you know it s in trouble    jakob the liar is a confused   muddled little movie   a generically   uplifting   film with a fundamental contradiction   the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn t realize it    williams plays jakob haim   a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii    one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high ranking german officer for his punishment    jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast    the announcement   in english   but punctuated by a triumphant   heil hitler !     is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob s ghetto    liberation ! he thinks    the next day   jakob tells the news to his closest friend   a volatile prize fighter named misha   liev schreiber     who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along    soon   it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home    a crime punishable by death    this is absurdly false   but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this   the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate    the danger   of course   is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto   and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger    in a curiously irrelevant subplot   jakob finds a 11 year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home    apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered   and goes to great length to make sure of that    just why the idea frightens him is never made clear    he and the girl build an uninvolving   generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning    the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine    but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false    such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren t met   the results are far worse than if there was no hope    that s the film s biggest detriment   it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false    it s never moving because it doesn t give us anything to be moved by    jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing    robin williams doesn t inject the film with life   as a matter of fact   he seems a little out of it   as if crippled by his fake accent    he is stragely unenthusiastic   his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless   hopeless    not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent   this isn t the robin williams we know and love    in good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it    here   he is more of a wannabe serious actor   an impostor    jakob the liar will be compared with last year s life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a   holocaust comedy      it s not a comedy    it tries   sometimes   but it rarely works    is it a melodrama    a war movie    a character study    no   no   and no    jakob the liar is the kind of movie that can t be placed into a category   not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts    
Neg, synopsis   valerie   a high school junior who doesn t look a day under 22   writes bad poetry   complains about how much she hates school   fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women   chooses him as a pen pal   and plays hooky to see him in court    after a jailbreak   the killer puts on big sunglasses   wears a half buttoned jacket   and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie    comments     alan smithee   directed fatal charm   which should have been more appropriately titled   fatal bore   or   fatal crap      if you find out that a film you re about to see is directed by   alan smithee     then you should seriously   seriously   seriously consider watching something   anything   else       alan smithee   is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad    frankly   i d be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey   so i think i understand why the director might have picked the   alan smithee   moniker for this film    where to begin with this painfully poor thriller    let s start with the acting    it s pretty bad    amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent   the rest of the cast don t     even though her performance isn t exactly stellar material    she s also miscast   she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete    her scenes with valerie s mother   played by mary frann   are a joke    the two look as though they re a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together   rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn t understand    christopher atkins   a handsome enough actor who plays the killer   adam   looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm    trying to appear malicious and dangerous   he wears large sunglasses and a half buttoned jacket    if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber   atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead   but he doesn t cut it here    early on in the movie   a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom    outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers   the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film    they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever    fatal charm s storyline   such as it is   inspires more yawns than thrills    the script belabors a red herring   early on   about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam   atkins   is charged with    this suspect   however   turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film   an obvious plot fault    even for the idiots who didn t consider the movie s title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed   it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up    so   the audience must wait   if they haven t already stopped watching   as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn out finale    the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an   erotic thriller      a thriller it isn t   and neither is it particularly erotic    i can t imagine   if someone were in the mood for something   erotic     that he d be happy after watching this fluff    a few erotic moments occur in the film   they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus   see   they re supposed to be valerie s fantasies    how creative      on a personal note   i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through    it s no wonder why she hated high school so much    as an instructor of english myself   i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature   a teacher would stoop to reading a student s bad poetry   of course   it s valerie s   about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem s inspiration    i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students    fatal charm won t charm anyone   unless there s someone that s charmed by boring   lifeless   insipid   suspenseless thrillers    if you happen upon this turkey   just keep moving on

Neg, the great actor james woods once said   and i m paraphrasing       if sex isn t messy   then you re not doing it right      a truly profound statement   and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre   just replace   sex   with   your mad slasher film        for those uninformed souls   the mad slasher genre   or sub genre   is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline   a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween    urban legend is a mad slasher flick   but one that is so sanitary   bloodless   and nudity free   that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful   though not overly talented   cast   it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special    for film makers   gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale   fright free horror movie   as stephen king once said   again paraphrasing     if you can t scare your audience   gross em  out   if you can t do that   make em  laugh      alas   urban legend succeeds only at the latter   though not by intention    i actually find the fact that this film became a minor success   $40 million domestic box office gross   more frightening than anything in it    it seems that audiences  tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt    the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills   but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them    unfortunately   these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations   one idiotic super hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don t need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering    if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin   wild wild west   and godzilla    but forget all that   it goes without saying that mad slasher films   or any other exploitation off shoot   will be made without an ounce of craft   especially considering the sheer volume that are produced      allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film   the lack of enthusiastic exploitation    these flicks aren t harnessed with any lofty aspirations   so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time    sadly out of the literally hundreds made   i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while    and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three    despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame   it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes    as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend s setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities   it takes place on a college campus   which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer    you see   the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface    all those young people are growing up together   going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows   so naturally some weirdness is expected    all the better for that elusive crazed killer    coupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around   and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task    but alas   urban legend is not only idiotic and clich     full   it s way too clean   a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity   little gore   and much stupidity    this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than   i dunno   exercise    it s the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running like the wind prey   yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques    it s the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack    i really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud noise jump scare thing    yes the audience jumps   momentarily frightened   but wouldn t anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room    i lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer    apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers    in scream it was a ghost mask   scary enough     in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man s rain slicker   in the middle of summer no less     and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody   the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood   ooh       scary   intended to conceal his/her identity    for urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume    though i must admit   urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film    the film s killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends   you know   like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they re coming from inside the house      i won t spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used   after all the film does offer fine 2   00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough    sad to say   it doesn t include my favorite urban legend   a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil    now that would be scary    before i leave you   i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film   the first being the lack of craft   the second the lack of exploitation      its characters   all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i ve ever spent an evening with    only jared leto   looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day   and alicia witt   as the resilient heroine   avoid vexatiousness    the most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum   as a supremely irritating lout   so irritating i actually cheered his painful death   and i am not a cruel person      ironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film   if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining    after all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can t stand getting slaughtered   which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i can t

Pos, the verdict   spine chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king   featuring an outstanding   oscar winning performance from kathy bates    geez   french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this !  sorry   non british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders   my apologies    the pair are british comediennes   jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in   absolutely fabulous       who did a series of film spoofs a few years back   including alien   the exorcist and misery    needless to say   amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates   the resemblance was quite uncanny !     dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder s legs !  but despite the lingering memory of their sketch   and although i ve now seen the film a couple of times now   that   hobbling   scene was no less disturbing !  i m still left screaming at the telly in revulsion !  that may be the most memorable scene   but it s certainly not the only worth watching    stephen king   whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality   strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale    it s a nicely crafted psychological horror   which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon   james caan      rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes   bates     who introduces herself as the writer s   number one fan     he soon becomes her prisoner    both the script and kathy bates  beautifully masterful performance   for which she won an oscar   work arm in arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit cake   or is that fruity as a nut cake        bates relishes her demanding role   and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece    at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour   at times she s a rather tragic character   and more often than not she s just damned scary !  this is basically a very simple tale   but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity    it s an involving   engrossing experience   and considering it s basically a two hander   mainly set in one locale   it s a remarkable piece of cinema    there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences   this one relies solely upon rob reiner s stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan    oh   i haven t really mentioned caan yet   he does a good job as the writer who s a prisoner of his own success   annie is obsessed with him and his books      but   as you no doubt gathered from the above   bates is well and truly the star of the show    along with the pig   of course !  anyway   the tension is built up with masterful aplomb   and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense    there s the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve shattering lengths to poison her wine    he succeeds   but       she  knocks the glass over !  i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well !  in the immortal words of homer j   simpson     d oh ! !    other nerve wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house    we cut to annie in her car   she s on her way home       he  realises this and tries to get back to his room       cut  to the car again   she s getting near       will he make it    ok   so these sequences aren t exactly original   nor perhaps unpredictable   but they work !  boy   do they work !  if a film has you on the edge of your couch   biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense   then it s doing something right !  of course   the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned   hobbling   !  annie realises her captive has been out of his room   and she s going to stop him once and for all    cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer   and       i feel ill just thinking about it !  nasty    it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand   and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho !  and then we re given one of the most ridiculously over the top fight scenes i ve ever seen    she gets hit over the head with a typewriter   set on fire   head smashed against the wall   and she just won t die !  sheldon isn t in terribly good shape either    if it weren t so gorey it would almost be laughable    but it s a terrifically effective film   and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked    misery is a tight   tense   intense and chillingly entertaining thriller    the directing is first rate   and the performances   bates in particular   contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem    wonderful stuff         *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   for more regularly updated film and tv reviews   check out my site !  http   //www   geocities   com/hollywood/bungalow/4960    *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *    
Neg, tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance   and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi tiered marketing materials for crap movies    and here he hits rock bottom   with planet of the apes    i didn t expect much from this latest   interpretation   of pierre boulle s classic novel planet of the apes    i mean   how could you top the force and impact of the original film   intelligently co scripted by rod serling   of twilight zone fame   combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those   damn dirty apes     in one of his best roles of his career    sadly   i sat down to watch burton s version of planet of the apes and within the first 20 minutes   i was checking my watch and my girlfriend   a big fan of the original film   started to nod off    this time around   the story plays out like a cross between enemy mine   braveheart   and project x   marky mark wahlberg   who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter   plays leo davidson   a hot shot u   s   air force pilot    leo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms   no real explanation given in the film   and leo sends one of his genetically altered   smart   chimps into the storms to collect data    leo and his crew lose communication with the chimp   leo hops in another ship to find the monkey   and then he s thrown through some type of time space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot   all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle    leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo   paul giamatti   who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari   helena bonham carter      the kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo s ship    along the way   monkeys played by tim roth   overacting his role of a vicious general named thade   and michael clarke duncan   who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie   strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages   just like battlefield earth !  in the end   it all culminates into another braveheart rip off human versus ape battle scene    while rick baker s makeup work is amazing   the script is a pathetic hodgepodge   courtesy of three writers     the acting is horrible   and the   surprise   ending feels like a swing from a ball peen hammer into the temple    wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences    this remake   or re interpretation   as tim burton has proclaimed it   is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film    the ethical arguments about the equality of species   fascism   and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue   an unimaginative narrative structure   and a romance between a monkey and a human    even chuck heston s anti gun tirade   in the de rigeur cameo   seems shallow and jokey    but the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton    even though his name is plastered across every billboard in america   john badham could have directed this film    even joel schumacher could have directed this film    he probably should have    burton s predominant themes of rejection   isolation   and the search for one s place in the universe   as seen in ed wood   edward scissorshands   and pee wee s big adventure   are completely absent in this planet    i suppose that s what happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole    
Neg, when the haunting arrived in theaters   all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects    while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department   i don t think that they are completely to blame for this movie s failure    it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the   unseen   terrors   and it was about as scary as a dust bunny    so special effects or not   if the story isn t the least bit scary   you aren t going to end up with a very frightening movie    the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern    dern is always great   and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie    as i sat through the seemingly endless   albeit fairly impressive   special effects   i kept wishing that this movie was about dern s caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast    never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie    liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear    he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion    he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia    and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings on    catherine zeta jones   lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects    like the original   taylor s character is the star of the movie    but since she doesn t quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms   zeta jones   their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original    and let s face it   probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta jones    i ll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren t in it    but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets    they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients    there really isn t much of a story here    just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with    and the special effects are great    in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere    in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the   cool shots   quota    at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary    funny   maybe    but not scary    then we have the set    when i first saw the house   i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it    but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did   and decided to take the idiotically overdone route    this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves    what part did these rooms play in the story    absolutely none    they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie    then we have the actors    lili taylor has never been one of my favorites    and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in   she comes in around the average or slightly below mark    i have no idea why liam neeson took this role    he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus    his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him    i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman    zeta jones was cast because she is too hot for words    the fact that her character is bi sexual is just icing on the cake    all catherine has to do in this movie is look good    fortunately that is something she does very well    while she does have a fairly good size part   it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye candy    it s too bad someone of her talents wasted them here    any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role    the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999 s horror movies   the blair witch project    the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget   while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares    both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film    if the story sucks   it s all downhill from there    my advice    if you are looking for special effects   go rent star wars    if it s scares you want   rent halloween    either way   it s probably in your best interests to skip the haunting    
Pos, you ve got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk    the title is generic    it s meaningless    and i can t believe it s good business    when you pick up the phone and dial 777 film   how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean claude van damme movie   the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot   is called   geez   maximum risk    yuck    the movie itself deserves your attention    for sweet bloody thrills   this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands down    only mission   impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller   and i ll give maximum risk the edge simply because it s not as slick as the tom cruise picture   and therefore more gratifying in its execution    much to my surprise   van damme continues to develop as a pleasant   unpretentious action hero    his track record isn t as solid as schwarzenegger s   but he s a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold    in 1993   van damme worked with hong kong s premier hardcore action director   john woo   on a fairly lame movie called hard target       if you can find a bootleg copy   woo s radically different director s cut is much better than what was eventually released      this follow up is directed by ringo lam   city on fire   full contact     whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo s more operatic offerings    the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo s subsequent broken arrow    here s the rundown    van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend   jean hugues anglade   finds a corpse that s alain s exact double    turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother   michael   who has been killed by some russian heavies   and some strangely american looking cops      alain does some investigating    he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city   and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia    assuming michael s identity   alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael s girlfriend   natasha henstridge     the fbi   and the russian mob in little odessa    that s as much as you need to know    the story is adequate   but not overly involving    and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice   just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment    there s a love story   too   but i didn t find it terribly convincing   partly because ex model henstridge is too high strung in her high profile debut   she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species      she s great to look at   and she can certainly read a line   but what she does here can t really be described as   acting      of course     acting   isn t really what she was hired for   i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme s      the movie is exceptionally violent   bordering on gratuity       keep that in mind when planning your date      the stunts are spectacular   and the fact that you can spot van damme s stand in makes his work no less impressive    there s only so much you can do with a car wreck   but this movie makes crisp   effective use of pile ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies    and lam has a surprising   innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action    the main difference between lam and woo   i believe   is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces   lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double barreled points of view to make things run    don t get me wrong    when chow yun fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo s hard boiled   it s an amazing moment    but it s a moment that s hard to reproduce in hollywood       for one thing   hollywood doesn t yet have chow yun fat !    while woo s hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart   maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture    the very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city   but lam s use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on    the film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam s shooting style   accentuating rather than amplifying the action    the performances could have used some fine tuning   in particular   there s an annoying   overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely     and the movie doesn t always overcome the limitations of its genre    the story is a little mundane   although there are some effective moments involving van damme s unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had    but it s not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture   and it s doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity    van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man s best movie   and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong/hollywood hybrid    
Neg, a fullyloaded entertainment review   website coming soon !  hunter s   thompson s fear and loathing in las vegas   written in 1971   is already an american classic   not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post psychedelia of the 1960 s   but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as   gonzo      soon after the book was written   hunter s   thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke    and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas   the movie      although the book is one of my favorites   i now agree with thompson s own assessment of the novel as   unfilmable      the main problem is that the book   although detailing wild drug use and tripped out adventures   was not written on the road    it was written and edited by hunter s   thomspons   relatively sober   at his home    so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use   it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor    hunter s   thomspon   the narrator   while always drugged out   still has a grip on reality   and can still tell   with journalistic ability   what is going on around him    not so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas    despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped   the movie is an exact duplicate of the book   in terms of dialouge    unfortunately   this can get annoying   in the form of johnny depp s   who plays thompson   excessive narration    and the characters   while having vivid personalities   are played as 2 d characers on the screen   dr   raoul duke   johnny depp   the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson s   and his riding companion   dr   gonzo   benicio del toro     who is a large samoan lawyer   have no personalities or emotions at all   save for stoned    the film is very faithful to the plot   what there is   of the book   in that dr   raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400   and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs    from there   one set of stoned adventures after another happens   including one of the few good scenes in which depp   high on acid   watches all the people in the bar around him turn into   literally   lounge lizards    while the movie has its moments   few     it is almost unwatchable at parts   especially towards the end    despite a lot of celebrity cameos   the stars never get off the ground    the set decoration and costumes are great   and probably deserve an oscar nomination    however   as we all know   it s not sets or effects that make a movie   its the characters   and quite frankly   these characters are no good    
Neg, a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i ve ever reviewed on paper    i didn t know at the time that i d soon encounter and despise batman & robin   which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer    as directed by joel schumacher   who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isn t very good at either     b & r is one long excuse for a taco bell promotion    the plot   which has mr   freeze and poison ivy   uma thurman   planning to take over gotham city and then   the vorld     as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states     is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust   partnership   blah   blah   blah    but morals are not the point of this film  topping each bloated   confusing action scene with next one is    the garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls    since when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel    only george clooney comes out on top   he underplays nicely and pretends like he s in a real movie    
Neg, according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers   isolated motels   diners   gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers    at the beginning of eye of the storm   1991 german  american thriller directed by yuri zeltser   one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up    ten years later their son steven   played by bradley gregg     who was blinded during the incident   still runs motel together with his older brother ray   played by craig sheffer      hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone   played by dennis hopper   gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra   played by lara flynn boyle      their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed    yuri zeltser   author of this film   was obviously inspired by hitchcock s psycho   but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot    instead of norman bates we have two brothers   one of them traumatised physically   another mentally    sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband    eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense   with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere    the acting is fine   hopper   gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles   but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine    unfortunately   eye of the storm   which was supposed to be intense psychological drama   deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale    in the end   this film reminds us that original approach can t prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities       special note to the profiler fans   ally walker appears in the beginning of the film in the small role of killer s girlfriend      
Neg, after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy   i was ready for some mindless fun  oh   maybe something like tango & cash    maybe not !  mindless fun is one thing   but brain dead slop is another matter altogether    tango & cash has   lowest common denominator   written all over it    the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l   a   russell plays cash   a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts    stallone plays tango   a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it   he doesn t need the money    in an effort to change his image   stallone goes for a yuppie   gq look in the film   wearing spectacles and three piece suits    the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names    tango & cash is unbearably noisy    for starters   there s harold faltermeyer s annoying synthesized score   which gets old after four notes    to make matters worse   the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars   the more the merrier    in fact   the movie begins with not one but two car chases    there s nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie    screenwriter randy feldman s brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv    his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it   such as stallone s efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual    in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba   even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent  and stallone is no lawrence olivier    it s hard to imagine anyone reading feldman s script and thinking     i want to be in this movie      the film s plot doesn t have one original bone in its body   and  again  you have to point your finger at the screenwriting    feldman s story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book   making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable    they simply could have called it   action movie      every character   every twist and turn   is stolen from television or from other movies    adding insult to injury   tango & cash is about as believable as a   road runner   cartoon    action movies don t have to be realistic   but they should absorb you enough so that you re not thinking about the lack of realism    the only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography    there are some spectacular shots   especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires    the film s main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell    unfortunately   their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants    the dialogue consists of nothing but one liners   and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing    it s a shame because with a workable screenplay   russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming   lethal weaponesque   adventure    tango & cash tries to maintain a light tone   and you do laugh about once every five minutes    seeing russell in drag is the movie s funniest moment   but you probably already have seen it in the commercials    furthermore   the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence    machine guns and torture generally don t mix well with comedy    jack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best   playing a sleazy   conniving villain    his character   however   is run of the mill   except for his strange obsession with mice    like many movie villains   palance likes to play games    in fact   he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash   a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room    you have to wonder why palance doesn t just shoot the detectives in the head !  the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent    teri hatcher plays stallone s sister and russell s love interest   and she is just as pretty as can be    but regrettably   hatcher s acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty    every time she opens her mouth   you cringe   corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination    there s really very little   if anything   to recommend in the film    and   more to the point   tango definitely isn t worth a penny of your cash  so don t bother

Pos, bruce willis and sixth sense director m   night shyamalan re team to tell the story of david dunne   willis     a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child    on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job   dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of    to make things even stranger   dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed    a comic book art dealer named elijah price   samuel l   jackson     who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly   has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life    price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him        someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break    price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child    dunne doesn t believe him at first   but price assists him in discovering his   powers   and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is    writer/director m   night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense    how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years    for shyamalan   the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners    does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash   though    the answer to that question is not a very easy one   either    as far as pacing goes   the sixth sense seemed almost interminable    it wasn t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally   and perfectly   paced in order to give the audience ample time to re connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached    for unbreakable   shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which   in many ways   blows away the film that had come before    the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan s direction is excellent   with the camera almost constantly moving    there are tons of great shots in the film   not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis  character and another train passenger    the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak    also very impressive is the film s score by james newton howard   who also scored shyamalan s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes   as well as this year s dinosaur      several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film    one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to   exercise   his powers    the music   in combination with the stellar visuals   really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie    if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year   this one would be it    the film also boasts some great performances   including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment    willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne   who just can t seem to figure out why he s been depressed for the last few years    his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him   but he eventually grows into his own under elijah s tutelage    jackson is one of the better actors of our time   and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah    though his hairstyle is absurd   jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked    robin wright penn s role seems slightly underwritten   but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again    spencer treat clark   as the dunne s young son jeremy   shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors   and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film    out of all the characters   jeremy s is perhaps the most emotional   and clark does a great job with the role    where the film does lose points though   is during its   surprise   ending    shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense   but i found myself saying   that was it   !    when unbreakable revealed its own ending    it s not that the ending is bad   it s just that the ending doesn t quite have the emotional punch that the other film s did    plus   it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels   and i won t reveal the ending here   but you ll understand what i mean when you see it      essentially   what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable    the only real problem is that the ending doesn t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor    as long as it isn t held to the standard that sixth sense set   which it ultimately will be     it should be a remarkably well liked film    one thing seems clear   though    shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film    
Pos, capsule   this is a film that avoids easy answers    wilhelm furtwangler   then the world s greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis    what were his views   was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter    how much did he know about crimes against humanity    the us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation       high +2    4 to +4    in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo s sunshine   a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes   hungarian aristocrats   nazis   and communists    szabo s follow up film   a german production   is much more limited in scope    it is about the post war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them    ronald harwood s screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich    maj   steve arnold   played by harvey keitel   has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler   stellan skarsgard     perhaps europe s greatest classical music conductor    when other artists fled germany   furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen    after the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes    he secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty    from there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra    as he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation    there is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting    perhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed    if so   perhaps he can never come to the truth    in large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler    where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous    it has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act    when it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation    perhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe   but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is    we are given clues to something but they are never tied up    in the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler    the film is basically a stage play    the visual is not very important    corners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location    as with a stage play   what this film centers on the dialog   and that is intriguing    i rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the  4 to +4 scale    [there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice    at one point we clearly see arnold s desk calendar say   jan 16 tues      a quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 and then not again until 1951    the events had to take place in 1946 or 1947    a possible date could be obtained from any world almanac   ]

Pos, he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment   raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother    she inspires his love and his fear   and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus    he has a rudimentary grasp of language   mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother s phrases    he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous   his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door    he is 35 years old in body   but a child in mind and spirit    he is the premise for bad boy bubby   a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby   nicholas hope   who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment   etc     etc   then one day his father   ralph cotterill   appears    his father is a shabby down at heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion    unsurprisingly   he is not thrilled with the way   his   boy has turned out    he is   however   rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother   claire benito     and   more to the point   her ample breasts    soon they are copulating on the dingy couch   while bubby crouches   confused   in the next room   acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest    bubby s relationship to the world may be warped   but it is at least stable    the father s arrival disturbs his precarious balance   causing an oedipal conflict which ends  freud would be pleased  in violence and   as a result   freedom    bubby intuits from his father s arrival that the air outside is breathable   he leaves the apartment   his past   his world   behind    so far   so good    the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby   which bring us to this point   are quite brilliant    the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby s hermetic two room universe    it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise   bubby is used by his mother for sex   he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane   he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins    it is grim and savage and appalling   but also strangely tender  de heer   having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby s   does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes   but simply empathizes    he observes what it might be like    the intensity of these opening scenes   with their minimalist mise en scene   immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world   and owes much to david lynch s eraserhead   not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack    for thirty minutes   the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own    then de heer lets bubby out   brings him into contact with our world   and the film never quite recovers    our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide   where he wanders the streets and meets people   where he suffers and learns and survives    he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band   how an anti social half wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages   wisely     he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress   he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach   he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group   he is imprisoned and raped   he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension   he is loved by a motherly large breasted nurse   carmel johnson              it goes on   by turns inventive   silly   tasteless   endearing   and sometimes all of these things at once    de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world   the tone shifts   uneasily   from fable to realism to satire and back again    the scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest   the film is best understood as a kind of parable   and   indeed   the religious implications of bubby s experiences are foregrounded   icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother s walls   bubby dons a priest s collar stolen from his father   a church organ playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief   the woman who redeems him is named angel    the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby s mind   do not fragment him into psychosis   rather   the world accomodates him   and heals him    although de heer s touch is at times overbearing   bubby s salvation is touching   what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na   ve humanist tale of improbable hope    a hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community    he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman   turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art   and turning the band into a popular draw    innocence triumphs    bubby becomes a holy fool   an idiot savant   and graces us with

Neg, i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films    when done right   with at least slightly evident restraint   they can be engaging   sweeping   appealing    but it s a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle   a hollow   boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers   the ones willing to buy into ephron s whiny views of life and romance    tom hanks and meg ryan   two of hollywood s most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed   repectively    baldwin s wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son   jonah   seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse    jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems    sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show   but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out    ephron has him do this so that annie reed   meg ryan   can hear it    annie is a happy woman    she is engaged to walter   an allergy prone working man and seems to be perfectly content    but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show   she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it    five years after this movie hit theaters   hanks   ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better   although still sub par romantic comedy you ve got mail   which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet    at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity    here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five    the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory    sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers   from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie o donnell    but none of them can save the film from being a bore    its characters are dull and empty   its script isn t funny or particularly charming    the script has a fundamental problem   annie gives up   for little reason   her life with walter to pursue   sleepless in seattle     whom she has never even seen    it s the kind of life decision that real people don t make   and its a major   unforgivable plausibility sacrifice    in essence   this movie s purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldn t even exist    it s a ten minute short film with ninety five minutes of filler    if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didn t have to review it   you could just call me   asleep in philadelphia         1999 eugene novikov&#137    
Neg, i ve got to admit it        i m a huge jim carrey fan    i loved the first ace ventura   as well as the mask and dumb and dumber  and even in batman forever   which was a pretty awful movie     carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good    until i saw ace ventura 2   i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying    sadly   ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be    carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie   but this time it is no longer funny  it is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i    the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon   in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof      soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and   if not returned in four days   will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other    once again   it s up to ace to save the day   using his uncanny detective skills    those who have been disappointed by carrey s more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over acting to the best of his ability   but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesn t capture the feel of the original    the original benefited from what looked to be carrey s constant hyped up improv sequences   which were hysterically funny    here   however   the tighter script   which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies   takes the improvised material from the first   and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie   giving carrey little chance to improvise    instead   his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly    but one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself    in the first movie   he was always cool   and one step ahead of every one else  perfect for carrey s off the wall approach    but here   ventura is made to look a lot stupider   and is often made out as the straight guy  a role which is definitely not carrey s style    there are definitely some very funny moments   but they are few and far between    they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura   or even dumb and dumber    
Pos, in chocolat   a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures   patterns   and lines   hoping she ll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they ll most enjoy    some scoff the idea   but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next   revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before    this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole   on the surface   it appears to be a light   fluffy fable with no depth or true worth   but when one takes a second   deeper look   chocolat s true colors begin to shine through    making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it   lasse hallstrom s chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted not to mention one of the best films of the year    what gives chocolat its magic   much like hallstrom s 1999 winner of two academy awards   the cider house rules   is its willingness to say what s on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences    the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers   but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow mindedness    chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet   where majority rules   and the majority lives by only one law   religion    the bulk of the townspeople   with few exceptions   are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence   lent   but when the independent thinking   seemingly non religious vianne rocher   juliette binoche   and her daughter anouk   victoire thivisol   make the village their home   the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens    many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent   especially the mayor   comte de reynaud   a cartoon like alfred molina     who will stop at nothing to put her out of business    on the other hand   the shop is a delight to others   including the cranky armande voizin   judi dench     who sits day by day in vianne s shop   telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson   aurelien parent koening     which comes as a result of his mother   carrie ann moss   believing armande is a bad influence   as she does not hold the same   strict religious beliefs that she does    also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat   whose husband is constantly beating her   to whom vianne offers a home and befriends    juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne   genuinely capturing her character s determination to turn the narrow minded townspeople into more happy   independent human beings   but most of chocolat s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses    lena olin   previously nominated for an oscar in 1989   deserves her second nomination for her earnest   moving portrayal of a lost   scared woman torn between staying true to her battering   manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs    judi dench is sharp   incisive   and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin    carrie ann moss   in what is likely to be her first largely noticed   and acclaimed   role since the matrix   shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen   crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously    victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk   a young girl hoping her always on the move mother will eventually settle down    a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline     five extraordinary women   one extraordinary movie      that s not to say the men don t do their share   though   alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist   hugh o conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is   and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux   who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne    the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board   lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care   perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film    cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric   fairy tale look to the film   and rachel portman s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules    chocolat   adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel   is a wonderful little treat of a film   one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter   and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter    while not as powerful as the cider house rules   lasse hallstrom s chocolat is a film which works on all levels as a drama   a comedy   a fable   a romance   and a fairy tale    and it even lives up to its name   it is delicious to savor the taste of   easy to digest   and   like all excellent chocolate   it is memorable for days afterward    the bottom line   chocolat is pure pleasure

Neg, instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as   powerful   or   touching      i have a name for it myself     gross      this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully   the bully looks at the   rebel   threateningly   about to hurt him   and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too    how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me   aren t present day moviegoers beyond being   inspired   by something like that    this is one example   there are actually some more in instinct alone   of filmmakers insulting the audience s intelligence    instinct s plot is brimming with potential   world renowned anthropologist ethan powell   anthony hopkins   disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa    he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer   he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him    after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport   the authorities stick him in a prison s   psychotics ward      assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright   or so we are told   young psychiatrist theo caulder   cuba gooding jr        caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career    of course   and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way   he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison    and then there s the inevitable   heartless meanie   character   in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder s mentor    he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell    let s get one thing straight   dr   theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen   on screen or off    any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way    not good old theo    no   he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says   we need to talk about this right now      this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct s already dubious credibility   unfortunately it s also the least of its problems    director jon turteltaub   who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that   contrary to what this movie s promotion would have you believe   it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs    it s not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes   what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that   but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus   excuse the graphic depiction      it aims to   inspire   rather than to touch hearts    as yoda would say   inspire it does not    it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter   the very experienced gerald di pego   has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie s story    indeed   somewhere in the beginning of instinct   one of the characters actually reads aloud the film s plot to another character    this   like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review   is a horrid insult to our intelligence    i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation    i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors   and he chews the scenery in this movie   brilliant as ever    oscar winner cuba gooding jr   on the other hand is dreadful    his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink    i liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling    i love animals   and instinct s prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with    however this movie s execution is completely unacceptable    tone down the violence and this will be a chick flick       1999 eugene novikov  
Pos, john sayles    men with guns   is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power    the film takes place in an unnamed central american country   where the men with guns are the rulers    most of the country is divided into tiny segments   some are controlled by guerrillas with guns   some are controlled by army soldiers with guns   and all the spaces in between are controlled by thieves   bandits   and terrorists    all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness    however   like so many central american countries   this one also features modernity    there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization   skyscrapers   hospitals   televisions   highways   etc   but   it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land   or else they are simply ignorant of it    the film s main character   dr   fuentes   federico luppi   falls into the latter category    one of his patients   an army general   describes him as the most educated man he has ever met   and also the most naive    fuentes is a true liberal   a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians    with government assistance   he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate    this program was to be his legacy   and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea    however   when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot   g   s   he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned    as he travels deeper into the forest   going from village to village   the story is always the same   the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers   usually for helping the other    when dr   fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors   she replies simply     because they had guns   and we didn t      rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns   because others  sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power    dr   fuentes picks up several companions during his journey   all of whom are characterized by their loss    first   there is a young boy named conejo   dan rivera gonz   lez     who has neither a mother nor a father    next   fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo   dami   n delgado     who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities    through his ordeal in the army   domingo has lost most of his self respect   and defines himself only by his pistol    along the way   the group also picks up padre portillo   dami   n alc   zar     a priest who has lost his faith    as domingo is running from the army   so is portillo   he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer   and ran away from the village in which he was preaching    last   the group takes on a mute girl named graciela   tania cruz     who hasn t spoken since she was raped two years earlier   her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her    sayles two major strengths as a director   characters and setting   are abundantly evident in   men with guns         like many of his films   sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room   but a longer than necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor      he creates fascinating   complex characters   especially dr   fuentes and domingo    their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film s overarching theme of violence as power   domingo s attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes  belief that the revolver is unloaded   at first it is   but later is isn t      the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself    sayles knows how to bring a location to life   whether it be an early twentieth century coal mining town in   matewan     1987   or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in   lone star     1996      sayles is not a particularly inventive director   he likes to let his actors do most of the work   but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak     gattaca     successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain    sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico   using all latin american actors   and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects    the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief   but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border    it would not be a stretch to say that   men with guns   is a depressing film    in fact   the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure    in addition to loss   the main characters are also failures at something   whether that be dr   fuentes failure to change anything through medicine   or padre portillo s inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being    nevertheless   it is bleak material sayles has chosen   and he deals with it accordingly    the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope   even in a world where   as one character puts it     nobody refuses the men with guns      
Pos, okay   let me first say   this is a beavis and butthead movie    if you do not like beavis and butthead   do not go to see this movie ! ! ! ! !  however   if you do like them   i recommened you get out right now and go see it    the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv    they notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it    this wind their way through america searching for dallas   she is a woman      they look for her because as they are searching for the tv   they find a drunk who wants them   to do   his wife    well   of course they think he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her    and the fun starts their    this movie is a mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off    it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy    i enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace    even when they were crawling through the desert and i thought the movie started to lag   he manages to keep the laughs coming    if you expecting changes from the show keep looking    the same character   the same voices   the same everything from the show and that s what makes it good    you might think with a movie from a tv show   you can change a few things    often times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place !  
Pos, one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable    you know   the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information   and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is    sure   it s been used over and over   but for some reason   it is always fun to watch    this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on   overused   but always fun    one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is   but how it goes around giving its story    this rule applies highly to kiss the girls    there is something psychologically stimulating in a well crafted serial killer movie   and kiss the girls is certainly well made    however   the whole film screams of unoriginality   and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through    well   not only are the actors capable of pulling it through   but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up    unfortunately   one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers   one that seven   a film a lot like this one   knew not to make   was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits    that may give the actor credit for the role   but throughout the film   hidden in my mind   i was waiting for him to appear on screen   which spoiled the mystery    however   credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film    plotwise   kiss the girls shows almost no originality    we are introduced to detective alex cross   morgan freeman     a forensic psychologist   and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero    he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself    obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun   but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene    at his house   cross is told that his neice   naomi   gina ravera     has been missing for four days    this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer   but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two   and as a result   we can t sympathize with detective cross    however   what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees        before she is abducted    dr   kate mctiernan   ashley judd   the actress of the judd family   is a smart   athletic woman   and because of these traits   becomes a target for casanova  what the serial killer likes to call himself    because of these character developing scenes   we care for mctiernan   making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful    after being abducted   mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods    remembering that the killer gave her certain rules   she decides to break one of them by calling out    when casanova comes to punish her   she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall    after she is found   she begins to help cross find his neice    from this moment on   kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film   as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive    many people will compare this film to 1995 s seven   another killer film starring morgan freeman   but i presume that the similarities are intentional    the screenplay   by david klass   is adapted from the novel written by james patterson   and yet i don t quite see how this story could have worked in novel form    what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness    the cinematography   by aaron schneider   is reminiscient of seven   and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us    sometimes a simple shot is the best one    however   many of the shots are stunning   and unlike seven   most of them take place during the day   in sunlight    the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done   in more than one way    the camera work is terrific   but the editing makes this scene work so well    the chaotic and mtv type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness   exactly what judd s character is experiencing    however   the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors    morgan freeman is one of today s most powerful and believable actors    detective cross is a very good character for him   although it is just a similar one to the character in seven    because of freeman s powerful presence   he carries half the film by himself    the other half is carried by ashley judd   one of today s most promising dramatic actresses    in fact   her performance is better than freeman s   if that is even possible    her character is more original than freeman s   and she handles it wonderfully    we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream    the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped   but the cast members do as much as they can with it    cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina   and unfortunately has scraps for a character    tony goldwyn fairs slightly better   but we don t really get to know his character either    gina ravera gives a good performance   but again she isn t in many of the scenes    so as a result of all these small supporting parts   the weight of the film lies on the two leads   and they do a phenomenal job    some of the best acting of this genre   and some of the best acting of the year    two other essential aspects of the film are quite good    director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors   but the second half of the film loses believability   especially during the revelation of the killer    he also doesn t handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have   losing a lot of tension during many scenes    however   to his credit   he does manage a terrific first half    part of the blame falls on david klass    i m sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more   but klass focuses on the two main parts    while this may give the two leads more screentime   many of the small characters are one dimensional   and the killer   when revealed   is extremely implausible    thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel   kiss the girls always seems intelligent    none of the conversations are laughable   and all move the plot forward without seeming forced    one of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer    i blame this mainly on the casting director   because the killer s motive is because of rejection from women   or so i assume from the opening monologue     but the killer himself is very attractive   one of my friends is a   shall we say   big admirer of the killer      kiss the girls is rated r for terror   violence   language   and suggested sex    with all the implausibilities of this film   and with the mediocre second half   kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain    in fact   i had the urge to see it again just for the performances    the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone   and the script is usually smart    this is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through    morgan freeman is possibly today s most convincing actor   and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt    i must also say that i loved the ending    the showdown between good and evil was quite tense   and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer    perhaps it may not be possible   but most of the film isn t anyway

with the mafia and the sleek   ultra cool   cinematic image of the hitman    juxtaposing the samurai s honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia   it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor s precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber   dinosaur like   to function in the modern era    director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast   ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit    using a palate of bleached colors   jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film    he doesn t cater to audience expectations of hyper colorized   stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies    the action is presented in flat   brutal codas    bullets have permanence    death has consequences    the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty    it is an anti movie   of sorts    there are few photogenic   empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with    this isn t a film that lovingly holds your hand    there are dark   contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder   just so   asserting itself for all to see    the fulcrum for the movie s thematic balancing act is ghost dog   a mafia hitman    a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer   ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms    unlike the sleek   muscular killing machines one is accustomed to   we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly   replete with chapped   dirty hands and rumpled clothing    he wears a hooded sweatshirt   which he often pulls over his head   giving him a monk like appearance    there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal    he uses old   worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical   efficient and pleasureless fashion    ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai   distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book   which he reads daily   hagakure   the way of the samurai    life consists of simple pleasures for him   ice cream   warm rooftop naps and good books    ghost dog lives   as it were   by the basic tenet expressed by his book   one should start each day considering oneself as dead    living atop an abandoned building   surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons   ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends    he craves nothing more    as he puts it late in the film     i ve seen all i want to see      he exists in a spiritual world of the mind   gaining moral sustenance from his readings    ghost dog wasn t always as he is presented    in several roshomon like flashbacks   it s shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan   that   samaritan   being a foot soldier in an aging crime family    ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man   louie   tormey     as repayment    after years of loyal service   ghost dog is sent   by louie   to kill   handsome frank     a made man within louie s organization who has run away with the crime boss s daughter   louise   vessey      ghost dog wordlessly executes his task   witnessed by louise   whom he spares   as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon   clutching a copy of the book   roshomon    in a bit of synchronicity   louise loans the book to ghost dog    upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family   the mob bosses   in turn   put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade    the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict    the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again   each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog s world    each time a character is shown watching a cartoon   it s from the same era   betty boop   felix the cat   etc     a reflection of days gone by    near the end   louise is watching a cartoon that s a departure from the previously shown ones    it s a bit of audacity on jarmusch s part that is nicely effective   despite it s surrealistic nature    as ghost dog floats through his world   his life is touched by two people    one is a sage little girl   winbush   who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading    she comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities   just as louise ultimately does    by film s end   the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer    the other person in ghost dog s world is an ice cream   de bankole    vendor who only speaks french   yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog    the vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land    jarmusch   through rapper/composer rza   underscores his film with rap and reggae music   which at first blush seems dichotomous   but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie    ghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars       which   in and of itself   presents another paradox about ghost s dog s sense of honor      the head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation    of all the cartoonish mobsters   he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world    gorman plays sonny   a lieutenant who respects the old ways   yet has a quirky affinity for rap music   a love comically shown in several impromptu displays    ruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia    he is a husk of a man   assisted by two hearing aids   who barks out advice without truly hearing what he   or others are saying    whitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor s use   his face    ghost dog is reticent to speak   often going for long periods without doing so    the fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent    although the film has a deliberate pace   some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down    truly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob    he reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world    carried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker   ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon   into a figure that garners sympathy   if not a bit of pity    
Pos, seen july 8   1998 at the crossgates cinema 18     albany   ny     theater #7   at 8   15 p   m   with my mom using hoyts cinema cash    [theater rating   * * * 1/2   very good sound   picture   and seats]  it s very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic   vivid sense of reality and life    all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters  lives   but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do    therefore     gone with the wind   deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does   in such a crafted   intricate   and entertaining manner    it s a crowning achievement   not only in filmmaking   but for storytelling itself    the film takes place in georgia before   during   and after the civil war    this plays a major factor in the film s success    to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy    it might also seem cliche   boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers    can a story set so long ago be relatable now    the film confronts all these problems   paradoxically   by not cronfronting them    it doesn t simply plug in the   right thing   at the   right time     it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant    building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media   without which   what is there to build on    we re given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters   especially our main character   scarlett o hara   leigh     a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel   a cunning wit   and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time    she knows how her society works   wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her    right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be    being the most sought after woman allows her to manipulate men   and their women   to ensure she gets her way   whether it be obvious   i   e    who will be the one to get her food     or subtle   i   e    getting married just to spite someone      the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes   howard     a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him    he isn t so arrogant and demanding as scarlett   in fact   he s engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his    her name is melanie   de havilland     and she is one of the sweetest   kindest   and most likable characters one will ever see    she and scarlett become very dear friends   but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her   and the love she has for her husband    her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic   it defines who she is   but doesn t give her much emotional self defense    acting a catalyst to the love triangle   and to the story as a whole is the daper   stong willed   cunning   cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler   gable      he s quite a character all right   everyone listens to what he has to say even though he s got a bad reputation    butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior    he tells everyone the much needed truth in the rigid caste like society where freewill doesn t seem to exist   everything is done out of honor and tradition    for example   in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out    this angers them   not for his lack of faith   but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that       do we have ammunition factories    do we have food    do we have a navy    all we have is tobacco      all true statements and yet the south still insists he s wrong    butler is a shifty character to be sure   but he takes such pride in his arrogance it s appealing    scarlett notices this too when she first sees him   and from the look butler gives her   we know he s not going to stop until he has her    but scarlett can t get past her need for ashley   and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story   butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever    and so the story goes on   with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life    the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband   especially after she is   marked   for life when her first husband dies    this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story    some are vital for only a few scenes   but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film    in most films only a few characters exist for support in background   but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance    even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set    the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place    the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside   real world   but these types of simple approaches are never taken    the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war    fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is    one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming     no !  not my leg !  don t cut off my leg !    another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street   but as the camera pulls back   we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers   but it is their moaning that s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be    as the second half begins   the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north    she manages to resurrect the family plantation   but all the willpower she has can t help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south s ultimate defeat    this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love  hate relationship    most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship   or lack thereof   between rhett and scarlett    each uses the other for personal gain   but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other    scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can t help but want her more every time she tries to one up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business    they say opposites attract   but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities   it borders on magnetic polarization    they need each other and know this   yet they never seem truly happy together    perhaps they mistake love for passion   and the film leaves it up to us to make this call    both have things the other wants and vice versa   but when they compromise   is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other    love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film   we re left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why    gable and leigh do have great chemistry   always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture    all    none    either way is possible and it s a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings    it s safe to say most of us won t live such overly dramatic lives as those in   gone with the wind     but it s still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we ve just experienced a life s worth of joy and pain    
Pos, showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven   director   and joe eszterhas   writer    their last effort   basic instinct   played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock   with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry spiced tabasco sauce   a dish not to everyone s taste   but certainly a well crafted movie    possibly that movie s greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage   prior to the movie   during the movie   and after the movie        and that   after bringing all the plotlines together neatly   it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters  future   so there was no need to film it    there was actually about four hours  worth of screen story there   but eszterhas found ways to get it all on screen in two   by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on   and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails    the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls    we have attractive   sympathetic   but still highly repellent characters   we have shows for the eyes and the ears   plotlines that play on several levels   we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable   and we have a story of an innocent   who may not be so innocent   who s trying to play straight   trying to improve her station in life   who slips into behaving the way those around her do        but recovers with a flourish   and quits a winner    in this sense   the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven   who s not known for treating his characters well   but nomi   the part played by elizabeth berkley   definitely opts out of the game in a positive way   and we re left feeling good about her future    this is not one of the great movies   but it s far better than we d been led to expect by all the negative pre release publicity    verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971   and in the last quarter century has pushed farther and farther   experimenting with the socially acceptable limits to movie making    his most recent three movies   robocop   total recall   and basic instinct   have been a progression of back door access to american culture   moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives   and now he s exploring the sleeze    this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie       verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating   although his original version is available on video      many reviewers have taken the politically correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing   but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies   it s about people in an environment where naked ladies are common   and why such an environment should exist    it s about the scum who use other people as power trip toys   and the need to escape their power    it s about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don t pertain   and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment    an nc 17 movie which isn t sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty   power   or value    the one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene   berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool   is not exciting   because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator    if anything   it s a rape scene with a victim who s been duped into cooperation    you don t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors   you don t make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed   and you don t make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls        and in an awful lot of vegas shows   an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing    this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry   in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity    showgirls de glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness    nomi is played   in a very good performance   by elizabeth berkley   who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who s at the end of her rope   desperate to live a life better than the one she s known    she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability   and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker   trying to be something better than she seems destined to be    when nomi realizes she s gone too far for too little   she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be    gina rivera plays molly   a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi   providing her with what may be the one solid   positive relationship in nomi s entire life    molly is the one who makes the difference   and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she ll be using for the rest of her life   and nomi s feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi s decision    gina gershon plays cristal   an aging   but still very attractive starring dancer   a reflexively competitive manipulator who s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her    gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch   a fading talent made bitter by self awareness    her character is very well drawn and performed   in a major scene in a hospital room   she acknowledges what she is   and   in essence   passes the torch to nomi    the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie   and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path    it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe   molly is an honest   hard working person who means well   and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality    cristal is a talented dancer who s compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co operating part of the system   exchanging self respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas    nomi believes she can make it without selling herself   succumbs to a degree   and then realizes she can make it without selling herself   and doesn t need las vegas or its brand of   stardom      the male parts in this movie are simply props   they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist    kyle maclachlan   whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden   gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs   camouflaged as a nice guy    glenn plummer plays a dancer who s working as a bellboy   and provides a bit of alternate perspective    plummer s character is the only one in the movie who s maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art   but even he s succumbed to the cult of manipulation    plummer s character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie    some of jost vacano s cinematography is fantastic   and one particular delineation of nomi s character alteration   a no dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting   is utterly terrifying    this movie is rated nc 17 due to language   sexual situations   full frontal nudity   violence   and probably the costuming as well    i don t see a way this particular story could have been told well without it   and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie making    but don t go see it if you re not in a tough mood   the only person it s possible to like in this movie ends up in an i   c   u    on life support   and there is probably not one character in this movie you d enjoy meeting in person    
Neg, the above is dialogue from this film   taken almost completely in context   and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is    it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film   and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about   especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously    mr   gregg   i m having a mid life crisis   araki   the writer and director of this film   wants to show how important teenagers are   and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible   horrible world    and how does he show it    by really cheap surrealism   and moronic exchanges like this    oh   and it gets better    a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of   oh i dunno   the fiftieth sex scene in this film   i m not counting the several masturbation scenes      in it   one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another   and he says to her something along the lines of   do you ever wonder what life is all about      sorry   man   foreplay takes place before the act of coitus    of course   what do you expect   the film was written and directed by a guy who can t even spell his first name right   yes   i know it s a cheap joke   but it had to be done         the doom generation   is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them   and also as another   teen angst   film   one of the slogans is   teen is a four letter word     hardy har har      it s a film about two angsty teens   amy blue   rose macgowan   who would later play the buxom tatum in   scream     and jordon white   james duval   who would go on to play randy quaid s son in   independence day       who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac   xavier red   jonathan schaech   who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in   that thing you do !      and by the way   do you get the symbolism    red   white   and blue    huh    huh       and go on a road trip where three things happen   in no order   1   they have sex   2   they run into weird people   3   they kill them    the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films    gregg araki obviously has seen such films as   easy rider       natural born killers     and   kalifornia     and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide    but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not   or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper       the doom generation   doesn t want to do this   it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level    he wants to show everything in a weird manner   and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about    here s one scene   an earlier scene in the film   amy and jordan go into a quick e mart type place to get food and other stuff    amy is smoking   and the clerk   an asian man mind you   i love how racist this film is   i really do     tells her to put it out    she tells him to fuck off or something to that note    he points a shotgun at her   and she puts it out reluctantly    jordan makes two hot dogs   and takes them to the counter    the cash register rings up   6   66       oh   and this symbolism doesn t stop here      jordan checks for his wallet but it s really in the car    he asks amy for it   but she left her wallet in the car as well    the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money    they say they don t have it    he gets ready to kill them   but then xavier   who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before   pops out of nowhere   fights with the clerk   and ends with him blowing the clerk s head clean off   clean wound   mind you      the head is shown flying through the air   and lands in a fryer   where it begins to scream    i don t really object to this kind of sick violence   but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only   to gross you out    araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme   he ll make some kind of art    wrong    it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art    when george romero made   dawn of the dead     a very gory flick even for today   he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick    same goes for peter jackson s disgustingly gory   dead alive     which features a 30 minute long fest of blood   guts   dismemberments   flesh chewing   and other assorted stuff   all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body   taking out all sorts of zombies    it was sick   but it was also satirical   and controled    a scene like this has no purpose in the film   and it sticks out from everything else that happens    here s a couple other scenes   jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches   masturbates   and then licks the semen from his hand   xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window   masturbates   and falls backwards   a man attacks the trio   and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword   put there just so this could happen     a fast food employee stalks the trio   and his arm is shot off by xavier   and various other annoyances    also   look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people   who probably didn t really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it   just like peter o toole   helen mirren   malcolm macdowell   and john gielgud probably didn t when they signed to be in   caligula        people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt   alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel   hollywood madam heidi fleiss   christopher   peter brady   mcknight   amanda bearse   and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds   then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line    why are they here    so that we can all point to them and say   hey   look it s   fill in the blank   !  wow !    gimme a break    the film s meaning is pretty easy to detect   that   you know   teens are so precious   and the world is such a horrible place   that when the two entities collide   there s a giant explosion of horrific violence    otherwise defined as   teen angst     or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you    look   i m 19 years old    i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did    i ve since moved on to   i don t really know what to do with my life   phase   but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they re dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse    part of being a teen is experimenting   and testing the waters    it s not whining about how awful parents are   and purposely feeling dispondent    this is what the characters in this film do   and the film wants to show how they re these great people who are being punished by the world because they re teenagers   and how they try to defend themselves but can t totally overcome them    it s not their fault they kill people   it s the world s !  what they really need is a reality check    the world is a bad place   and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting    but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it    the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed   and there s nothing they can do about it    hence the title    not only does it have bad fallacy   but it can t even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner    everything s overly surreal   and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex    how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst    how does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way    and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film    if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction   he d show them for what they really are    and if he didn t want the satirical approach   he d show the real problems with the world    and if you still don t think that   the doom generation   is incompetent on every single possible level it could be   take the acting    rose macgowan is horrible    yes   she proved herself talented in   scream     but she s so bad in   the doom generation   that if i had not seen her in   scream     i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today    her entire performance is one note   bitchy     and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it s laughable    equally bad is jonathan schaech   who wants to be the slacker serial killer   someone who doesn t have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain    his performance is annoying as hell   and granted   he was better in   that thing you do !    and then there s james duval    let s just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando    he has the same kind of slacker stuttering   only much much much worse   and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him   least talented actor in the world      i have seen lots of bad actors   but james duval has got to be the worst    or at least somewhere up there    here s another example of a bad scene   if you re still not convinced   the film opens up in a club where they re playing nine inch nail s most banal song     heresy     example of the lines     god is dead/and no one cares/if there is a hell/i ll see you there       and as the song plays   and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing   the film pans over to amy   just standing there   looking dispondent    the film closes in on her   she looks right at the camera and says   fuck      no explanation of this should be necessary    and finally   a note to gregg   grow up    really    move out of your parent s basement   read something other than salinger   and get a day job    and don t quit it    
Pos, the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now     it mu5t be found      so what   exactly   is the fifth element    after seeing luc besson s ambitious   much shrouded in secrecy science fiction fantasy   i could not help but be let down by the actual answer   which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think    but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole   a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do  create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen    the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps  the actual storyline  is the most conventional   dismayingly so   element   pun intended   of the film    speaking in the vaguest possible terms   the basics of the plot are as follows   in the year 2259   a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth   and only the four elements  earth   wind   fire   and water  united with a fifth element can stop it    figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas   bruce willis     a shady   southern drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg   the hilariously hammy gary oldman   picking up where he left off in besson s the professional     a priest   ian holm     and a mysterious creature named leeloo   milla jovovich      all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming  and unsurprising  fashion   but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest    what remains interesting and exciting   however   after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil   director of photography thierry arbogast   visual effects supervisor mark stetson   and the crew at digital domain    the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last    the frenzied cityscape of new york   with its vibrant day glo colors   tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds   and the swarm of cars   cabs   and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways   is absolutely breathtaking to behold   especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film    but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren t equally as interesting   and are they ever    in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world   from bulky robots to dog like mangalores   the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean paul gaulthier   best known for creating madonna s pointy bustier get up in her blonde ambition tour    gaulthier s outlandish creations   such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps   feel more at home in besson s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world   they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film    while besson s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film   it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience    for all its imagination   certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre    i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film   ruby rhod   chris tucker     a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative  he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress   sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer   speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed    at first this character s hyper energy is funny   but the act wears out its welcome very quickly    not irritating   but just as strange   is a musical number by blue skinned alien chanteuse diva   maiwenn lebesco     who sings  and dances  an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno    the tune   as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra s innovative score   is haunting   but it is also completely jarring    then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout   which too often are silly and forced   a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny   to boot    the story s weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element    while still visually and aurally spectacular   the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be    the big   serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers   and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward    as such   at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here   that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters    this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself   who told me in the lobby following the screening   imagine that   the filmmaker watching the film with the   enemy     the critics   that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half  now titled mr   shadow  is still waiting to be made    still   despite the story problems   the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson   rarely does a filmmaker s original vision come to the screen in all its audacious   undiluted glory    it is a fascinating example of how of one artist s fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams    
Neg, the formula is simple    trap a varied group of people on an isolated location   then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one    these have been the successful ingredients for many good films   the thing   alien   aliens   and tremors to name a few      so   why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad       see the relic for a particularly putrid example      perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient   effort and ideas    deep rising meets these two requirements part way   but not enough to salvage the film    treat williams is finnegan   the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services   and their boat   for any activity       no  questions asked    this time   however   they may have gone too far    their passengers   led by the ominous wes studi   are the type of multi national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films    and their cargo       let s  just say it has very high explosive potential    what is the target of these thieves    why   the argonauticus   of course   a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage    but something else is hunting the argonauticus       something  ancient and deadly    by the time the thieves arrive   nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed    and now the creature senses fresh meat !  so   you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew   joining forces with the surviving passengers   including the ship owner canton   anthony heald     and a thief with less lofty goals   trillian   famke janssen     against the terror from the deep    and the monster gets to pick them off one by one    fortunately for the creature   this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer    why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food    if there s a more clarion call for unity   i don t know what it might be    it s pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when    there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end    for the most part   the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience s impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first       although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou s life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad      treat williams is a passable hero   and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation    but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy   very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way    the biggest treat in the film   however   has to be pantucci   kevin j   o connor s whining engine boy   under finnegan s employ    his constant quips may be a bit over written   but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens   or todd graff as hippie in the abyss   for that matter      it s just a stock part   the comic relief character     but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable    as far as the monster goes   although the cgi is done well   the creature has no logical consistency    think back to the great   or even just good   movie monsters    they all had a set of   rules   about what they could do   and how and why they would do it    part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering   along with the heroes   just what those rules are    the tentacle monster in deep rising doesn t have a set of rules        or if it does   not a very good one    it merely eats   or drinks   as the case may be     and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so    the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place    it simply happens    the action scenes are decent   but few are noteworthy    the film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic    deep rising s peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron s   but can you really blame them      unfortunately   deep rising s efforts are more on par with speed 2    on the plus side   however   the film s closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting   but unlikely   sequel    perhaps you d be better off waiting for that one    
Pos, the happy bastard s 30 second review  notting hill  a cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral   notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott   a very popular actress with a $15 million asking price for movies    one day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple london resident   played by hugh grant     and sparks somehow begin to fly    sure   there are points of turmoil   such as putting up with grant s slightly disgusting   but very hilarious   roommate spike   anna s pesky ex boyfriend   alec baldwin in a humorous cameo     and   on top of all that   those damn press    it s a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy   very different from   say   a stubborn father or   not the right time   like as seen in usual flicks    roberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress   and grant is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a hold of what has actually happened with this girl    in short   a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs   particularly provided by spike    one tee shirt really says it all about him    in an attempt to turn on a woman   he shows the front of the shirt   which says     you are the most beautiful woman in the world      on the back       fancy a f * * k      
Neg, the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could ve been effective    such is the case with  urban legend    the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks    the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends    examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house    the killer wears one of those l   l   bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up   so you can t see the face    i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days    anyhow   the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric    it s a very good setup that promises more chills to come    unfortunately   the film never takes off from there    the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus    like most slasher flicks   this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac   or in this case an axe wielding maniac      i ve always wondered why these killers don t save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill    after the fine first scene   the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you thought it was the killer but was just  someone else scares    these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music    i guess sudden   sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days    the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast    the slasher appears   attacks   the victim is eviscerated   and the tedious cycle appears anew    false scares should always be used in moderation    someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren t as scary as they used to be    this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit  it s not frightening    remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in  scream  and  scream 2     this movie still adheres to them    tons of illogical moments about   more than i really have the inclination to list    and i don t mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense    that type of illogical can be fun    this film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember    the last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you ll be laughing more than you ll be screaming    actually   you won t be screaming at all    at its best   the acting can barely be called   adequate   and the script could ve definitely used a rewrite or two    the film still manages to have some strong points    the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans    there are some intentionally funny moments       these were exceeded by the unintentional ones      the film is well made from a technical standpoint    besides the first part   there is also another good scene   a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station    if there had only been more sequences like this   that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music    urban legend  might ve been worth your money    
Pos, uncompromising french director robert bresson s   lancelot of the lake   achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory s   morte darthur      instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table   it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak   ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous   bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them    chivalry has no place in   lancelot of the lake     except as that of a dying ideal    bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning   decimated   after failing merlin s command to retrieve the holy grail   the mystical cup that was filled with christ s blood    bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest   bloodshed and failure    the opening sequence is a series of clumsy   disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights    a head is hacked off   a stomach is impaled   a skull is split open   skeletal remains hang from trees   and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house    since the film starts with camelot in near ruin   and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion   it doesn t carry the grand   tragic resonance of other arthurian films    we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power   therefore there is no real downfall to witness    but   then again   it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film    rather   it is lancelot   and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart   than the external downfall of a kingdom    lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales   and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh    the greatest of all knights   he was flawed only in his love for arthur s wife   queen guinevere   and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot    even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere   laura duke condominas     he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment    he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom   but he is powerless in his passion    when sir mordred   patrick bernhard   accuses lancelot of the affair   other knights   including sir gawain   humbert balsan   spring to lancelot s defense    it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table   the flesh wins out over the spirit   and the consequences are dire    bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men s hearts and minds       lancelot of the lake   is filled with his particular trademarks   a stripped down   minimalist style   flat   expressionless dialogue   and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music    he uses background music only twice in the film   during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits    the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes   but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film s thematic elements   the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor   the neighing of horses   the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads   and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest    like most of his other films   bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless   flat voices    all the actors he used in   lancelot of the lake   had never acted before   and with the exception of patrick bernhard   they never acted again    never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word    instead of using vocal inflection   bresson strove to create emotion through images    in some ways   this technique works   in other ways   it doesn t    the final montage of arthur s men battling each other is quite marvelous   and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap pile sums up the entire film in one moment    however   other times bresson s uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable    for instance   during an important jousting contest   bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses  legs    he does this repeatedly   opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag    while there might be symbolic value in this   the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome    nevertheless     lancelot of the lake   is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker    bresson s style may not be for everyone   but one has to respect his strength as an artist    by re evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own   he turns   lancelot of the lake   into something rare in modern cinema   a truly personal film    
Neg, yeah   yeah   the advertisements didn t even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook   sex    neve campbell and starship trooper s denise richards getting it on    ok !  yeah   it s a decent two minutes of film erotica   but even if that s your main interest in this film   there s plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes    wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however    nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing   or at least curious to see the next turn   throughout the entire movie    but this fast paced   razor sharp turning of events doesn t leave much time to enjoy the surprises    we start off in a high class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making    guidance counselor sam lombardo   matt dillon   seems to catch the eye of every student   particularly kelly van ryan   richards     daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts    right off the bat   kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce   mr   lombardo      the fund raiser car wash seems the opportune time   particularly when you wash your guidance counselor s jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you ll be soaked from head to toe when you re done    on the weekend of the car wash   kelly s attempts at seduction fall flat   and when they do   she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day    naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations    but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low class   marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller   campbell   comes forth with a near identical story   also involving her trusted guidance counselor    pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians   sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney   ken bowden   played by bill murray    yes   that bill murray !  sound like a good   complete movie    yes   that alone could have been   but this is just the beginning    in fact   the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film    it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time    by the time the movie finishes   you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable    unfortunately   with so much going on   you re not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about    this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could ve been    the 113 minutes fly by   and although it never feels underdeveloped   this pretzel of storytelling could ve been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken    the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime time soap operas   which no   is not a good thing    and it s not just campbell   who happens to hail from the prime time fox soap   party of five     but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones    dillon   who was so charming in his understated role in last year s in & out   gives the best performance   and murray s surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film    in fact   if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy   even if it was the exact same film   i would actually give it a better grade    that s how cheezy it comes off    but aside from these two   the rest offer nothing more than some good eye full s    in the right hands   wild things could ve been a wickedly delightful   scrumptiously twisted thriller   but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting    and what s up with these people passing as high school students    i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles   but when i realized it wasn t supposed to be a college they were at   i had to snicker    i won t lie   this is definitely a guilty pleasure    as corny as it is   it s got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a   b   for effort    but if you just want to admire denise richards   go for last year s starship troopers   which was every bit as campy   but a million times better    of course   if seeing her breasts is your most important goal   you ll be right at home with wild things    perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters    
Pos,    the faculty     the heavily hyped and advertised sci fi/horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez   1995 s   desperado   and 1996 s   from dusk till dawn     and screenwriter kevin williamson   1996 s   scream   and 1997 s   scream 2       is being called a cross between   invasion of the body snatchers   and   the breakfast club     and i don t think i could describe it any better than that    the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common   and then the science fiction aspect is added   involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town    the six characters   as in   the breakfast club     can be easily labeled as a stereotype   but as they are developed   they become far more complex   casey   elijah wood     the much picked upon nerd   stokely   clea duvall     a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her   zeke   josh hartnett     a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz   stan   shawn hatosy     the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics   delilah   jordanna brewster     the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist   and marybeth   laura harris     the sweet  n southern new girl in town    although the characters are only slightly connected   i   e    casey is delilah s photojournalist assistant   marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely   since they both don t have friends   etc       when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences   the only people they can count on for help is each other   even though they aren t really even sure if they can trust one another       the faculty   is another smart and pop culturally hip film from williamson   although it does not equal up to his best film   the original   scream     and rodriguez   whose   from dusk till dawn   is still one of the more original genre films of the 90 s    williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions   respectively   that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no brainer    the plotline of   the faculty     involving aliens taking over other people s bodies   has been done quite a lot before   from   invasion of the body snatchers     to   the puppet masters     to   invaders from mars     so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh   and by setting the goings on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens   they were mostly successful    surely   the conventions of the story are still the same   and the climax was inevitable   but there were a few surprises along the way   including the question of who were the aliens   and who weren t    the epilogue was also a refreshing change of pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better    the performances in   the faculty   were a treat throughout   since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do    one exception were the teens   who   aside from elijah wood   are not very well known   but they all aquit themselves nicely   particularly wood   the seasoned pro     clea duvall   and jordanna brewster    as members of the faculty   robert patrick     t2   judgement day     was creepy as the gym coach   piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher   bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien   and salma hayek   as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold   was very funny in a small role    the standout   in my opinion   of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who   after turning into an alien   becomes the sex bombshell    if there was any problem i had with the faculty   it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence    since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the   queen   alien   many of the faculty members disappear    it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers   although the finale is still pretty impressive   and includes some showstopping creature effects   especially for a relatively low 15 million dollar budget    although not one of the best horror or science fiction films i have seen     the faculty   is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released    while the story is as old as the hills   it is also   in a way   timeless   because everyone   i think   has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right   as if they really weren t human    and by putting this idea in the setting of a small town high school   it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers    + note   the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading   as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters    in actuality   he only has a small role as one of stan s buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team    if i were one of the heads from dimension   i would change this advertising at once   since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving    
Neg, a movie laced with a good blend of action   comedy   and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet   but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way   creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product    eighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters   blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed   minus half of its original duo   the late john belushi   and nearly all of its original charm    dan aykroyd reprises his role   as well as his co writing credit   as elwood blues   the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self proclaimed   mission from god   along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago    as we begin   elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother s death in prison years ago    completely on his own   elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood   only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away    but elwood isn t completely without family    it seems he has a half brother of sorts   not a real brother mind you   just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo father curtis   cab calloway from the first film     who has also passed on    despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata   kathleen freeman   to do otherwise   elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band    working as a police commander   cabel chamberlain   joe morton     has an immediate disliking for elwood   who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mother s affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet    following elwood around is the lonely orphan buster   j    evan bonifant     who quickly learns to become a mini elwood    when bartender mighty mack mcteer   john goodman   joins the group   the blues brothers band is complete   and once again   the group travels the country   crashing cars   blowing things up   and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock    meanwhile   cab s personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next to next of kin    >from this point   the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between    those hoping for an interesting and/or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story    only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours    for those people   it may be worth it   for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting   but when the story does intrude upon the festivities   the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes   musicians turned stiff actors   and the pointless 10 year  old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing    appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin   james brown   eric clapton   and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film   but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors    blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really   really love this kind of music   you might kind of   sort of like this movie    many   many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny   and if you don t have a passion for very deep blues/rock   you ll be bored out of your skull    much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd s self serving vanity project   but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this   none of the excitement is passed on to the audience    and seeing three guys in three piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long    unfortunately   those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film    
Neg, at the outset of swordfish   john travolta s gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today    basically   he says   it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers    how ironic   as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture    swordfish is loud   violent and amoral    it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life    and how does travolta s gabriel plan to do this    by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out terrorize terrorists    swordfish is a very cynical movie    it relies on an audience s perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non human   faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration    the movie s plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down   you d actually see how ridiculous it all is    this is a live action road runner cartoon   moving so quickly that it s over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions    the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson   hugh jackman     recruited by gabriel to crack the government s computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti terrorist campaign    talk about whacked out patriotism    my objections to swordfish are many    the body count is high   but that is expected in a movie of this sort    it s becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers   police officers and government agents blown to bits    another example is the family dynamics between stanley   his 10 year old daughter and his ex wife    stanley   though having served time in prison for hacking   is shown as a loving and caring father   forbidden by his ex to see his little girl    audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband s adult films    thus when she is found murdered late in the movie   neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve    in fact   subconsciously   many in the audience are probably glad she was killed    then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel s henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley s daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel    children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich   in recent films    there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on screen victims as well    yea   it s only make believe   but that doesn t mean you have to tolerate it    travolta is cool   deadly charming and flamboyant as the near crazy gabriel    his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off    jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings    his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database    his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate    halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel s assistant   while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel    swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger than life character in gabriel    viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain    and maybe that is the movie s underlying flaw   there is no real hero to speak of   only those doing their upmost to survive    and that is not enough    this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water    
Neg, at times   you d think edtv would be an entertaining film    i mean   who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day    but this average joe   ed perkuny     matthew mcconaughay     is a sappy   lifeless creation that wanders around   trying to solve everyone s problems and settle his own    mcconaughay is awful   especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans    frankly   he had more charm in the devestating flop the newton boys    he overacts in every way   his overexaggerant body language   obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance   and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life   and drops to his knee and cries    the rest of the cast is very good   especially martin landau   as ed s step father     who plays a cute role as the close to death old guy that makes all the witty comments    jenna elfman is good     but a little overemotional     her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films   i   e    can t hardly wait   and krippendorf s tribe    woody harrelson   as ed s brother ray   does his usual egg headed role   with his comic wit as well   he wrote a book entitled     my brother pissed on me        elizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut   and dennis hopper   in a quick cameo as ed s biological father   is a nice choice   ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman show      ellen degeneres stood out as the executive who   after awhile   decides the show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec   rob reiner s opinion    i hate to compare this film to the truman show   but the fact is   i was ashamed to see this movie    it felt that i had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman and ed    edtv had no real wit or genius   it was typical hollywood    extracting the tv part of the movie   you have the simple plotline   man steals brother s girlfriend   girlfriend leaves town   man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on   slut breaks up with him   real girlfriend comes back   and voila   you have a romance    i got so restless during this movie   i almost walked out    the only reason it doesn t drop below a   c   grade is because of the fine supporting performances    ad2am   i almost lost my nose       and  i like it    i like breathing through it       jack nicholson   chinatown  
Neg, david schwimmer   from the television series   friends     stars as a sensitive   and slightly neurotic   single guy who gets more than he expected from the grieving mother   barbara hershey   of a classmate he can t remember    hello mrs   robinson !  though quite cute as a romantic comedy   the pallbearer is paced like a funeral march    the characters act   react   and interact at half speed   making for one * excruciatingly * long sit       and what s with the dreary lighting      co writer/director matt reeves brings some snap to the story s midsection   the film briefly comes to life when our hero attempts to resolve his feelings for * another * classmate   a very appealing gwyneth paltrow      by this time   though   most viewers will have either fled or fallen asleep    those tough souls who stay with it can marvel at the sleepy eyed schwimmer   a hound dog with a head cold   who can go for over an hour without ever changing his expression    
Pos, i was anxious to see this for a long time    a friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell   and he wanted to prove that she s as hot as he thinks he is    he proved it for me all right   but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that    scream treads on familar ground   horror movie with   as star neve campbell puts it     some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can t act who s always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door      it s very familar   your typical horror film    so why   you may ask after watching it   does it seem so new and original    because it treats itself as if it hasn t been done before   and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old   familar tired stuff    this raises another question   how does it do this    simple   the characters    they re not your typical stupid horror film victims who don t know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette    they are horror fans   they know how stuff happens in a horror movie   they know what to do and what not to do   and that makes it scary   and even funny at certain times    you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker   drew barrymore   is making popcorn   getting ready to watch a video   and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that   if she gets it wrong   will get her and her boyfriend killed    she knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions   she just can t answer his final question     what door am i at      and that gets her killed    that scene works because in a normal horror film   half the things that happen in that scene would never happen    the plot is typical horror stuff   sidney prescott   an impressive neve campbell     an attractive young high school student who s mother was killed a year ago tommorrow   is being stalked by a killer who s previously murdered one of her classmates   casey   naturally     and everybody in this small   california town is a suspect   including sidney s boyfriend   billy loomis    but as i said before   these people know how horror movies work   and that s what makes it so appealing    that and the references to horror movies   like when casey says     the first   nightmare on elm street   was scary   but the rest sucked      which is obviously director wes craven   who does a good job of poking fun of the genre that made him a legend   patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others   and when tatum   sidney s friend   mentions the director   wes carpenter   which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven   but also director john carpenter    the cast is well chosen   neve campbell pulls off a good heroine   and unlike most horror film heroines   she * can * act     drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film   and david arquette is impressive    also good   and funny   in his role is henry winkler     the fonz     as the school principal    i took half a point off for the unnecessary   albeit limited   appearance by friends  courteney cox as reporter   gail edwards   sidney s rival because she covered her mother s disappearance    i hate that show   i hate those actors    they re untalented   overexposed   and overpaid   imho   and i would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough   but i suppose he isn t    
Pos, if you thought baz luhrmann s radical take on  william shakespeare s romeo + juliet  was wild   wait until what you see what tony award winning stage director julie taymor    the lion king    the broadway musical    does to the bard s  titus andronicus  for her audacious  and very bloody  film debut    while luhrmann transplanted the star crossed lovers to 1990s florida   taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in rome  but places it in a surreal temporal limbo    the colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome   but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the 1990s   while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more  40s and  50s   and other garments are more gladiator like    as tamora   queen of goths   jessica lange   exacts revenge on roman general titus   anthony hopkins   for killing her eldest son   and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits   taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of the story s underlying themes    however   the time convergence approach only works at times   for often it s just distracting   as in one scene where tamora s suviving sons   matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyers   blow off steam playing video arcade games    taymor didn t have to resort to such avant garde time tricks   for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them    she is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist   the latter compliment encompassing all areas   makeup and costume choices as well as those in the editing and photography departments    she also has a sure way with actors   hopkins  titus is at once tragic and horrifying   and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora    the clear standout of the cast   however   is harry lennix as aaron   a moor who is tamora s secret lover and a schemer in his own right    lennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock villain    a great villain he indeed is   but to leave it at that isn t giving full justice to his powerful and multi dimensional work     titus  isn t a complete success   but it is never less than fascinating   and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice    
Neg, in double jeopardy   the stakes are high    think of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy   and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker    the finished product   although able to maintain the viewer s attention   is a predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script    `alex   i ll take homicide for $400          libby parsons   ashley judd   is a happily married mom leading a normal life    one night   her husband nick   bruce greenwood   takes her out for a romantic escape on a sailboat    libby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood and nick has strangely disappeared    she follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck   where she handles a fallen knife   like any stupid character   and is spotted by the coast guard   who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening    nick is presumed dead   and although she pleads her innocence   libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband    now   please don t think i m spoiling any vital plot details   because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans    if you haven t seen this preview   don t read any further    but seriously   the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas s   cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters    during the most vital scenes in the movie   i was anticipating every twist or `surprise  that eventually popped up on the screen    i imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals    most   unfortunately   will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production    one is tommy lee jones   who plays travis lehman   a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison    jones is always wonderful as an authority figure   and he s certainly familiar with this sort of role   as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals      judd   as a likable heroin with gusto   also has a chance to flex her acting abilities    while emotionally unconvincing   the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role   perking up the movie like an injection of anti depressant    the actors   and their relationship together   present the one two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely    and now   back to the plot    while behind bars   libby learns an interesting little bit of information   a person can t be convicted of the same crime twice    this law   called `double jeopardy    could be her motive for hunting down her husband        who may still be alive    yes   you heard right    the movie degenerates into a cross country chase   where everything you expect to happen        does    the final scenes   which could have redeemed the film   are poorly handled by director bruce beresford   whose previous work centers highly around drama   driving miss daisy   paradise road      ironically   it is those elements   like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son   that don t quite work here    at least double jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars    unfortunately   jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive   and the real depth of his character is only skin deep    but he and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material   and both have some memorable comic moments    judd   in particular   has a hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her `parole officer     hmmm        perhaps this would have made a good comedy    it is disappointing   because there are the makings of a competent action film here    it s nicely shot and choreographed in downtown vancouver   and will entertain those who aren t turned off by the woeful story line       tis a shame that double jeopardy is an adult thriller that wouldn t fool most children    
Pos, in roger michell s romantic comedy notting hill   william thacker   hugh grant   leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it s name to the film s title    one day   american movie superstar anna scott   julia roberts   walks in to purchase a book on turkey    quickly enamored of each other   the two embark upon an on again   off again love affair replete with romance   humor   and the occasional lump in the throat    the film opens with a non verbal cue to anna s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress s appearances in films and at premieres   coming out of limousines   walking the red carpets and such    without words   this sequence gives us a background to her character    following   however   is a set up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives    i don t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film   and which never resurfaces after the movie s beginning   but there it is    if there were ever a clear case for   less is more     this would be it    the film is told nearly first person from william s point of view   as he is in every scene    by nature of this arrangement   we get a very definite sense of what he is all about   and his nice guy personality wins us over easily    in fact   much of notting hill s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis    a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey soaked apricots from his refrigerator    or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image    william assures her he wouldn t say a word   then adds     well   i ll probably tell myself now and then   but i d never believe it      great stuff    the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible    we re constantly exposed to william s thoughts   feelings   actions and desires   but don t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him    there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest   but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we re not sure what she s been thinking all the times in between    this   combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two   makes this hugh grant s film hands down    he gets the great scenes   look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna     the great lines   and gives an overall wonderful performance    julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film   ala sandra bullock in a time to kill   along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character s unpredictable behavior    anna doesn t get a lot of our compassion    this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance   much of it supplied by grant himself   but with considerable help from the supporting cast    most notable is rhys ifans as spike   william s eccentric roommate   who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh    hugh bonneville   emma chambers   james dreyfus   and gina mckee bring up the guard as william s friends and family   particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister s birthday dinner   and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst    it s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation    roger michell s use of visuals doesn t sweep us off our feet   but does give us more than your typical movie of this type    for example   there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass    whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying   eight months later     michell presents us with more interesting cues   such as william s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him    another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air    we re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so   but in this case   the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird s eye view of the ground below    music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film s scenes   and some of this might have been better toned down   but in other areas it works to full effect    it s kind of a mixed bag   but still fares better than many of today s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video    at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate    notting hill s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all time greatest film pairings   but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it    for a couple of hours   you should expect to laugh more than cry   and that s not so bad   now is it    
Pos, larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the owner/publisher of the multi million dollar hustler publications company    the people vs   larry flynt is the story of larry flynt s fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine   hustler    based on a true story   the film is almost a documentary in that it s a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynt s life    woody harrelson gives an excellent performance    he conveys flynt s peculiarities and his character with depth and focus    by the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves   somewhat grudgingly   liking larry flynt    this is some feat given flynt s apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court    however   flynt has a number of things going for him   he s rich   he s funny   and most importantly   he says exactly what he means    larry flynt s wife   althea leasure is played by courtney love    larry meets althea at one of his clubs   and they fall in love   a very sexual and open love      both of them indulge in a world of too much sex   and eventually too much drugs    flynt had been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down   which was especially upsetting for him   by an assassin    althea had joined him in taking the drugs    following an operation flynt decides to stop taking drugs   althea does not have any such plans   nor the determination to follow them    as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail and sick    courtney love obviously has a great understanding for althea s situation   as she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect    it s extremely sad to watch althea literally wither away    edward norton plays flynt s lawyer   alan isaacman    again   this is a solid performance    the audience finds it easy to sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts up with flynt s courtroom antics    flynt is not only childish in the courtroom   but downright rude to the judges   and lands himself in a lot of trouble   and even in a mental institution   because of it    isaacman is very easy to like   and great at proving   in quite clever ways   his points to the court    milos forman has done a great job in directing the people vs   larry flynt    it is not really an exciting or thrilling film   but instead a highly interesting portrayal of a true story    due to larry s character it is also   at times   a very funny film    however   it is much more than that    it is about the fight for freedom of speech   anti censorship   and the right to be able choose for oneself what to see and buy    an excellent look at flynt   his life   and his story    keep a look out for the real larry flynt who makes a cameo as judge morrissey

Neg, not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie    earlier this year   nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year s least likeable   comedies   called hanging up   featuring a bunch of annoying women   ironically   lisa kudrow played one in that film as well   who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves    ick       real  sweet stuff    but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer   with a film entitled battlefield earth    i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film   even if it was on a   cheese   factor   as everybody   and i mean everybody else   pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time    yipes       another  beauty    so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co starring the ever versatile lisa kudrow    uhhhm   you guessed it       not  much    plot   in order to escape major financial difficulties   a local weatherman hooks up with his ball picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery    but as more and more people find out about their scheme   more and more people demand a part of their winnings   and more and more problems arise    critique   simply stated   i didn t laugh once during this entire picture    for a comedy   it offered me a few smiles   a bunch of nincompoops as characters   a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow   in what can only described as a   sluttier   version of her character of phoebe on tv s   friends      this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be   but it was pretty close    thankfully   the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits   dancing as the weatherman were left in the film s trailer   and not in this final cut    and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far   beautiful   this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic   idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast    foremost was travolta s character   who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie    and for me   the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong    he didn t fit the part    i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role    a cool   calculating roughneck with a certain hip   suave   je ne sais quoi      in this film   he looks like he s trying to be funny   trying to be bad   trying to be good    we re not supposed to be able to notice that   and when we do   at least in my case   i consider it a wrong choice in casting    add that to lisa kudrow   boring us with yet another one of her patented   dumb blonde   routines   but this time   dressed in sexier outfits    michael rapaport   stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn t quite up at the same speed level as everyone else    and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells   and you ve got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize    the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half interesting and never really bored me    i also liked michael moore s perverted cousin character   and i loved   and i say it again   loved the character that bill pullman played    give this dude his own movie !  he played a lazy cop   a man who tries everything not to do any real work    he fakes injuries to get off duty   tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won t have to fill out any forms       now  there s a base of humor    sadly   the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film    and there s not much else i can say about this movie   folks    on the whole   it was lame   included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines   and very little of interest for any target audience    but get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and i m there !  
Pos, note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    among my fanatical ticker tape worshipping friends   there s one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky s darkly original pi   the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which   through analysis   will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour       an example of the mentality involved   if the stock price goes up like this   and then down like that   and then sharply up this way   it then will go * this * way      while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market   knowledge check   prices up    good   prices down    bad   most of the time   at least   and hence really couldn t comment with any authority   it s always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system   and besides   if it were that simple   no doubt somebody would ve already figured it all out      the difference in this case is that while my colleague   an otherwise assuredly realistic individual   truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster   pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character s psychosis    it s also vastly more convincing with its argument       mathematics is the language of the universe     insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen   sean gullette   in a cool   mantra like voice over which repeats throughout the picture    since nature can be expressed in numbers   and there are patterns everywhere in nature   he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything    the ups and downs of the stock market   how many games the yankees will win this year   the flavour of jam i m going to put on my toast tomorrow morning    obsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe   max lives in paranoid   self imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment   single mindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system    sullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines   the elusive pursuit of a mysterious 216 digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness    the story   then   is basically an eccentricity   but it s a clever   astute eccentricity   perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism   in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one s individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers   max s all consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering   unsettling mood    it helps matters that he s not a particularly likable protagonist    all attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max   a spindly   neurotic looking individual who hasn t the time to indulge in pleasantries    for a film which puts its lead character front and center   mr   gullette appears in virtually every scene     pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics   because of our ambivalence with max   we re not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we re following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination    it s more disturbing journey than quest    still   we do care about max s fate    teetering on the edge of dementia   he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain   both fronted by deliciously perky   resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions    as we know   in films where paranoia is a dominant element   see the truman show s laura linney character     or for that matter   in real life   it s always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary    pi   a film that addresses patterns   itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle    headache scene   important revelation or bit of plot development   pill popping montage   hallucinatory nightmare   with decidedly cronenberg esque undertones    few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and body themed horror     nosebleeding reality    the repetitiveness   far from being tedious   is effectively maddening   more than anything   the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from max s claustrophobic perspective    in this regard   it wildly succeeds due to mr   aronofsky s striking direction    it s a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist s warped perspective of his surrounding   and high contrast black and white cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme close ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings       in some scenes   the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr   gullette make his character curiously resemble a latter day max schreck   from nosferatu      using savage   jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation   the picture is often dizzying to behold   and max s effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so called snorri cam   which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts    pi s raw   aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynch s early work   in particular   eraserhead      the film s sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell   and gradually increases in intensity    still   amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood   pi does occasionally display a sense of humour    at one point   marcy dawson   pamela hart   great fun   entices max with the offer of an invaluable treasure   a one of a kind        computer chip       isn t it beautiful     she coos    a showcase for mr   aronofsky s technical virtuosity   made for $60 000   it s since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 sundance film festival     pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which   ironically   is perhaps the most purely visceral film of the year    
Neg, of course i knew this going in    why is it that whenever a tv star makes a movie it s always a romantic comedy   and then they say on entertainment tonight or something   that they were   attracted to the characters    they were really original      original   ! let me give you a run through of picture perfect   character a   kate   jennifer aniston   from tv s friends     a smart   beautiful   professional woman wants two things she can t have   a new job title and the love of her co worker kevin bacon    her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar   and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls    what does she do    she invents a fiance !  then when everyone wants to meet him   she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner   and pick a fight with her at the end   thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job   since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor   defenceless female    he   of course   goes along with it    gee   i wonder if they get together in the end    i ve seen more original stuff on the wb    and better stuff too    picture perfect also makes the mistake of being  wayyyyy  too long at 100 minutes   and expecting us to like aniston s character   who comes off as a cold   spoiled bitch    
Pos, reflecting on   bedazzled     a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser   one sinful thought remains in my mind    if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley   who portrays the fiery demon     then use that pitchfork and point me the way    with her pouty lips   irresistible british accent   and wild display of haute couture   hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation    it s practically impossible to turn this beelzu babe down    her next target is elliot   brendan fraser     a tech support geek who is clumsy   awkward   and just too eager to please    to aptly picture him   you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring   steve the copy guy   who effortlessly irritated his co workers with his unpolished social skills    eugene   thus   is loathed and feared by his co workers   who do their best to stay out of his way    yet   beyond his annoying mannerisms   he s a lovable oaf    he wishes that he could get closer to allison   frances o connor     a co worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him    however   the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowball s chance in hell       dear god     he prays       i would give anything to have that girl in my life      guess who then shows up    she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse       seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul      there s even an escape clause    if elliot s wish doesn t go exactly the way he likes   he need only  beep  her   one guess as to what the three digit number is   and he gets to start over    the remainder of the film consists of elliot s various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth   power   fame and allison s love    but when he makes sweeping statements such as   i want to be very   very powerful and very   very rich and married to allison     he ll soon learn that the devil is in the details    for example     and we ve seen this several times in the trailers     he is granted his wish   but finds out that he s a columbian drug lord and that allison   while married to him   has her eyes on someone else    apparently   the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul    his other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short circuits his new life    soon   elliot wishes that he had never made that deal    given the mischievous nature of the devil     bedazzled   has many amusing moments    a lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance    he ably assumes various personas    his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world    allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her    hurley also heightens the humor quotient   especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one    it s clear that she s having a good time with it all    yet   while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes   they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story    but that would be playing with fire    what they ve got works   so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is

Pos, the   italian hitchcock   and acknowledged master of the giallo murder mystery dario argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena    this time the twist comes in the form of jennifer corvino   jennifer connelly     a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects    sent to a girls boarding school in switzerland   she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the school s population terrified    a chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist   donald pleasance   leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift    phenomena is an imaginative   original thriller    writer/director argento creates several sequences of surreal   haunting beauty here   including a masterfully shot sleepwalking episode and a striking scene when a swarm of flying insects descends on the school at jennifer s beckoning    the plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killer s identity is genuinely shocking and surprising    the director took a big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden   ex rolling stone bill wyman   and argento s favourite gothic/electronic outfit goblin    but it gels surprisingly well    the film s opening music reccurs several times   an eerie and evocative score that perfectly sets the overall tone    argento fans beware   the film was released outside europe in a terribly butchered form re titled as creepers    this deleted nearly half an hour of footage   mainly of key dialogue scenes    
Pos, when i first heard of contact   the hype was building it up as a sci fi blockbuster    now   with that in mind   coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster s involvement in the project   i thought   what in the world is foster doing in a sci fi blockbuster            as it turned out   my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy turvy    robert zemeckis   back from the euphoria created by his last film   forrest gump   once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit    don t get me wrong   contact is sci fi   but with a definite difference    based on the late carl sagan novel of the same name   the story delves itself in questions on science and god   fact and faith    allie   foster   is a radio astronomer    she spends her time listening to the stars   via ultra huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system    her passion for `long distance communication  is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham radio system   a hobbyist radio communication device   which her late father bought for her    a scene which particularly strengthens the audiences  view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late mother through the ham radio system in which her father replied   not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that   now      allie s research is based on the seti project   search for extra terrestrial intelligence     in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation    her work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government   which considers it a waste of taxpayer s money and politically unviable   her supervisor   tom skerritt   pulls the plug on seti    undaunted   allie managed to gather a loyal group of `believers  and eventually found funding from a large private corporation    the following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day   she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound wave    the news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers   cultist   the media and of course   the government    the situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission    as the world join forces to build this transport   allie is desperate to be the one to go    she enrols herself among a few hopefuls   to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation    her eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president s spiritual advisor   mcconaughey     allie   being an atheist   a result of her belief in fact and science   refuses to budge upon questioning    at this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president s spiritual advisor    a strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey    from the very first meeting scene   it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects   foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith   hope and the power of the unseen    the meeting of their worlds   added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless    many people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous   but by actually immersing yourself in it   gives you an entirely different perspective   one which is free from bias and pre conceptions    zemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film    contact works by not delving in controversy but rather   touches the thinking audience   urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith   whether one can actually find compromise within    i consider contact as one of the must sees for this year    
Neg, you know something   christmas is not about presents    it s about over hyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie ins    at least that would seem to be the message of   the grinch     which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores    hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season    you know the plot   there s this evil furry green guy called the grinch   jim carrey   who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville    down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation   but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas    the movie is   of course   a live action version of the beloved children s book   which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones    it s rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty year old half hour cartoon   but that s the case when jones  version is compared to ron howard s    the tv grinch hit all the right notes   boris karloff s soft   deep narration   thurl ravenscroft singing   mr   grinch     max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head   and the grinch s wide   toothless grin    by contrast   the movie hits one sour note after another    first   there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105 minute movie    young wide eyed cindy lou who   taylor momsen   is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents   bill irwin and molly shannon   during the holiday season    she begins to sympathize with the grinch   who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic    cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class   martha may whovier   played as an adult by christine baranski      are we expected to like the grinch   hate the whos   and want him to steal christmas    the grinch isn t even the villain here   that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville   jeffrey tambor   who was the grinch s rival for martha s affection    not only are the characters needlessly complex   but the once simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought    the casting choices aren t any better than the screenwriting decisions    jim carrey seems woefully miscast    while his face is so supple that the rubber make up seems superfluous   carrey brings nothing else to the role    his accent keeps changing   i assume he was shooting for karloff   but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon   sean connery   and cartman from   south park      not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinch s home   carrey falls back on his stand up comedy and clowns around ace ventura style    needless to say   his wise cracking antics don t quite fit the character of the grinch   who is an embittered loner filled with hate    little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile    she would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story   finding   santa   in her living room stealing the tree      however   the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch   and momsen is not up to the challenge    bottom line   when you re stealing christmas   movies     leave this one behind    
Neg,    practical magic     is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap trap like this one    the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens   two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches   spanning back 200 years    at the start   their parents die when they are still children   and they go to live with their two zany aunts   stockard channing and dianne wiest      switch to the present day   gillian   who is the stronger   more rebellious sibling   leaves home   and meets up with a dark   abusive guy   goran visjnic     while sally stays in their hometown   meets and falls in love with a sweet   caring man   has two children   and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed   come to think of it   she s not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes      when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic   they accidentally murder him   and in desperation   bury the body in the backyard of their aunts  house    add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism   not to mention a spattering of   light hearted whimsy     and you have a pretty good idea how messy   practical magic   is    after seeing the film   i reflected that there was not even one scene   or element   that i liked or enjoyed    it is a comedy   to be sure   but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat   and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching    it is not charming or entertaining in any way    and then to top it off   we ve got this dark   but bird brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian s body    whatever    the characters are handled terribly   and actually   most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character    there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film   and in every scene involving them   they are always standing side by side    no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people    the same goes for aidan quinn   as a handsome police investigator   who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock   even though he comes into it at around the 70 minute mark   and once again   there is no attempt to develop their relationship   or his character   in any way    in fact   every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along   rather than getting to know the people saying the lines    i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits   when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman   who managed to destroy the   batman   series with   batman forever   and   batman and robin         practical magic   is directed by griffin dunne   primarily an actor   who last year made the contrived   clumsy romance     addicted to love     with meg ryan and matthew broderick    i disliked that movie quite a bit   but since   practical magic   is even worse   that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is    i d tell him to quit while he s ahead   but in these last two years   he s ultimately already buried himself    
Pos,  pleasantville    1998   taps into hollywood s lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed     www   pleasantville   com   april 2   1999   friday    cast   tobey maguire   reese witherspoon   william h   macy   joan allen   j   t    walsh   jeff daniels  mpaa rating   pg 13 for sexual content and thematic elements  genre   drama  in my opinion    in short   it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film   one can easily be misled as to what the real message is    review   in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population   there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life   such as rain   fire   or emotions    the town of pleasantville has one adjective   pleasant    there is no sadness   no fear   no danger   no discomfort   no love   and no hate    put simply   it s a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for    j one big note however is that it is only a 50 s sitcom that airs in reruns on an   oldies   tv station   or is it    i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed    i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office    but it wasn t until months later   when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy   dollar theaters   after not having seen it for so long   that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced    it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some   healthy   immorality is not a world at all    instead   the actual message   which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of   is that a world without immorality doesn t give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself   because everything is automatically right    there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made   no space for growth   and never anything new to learn   and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story    now i m not saying that s necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted   but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be    besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews   this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch    the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable    after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white   it s hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more    a truly intelligent addition to it all   however   is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork    that said   the plot goes as such    david and jennifer are two very 90 s high school twins with the typical   relationship   outline of don t mess with my life and i won t mess with yours    they demonstrate the well known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today    david is the shyer   subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv   while jennifer is the wild   licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation    but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters   they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home    nevertheless   jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life   and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home   he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed    and   as said earlier   not to flip the town around into some corrupt society   but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them    not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town   but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place    people got hurt    they cried    they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves   and that s when their physical world turned colors as well    this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie   but to me the message is finally clear    i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past   and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run   we ll never know what we could have done better    until the next great movie i see   i remain sincerely   danielle flynn   imr  
Pos, carry on matron is the last great carry on film in my opinion    made in 1972   it still features most of the regulars of this genre    sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit   kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting   head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac   hattie jacques re takes her role as matron   and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr   goode    the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs   with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard    this time   williams is after matron   jacques   when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr   goode    the doctor   hawtrey   is sworn to secrecy       i assure you   that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other !    bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself    there are great cameos from joan sims   an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene   and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he s at work   at the railway station      sid james  gang including cyril his son   kenneth cope   try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home    he has to share a room with nurse ball   barbara windsor   and she soon sees through him !  the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital s pills with panic ensuing    there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron   however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous  matron s     williams is   as usual   on top form   but sid james isn t given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all    the same does not go for charles hawtrey   for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time   he seems to steal every scene he is in    by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor s talent to full effect   the film seems to flounder   but it certainly makes up for it with it s good storyline and it s other appealing characters    this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored !  
Neg, i ve always been a kevin kline fan   silverado   fish called wanda   pirates of penzance   and even his hamlet on pbs  great performances    the minute i saw the trailer for this film   i resolved to see it    besides the fact that kline starred   it looked like a hilarious film    i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent   however   as i also thought     wow   if there s this much funny stuff in the trailer   there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film         oops   i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo   my name for our local multi multi plex      the film began          the film concerns an english/drama teacher at a suburban high school   named howard brackett    he loves poetry and great literary works   but his class is more interested in his famous former student   played by matt dillon       i d put in his name   but my wife won t let me take notes during a movie and i ve forgotten it      they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him    brackett has been engaged to another teacher   played by joan cusack   for three years   and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her    the wedding   however   becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual    kline spends most of the first two thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn t    the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference    his closest friends don t help matters   bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party    there are some genuinely hilarous moments   one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity    kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck   who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out   while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations    the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding    kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows        if you want to be surprised   don t read   i am going to reveal the ending           instead of saying   i do   in front of his parents and most of the town   and even some cameras   he says   i m gay      this is where the movie   in my opinion falls apart    most of the humor in the film had come from kline s insistence that he was straight   while at the same time   loving poetry and being a senstivie guy   dressing well   and occaisionally acting prissy    it reminded me of the   effeminate heterosexual   sketch from saturday night live    it was funny   it was sustainably funny   and kline s performance made it doubly so    however   after the wedding   the film drags on    they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion   but it then gets into the serious side of what he s done    he reconciles with his parents and his friends   some of which had turned on him    there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time   the scene with his mother and her friends   which was hilarious   seemed pointless   and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless    finally   even though i am not catholic   i found the scene with the priest to be condescending    the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship   proclaiming to brackett in the third person     he s gay      it got a chuckle from the audience   but i was distracted by it   and began to tire of the film    by the time the wedding had come and gone   i found myself hoping it would be over soon       much like this review you are saying    overall   if i have to quantify it   i say   rising action gets * * * * and climax and falling action gets    see it in economy time    
Neg, it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it s stars   roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70    mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood   having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films    fright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles    this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was    william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us       at least in the movies anyway      it has been several years since charlie brewster   ragsdale   and b movie actor turned late night horror film host   peter vincent   mcdowall   came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlie s next door neighbor    charlie and peter won that battle   but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family    apparently charlie s former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling    so she decides to exact a little bit of revenge    this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again    one of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie s stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood    fright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort    while they are stylish   the vamps in this film just don t have the personality of the undead in the first film    with the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes    one bright spot   speaking from a strictly sexist point of view   is traci lin   who plays charlie s very skeptical girlfriend    it s really a shame that her career hasn t been better since she made this film    ragsdale does a fair job in this film   but doesn t give nearly the performance that he did in the original    roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given   which unfortunately isn t much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie    i guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way    the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner   part 2 had more of the feel of a music video    never a good thing for a horror film    another minus for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare    for that matter   they were almost nonexistent    if i was going to watch a horror film   this would be far from my first choice    the first fright night   on the other hand   would be right up near the top of my list    if i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film i d probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes    either way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation    
Pos, it s a curious thing   i ve found that when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie   he s much better and so is the movie    even though   in the sixth sense he is the   name     he doesn t have the pivotal role    that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear   cute pun   seer   a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts    if osment was cute or precious   the director going for the maudlin   this would be nothing more than a movie of the week   thankfully   osment is not only better than that   but in some instances   blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance    we get to see his fears   vulnerabilities   strengths and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies i ve seen this year    the whole cast matches him in quality   with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches the subject matter    one thing about this movie   its target    this isn t a sfxfest like the haunting or a gorefest   this is more what i d call a supernatural drama   more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup    one caveat   there s a lovely twist in the movie   something like the usual suspects   where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen    i was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto   before any hype or critical reviews were out   so i went in with no biases    if anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it   don t let them    let the director explain on his own pace and you ll enjoy the movie vastly more    
Neg, michael robbins  hardball is quite the cinematic achievement    in about two hours   we get a glancing examination of ghetto life   a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy   speeches about never giving up   a cache of cute kids   including a fat one with asthma     a hard luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic   big game     where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined    all that s needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich   s    i can t wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd    obviously   hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball    it stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler   who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam    out of solutions   he begs his successful corporate friend   the always welcome mike mcglone   to lend him $5   000    instead   mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend    reeves   who wants to keep his fingers   accepts the offer   but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely    the drowsy voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs    and maybe   just maybe   they ll play in the big championship game    one of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins   summer catch     adapted from daniel coyle s non fiction book   is that there aren t any    the movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie    that wouldn t be so bad   if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them    most of the kids  time is spent yelling at each other   talking in slang and acting surprised    there s little that s naturally amusing about them   as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling    the worst of the lot is a tough talking younger player   dewayne warren   whose sole purpose   as the movie unfolds   is being an emotional pawn   a tactic so utterly despicable i can t find the right words to express myself    the adults also don t fare well    reeves is impressively uninspiring as the down on his luck loser    the character is poorly written   but reeves gives another charisma free performance    every time he speaks   he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up    kids are supposed to rally around this guy    diane lane   who co stars as reeves  obligatory love interest   remains a glowing screen presence   see my dog skip for better proof      it s too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like     these kids trust you   and they don t trust anyone !    then there s d   b    sweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves  scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters you ve seen before and hope never to see again    i wanted hardball to be good    robbins  varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved    i haven t seen robbins  goofy ready to rumble in its entirety   but i am intrigued that   macho man   randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions    robbins obviously needs to go back to his forte    making sports movies for guys and not cutesy   cuddly pap such as hardball   which also manages to annoy and insult the audience    here s hoping that happens in the immediate future    
Pos, most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy    rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category   but manages to be slightly unique    the rocky formula of   rocky loses fight/rocky trains/rocky wins fight   is carried out to the letter    also the  tradition  of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well    this movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky   sylvester stallone   has become        even showing a brief appearance on sesame street ! !  then it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips   hulk hogan      a mysterious bad ass known as clubber lang   mr   t   trash talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he   pities the fool   for not coming out and fighting him outright    rocky s trainer   burgess meredith   tells rocky not to fight   but the italian stallion doesn t listen    naturally   he gets his ass kicked    somewhere along the line after this several things happen    rocky s longtime trainer dies   causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed    rocky s wife complains to her husband that he should fight    the final fight ensues between clubber and rocky    guess who wins    the winner s name rhymes with  smocky     the movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber lang s over the top performance    the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film    which is good if you like fighting scenes    the last match is quite decent actually    if you liked the previous films   rent this one    it s well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series    but if you can t stand rocky shouting   adrianne ! ! !    one more time   see something else    
Pos, note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    milos forman s first film since the ill fated valmont   columbia s the people vs    larry flynt   is a vastly entertaining   if not particularly enlightening   biopic of hustler publisher and self made millionaire larry flynt   who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s    the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order   we open with young and dirt poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy   peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky    cut to forward in time   where the two flynt brothers   now young men   are running the struggling hustler go go clubs in cincinnati    the strip clubs are in a dire financial state   and in a last ditch effort to salvage the operations   flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter    this evolved into the adult periodical  hustler  magazine   creating larry flynt a vast financial empire   and the rest is history    what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material   and who railed and preached against him   flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt   and his driven   single minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression   regardless of personal cost    the people vs    larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt s true love   althea leasure   whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries   and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations    considering the serious nature of the film s theme   the importance of the united states  first amendment   the people vs    larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light hearted and humourous    much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt s outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances   some of his chosen apparel is hilarious   and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points   such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity    the film s focus is on the flynt s many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech   but the heart of the people vs    larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea    larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff   harsh   and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues   but with althea   we see his loving   affectionate side    there s a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking    ultimately   the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors   but from the strength of flynt and althea s love for each other    woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt    harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience   and a very compelling protagonist for the film    courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn   completely raw and impulsive    it s a very solid performance   brash and naturalistic   and love is extremely compelling   it s difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen   and her chemistry with harrelson is dead on    edward norton   as flynt s straight   level headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co stars in the people vs    larry flynt   much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes   but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film    one can sense the frustration that norton s character feels when harrelson s free talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind   and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton s isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges    milos forman keeps the film moving   although it runs over two hours   it never drags   and his direction of the film is very effective   eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic    there s also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot   which is both clever and extremely entertaining    two minor quibbles with the film   it certainly seems like the people vs    larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme   with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech    consequently   the first thirty minutes of the film   introducing and setting up the characters   seem unduly rushed   perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting   but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion    it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters   the film clearly shows what flynt   althea   isaacman   and rev   jerry faldwell did   and on a superficial level some of their motivations   but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level    for example   why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton   president carter s sister   to be born again is a mystery to me    then again   perhaps it was to him as well    these two points don t detract greatly from the film    the people vs    larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio released films of 1996   and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression   and as a touching love story

Pos, you ve got mail works alot better than it deserves to    in order to make the film a success   all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars   have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits    no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it s body   it s basically a complete re shoot of the shop around the corner   only adding a few modern twists      essentially   it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking    it s overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy   not to mention very manipulative    but oh   how enjoyable that manipulation is    but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does   because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming   sleepless in seattle    it couldn t have been the directing   because both films were helmed by the same woman    i haven t quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you ve got mail   but then again   is that really important    if you like something so much   why even question it    again   the storyline is as cliched as they come    tom hanks plays joe fox   the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley   the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family run children s book shop called   in a nice homage   the shop around the corner    fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business    little do they know   they are already in love with each other over the internet   only neither party knows the other person s true identity    the rest of the story isn t important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen    sure   there are some mildly interesting subplots   but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship    all of this   of course   leads up to the predictable climax    but as foreseeable as the ending is   it s so damn cute and well done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does    when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love   i was filled with such   for lack of a better word   happiness that for the first time all year   i actually left the theater smiling    
Neg, your first clue that something isn t gonna be quite right with the movie you re about to see   it s heavily christmas themed and its release date is   oh   say   at the end of february    your second clue that something isn t gonna be quite right with the movie you re about to see   charlize theron   one of the movie s dubious stars   makes an appearance on the daily show in which   when asked if her new movie s any good   she replies with the equivalent of a verbal sigh        assuring us that   yeah   it sure is a movie   all right !  and there s some scenes like those you d expect to find in a movie   and there s some action        and there s other        stuff        too    how to immediately grab my attention   open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits    then show a caption reading   six days earlier          ya know   i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas        how to immediately lose my attention   follow your opening scene with a terminally dull nice guys who don t deserve to be in prison scene    write a line for the one of prisoners like   i just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad      then   have ben affleck actually say that line   on film   and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor    for good measure   throw in a poorly motivated prison riot and have affleck s best buddy stabbed        aw        and just two days before his release   too    already the cliches are piled on thick   and when it rains   it pours    how to take my attention   dash it violently against the rocks   and make it so that i m contemplating my strategy for calling   shotgun   about an hour before i know the credits will roll   deny your characters the ability to think    have ben affleck   for some reason i ll never understand   pretend he s his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend   played by charlize theron    have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist    the villains  big idea    kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino   force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are   then dress up in santa suits   create some   diversions   and rob the place    on paper   it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy   but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he s looking at the makings for some sort of clever action crime thriller    it s not like the man isn t capable        far from it    he s the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may    he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i ve ever seen in last year s ronin    but he s certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers        put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr   moreau    step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible   cast ben affleck in the role of the world s most generic hero    he gets no good one liners   he doesn t get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways   and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie    his name is rudy   short for rudolph   in all likelihood    see   it s called reindeer games    get it    get it    shut up      in the past   affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor   and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man    step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible   gary sinise s villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with    he s dirty and potty mouthed   he s got long   scruffy hair and a goatee   and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them    he s also extremely inept at what he does    he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises   and he trusts affleck s character to pull through even after   time and time and time again   he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him    but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role   sinise seems to think he s playing some sort of tough   smart   and smooth criminal mastermind   rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script    [on a side note   gary sinise wins this week s   title !    award   as he s the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings    last week s winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards   ]  how to take your bad idea and make things worse   include two or three plot twists that   instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent   make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely    this is a bad movie    and what s worse is that   except for a few moments near the not so stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous   reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad    if they d done that much   at least i would have been entertained    
Neg, 8mm is not going to enlighten your day    it s a dark   grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence    not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess   you ll require a lot of patience as well    nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late    he wore a bizarre get up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes   and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality    cage plays private investigator tom welles   praised for his secrecy and reliability    at home   welles is a family man   with a wife   catherine keener   and a small daughter to take care of    his new assignment is a bizarre one   the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband s safe    the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man   until the girl is brutally murdered    or so it seems    welles   of course   begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth    and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case   the more he gets in over his head    he hires an adult book store clerk named max california   joaquin phoenix   to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography    max knows what welles is getting himself into   and explains   `you dance with the devil   the devil don t change    the devil changes you      these turn out to be very wise words    8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution    the set up is slick and well played   as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her    this is where everything goes awry    although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world    he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula    everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless   repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects    although it had enormous potential   the third act of 8mm is a total bust   leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control    cage is the film s sole flame of energy    his performance is actually believable   but soon the director s demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation    still   you ve got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did   for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand    welles  trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker   played convincingly by peter stormare   who is notorious for the hardest hitting snuff films in the industry    this is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer like phase   in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film    he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing   chris bauer     and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery   a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie    written by andrew kevin walker   8mm dissipates into a poor man s seven   with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece    furthermore   what has become of joel schumacher    the director has recently experienced a major drought   slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop   batman and robin   anyone        this putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career   so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side    
Neg, absolute power   the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood   attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff    it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper    one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood    not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived   but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence    continually underestimating the audience   the film gives us information we already know or dont even need    details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying   like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night vision goggles in their car        oddly enough   the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities    a masterful jewel thief   played by clint eastwood   witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire   played by e   g    marshall      while robbing one of marshalls mansions   he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault    there   through a two way mirror   he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay    their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman    in self defense   the woman grabs a letter opener and stabs the man in the elbow    she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men    the man    he is the president of the united states of america    where does the film go wrong    it cannot be the acting    clint eastwood   ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type cast   but decent performances    the cinematography is sufficient   wild and erratic during action sequences   dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes   and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue    even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre    the fault clearly lies in the screenplay   and the screenplay alone    while setting up a story about misuse of power   about the true possessors of that power   and about intrigue and double crossing   it does not resolve it    not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax    rather   the tense situations are left dangling at the end   giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness    an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene   in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood   the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant    police officers are everywhere   incognito of course    at the same time   not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives    all three parties are unaware of each others presence    this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood   who might suspect this is a trap   will get himself out of this difficult position    he will probably have a brilliant plan   involving ingenious preparations    however   when he arrives at the trap   both hit men miss   how convenient   and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away    the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes    ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap    the scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds        parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter    the daughter blames her father for never being there for her   because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere    of course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family    again   it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot    however   trying is simply not enough !  the second story line should be subtle   original and preferably unpredictable        everything this film is not    how could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced    how could eastwood   who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven   ever believe in a project like this one    i am sad to say that my respect for the actor/director/producer has diminished substantially due to this film    director quentin tarantino once said     i can make a good movie out of any bad script      director clint eastwood obviously cannot    
Pos, apparently   director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film   american history x   i don t know the details of the fight   but it seems that he is not happy with the final product   and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether    i ve heard about this kind of thing happening before   and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce    as it is   i found american history x to be an extremely good film   not just because of tony kaye s focused look at the touchy subject of racism   but because of a powerful   charismatic performance from edward norton    it s hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton s fantastic role in primal fear   but   here he is now   starring in his own film and making himself a star    norton is one of those performers who becomes his character   and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year    he plays a young man named derek vinyard   a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother   danny   edward furlong     mother   beverly d angelo     and sister   davin   jennifer lien      the film opens with a flashback   in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car    we find out that this lands him in prison   and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny    in the present time of the film   danny is in high school   and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother    much of the film is told in flashback   and we see the path that leads to derek s adoption of white supremacy    when derek is released   having served three years in prison   he finds that his brother is now a full blown skinhead   derek   however   has given up the violence   and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things    what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid   thoughtless people    they are intelligent and articulate   and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms    it s hard to make a controversial movie and not preach   but kaye has found the right note for his material    because american history x is a mainstream film   there has to be a redemption phase for our main character    some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic    i partially disagree with this   because   although i do not advocate racism in any way   it s interesting the way kaye presents derek    he is a loud   obnoxious man   but he s also very smart    the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable    his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men    it s clear that he s passionate about his beliefs   and that he s not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up    of course   it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part    it s astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest    in addition to getting the look just right   he s perfect for this role    derek requires intelligence   depth   and a whole lot of shouting   and norton does it all with ease    even when he s at his meanest   derek has a likable quality to him   and that s a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead    what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny s school   avery brooks   becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny    the other performances are all terrific   with standouts from furlong   d angelo   and lien    visually   the film is very powerful    kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices   and most of them work nicely    lots of slow motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere    but   like a lot of movies lately   american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes    although the climactic scene is very moving   the picture ends with a pretentious   preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed    for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point   it felt like a slap in the face to be hand fed a theme in such a simplistic way    it makes me wonder what   exactly   tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film    perhaps this last scene was the problem    it s hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good    in a time when so many movies are timid and weak   american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way    
Pos, as the film opens up   expectant unwed mother sally   played by drew barrymore   encounters her baby s father in a fast food drive through window    after he gets his milkshake   he drives off   only to be pursued by a military helicopter    from this moment forward   you know that this isn t going to be your run of the mill romantic comedy    home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian   played by luke wilson     a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally       more  than he would care to admit   hint   it has something to do with the father of sally s unborn child      after taking a personal   and professional   interest in her   he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works   and the fun goes on from there    this movie is a lot of fun    it is comedic on two levels   as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy    the romantic moments are sweet   yet not sappy    one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes    however   the dark comedic moments are more memorable    this is also a tale of revenge   and a funny one at that    the father of sally s unborn child also happened to be a married man   whose wife is played by catherine o hara    she does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair   and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work       my apologies if this sounds cryptic   but there is too much of the plot to give away      rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus   dorian s overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy   dorian s trainer at the fast food restaurant    the dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones   even with the romantic nature of the plot    if there are any complaints   it is over drew barrymore s performance    while she does light up the screen   there are moments when she doesn t seem all that convincing    the movie was filmed in texas   and most of the characters have southern texan accents    drew barrymore s accent tends to come and go   luke wilson doesn t seem to have this problem      as well   she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant    still   this movie is one that will please many viewers    with plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments   this is sure to entertain

Pos, defending your life is an imaginative vision of the afterlife from the twisted mind of writer director albert brooks   who also stars in the comedy    after dying in a car crash   on his birthday of all days   brooks wakes up in judgement city   a satirical rendition of purgatory where higher beings evaluate the lives of newly deceased earthlings    brooks has five days to convince two judges that he s worthy of passing on to higher plains of existence    enter rip torn as the slick lawyer who defends brooks in court against prosecutor lee grant    during his   trial     brooks must view episodes of his life on a movie screen   and these scenes are both hysterically funny and painfully poignant    it s impossible to resist chuckling   and cringing   at brooks as he and torn try to explain away his cowardly behavior on earth    torn   in particular   is in vintage comic form   and he walks away with the picture    the movie also features meryl streep   appealing as the love interest   and shirley maclaine   who pops up in a hilarious cameo    while the film is uneven   many of its gags are price less    take   for example   the food in judgement city   it s always the most delicious you ve ever tasted        and it s also calorie free  so chow down !  
Neg, disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life   richard   leonardo dicaprio   sets off for thailand    there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy   robert carlyle   who gives him a map to a beach   a secret utopia   then commits suicide    richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel     tienne   guillaume canet   and fran   oise   virginie ledoyen      once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach   there richard falls for fran   oise    this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element   which is solely a creation of hollywood   seems to hold to the original novel    the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking    i don t think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning    but that is were many things go wrong   darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography    though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking    the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts    this is where the movie has some great potential   then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better   yes folks i said better    now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good   nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise    this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un watchable    there is even a  video game  style sequence that borders on the disgusting   it doesn t make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion   and i am hoping many other peoples      i am hoping that in my little rant i ve made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing   so if you go see it and you don t like it because of this don t blame me    the character development was not up to par either   i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child    although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard   leo s character   comes off as a wannabe philosopher    the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason   granted some people are like this   myself included   but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does    the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough    richard is obviously obsessed by fran   oise at the early stages of the story   yet there is actually very little development along this story line    this i am sure contributes to the movie s lack of core plot and being unfocused    now   i shall move onto something a little better about the movie   for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it      the cast and acting was passable at the very least   and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard    mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better    which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much       i think this is a topic all on its own so i won t get into it      but i like the fact that there was an international cast used   had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible    the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable    not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense    when all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable    i would not recommend this movie to anyone   the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story    as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt    if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings    
Pos, eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career    known for his notorious late 80 s slump   murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years    with the exception of the dreadful holy man   he appears to be on pace for a full fledged comeback    life was a great move on the part of murphy and co star martin lawrence   because it s a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap sticky drivel    director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own   and doesn t insert a distracting plot to back them up    life is   in a sense   one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other    amazingly   the scale never tips in either s favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other    as the movie opens   we re introduced to ray gibson   eddie murphy     a two timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club    there he meets a successful businessman named claude banks   martin lawrence      somehow   after multiple contrivances   the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run    when all is said and done   ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff    hence the setting of life   mississippi state prison   where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important   and become set on finding an fool proof escape plan    the film takes us from the 30 s all the way to the 90 s   presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude    luckily   rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic   academy award caliber manner    not only do we believe the characters look as if they re 90 years old   but they sound like it   too    murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles   even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards    this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it s sleeve    while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy   there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it s core    but the comedic aspects work wonderfully   wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars    the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama   but in both senses   it s an overwhelming delight    i could say a few bad things about the movie   but i don t want to    it s such a nice surprise   such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence   that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll    
Neg, five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there   is this starting to sound familiar     by mistake    the girls accidentlly open the box   big surprise   huh !   and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one   betcha didn t see that one coming !      hard to die   i found out while watching the film   is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2   nightie nightmare   r   a   m   r   #  1521      two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film   robyn harris and melissa moore   but they play different characters here    orville ketchum is also back as   get ready for this   orville ketchum   yes   the same character from number two      yes   he is also built like a tank in this film too    i m telling you   a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn t harm him at all !  the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act   well they seemed to have lost that ability    thankfully   for my sanity   i also saw the film warlock   which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film    the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks    any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line    the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out   analyzed   and discarded before it happens    there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot    while we are on the subject of the story   the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress    the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager s office    i m sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary   ridiculous   and hurts the story more   if that is still possible      the script for this film is completely pathetic    the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible    the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along    here is an example of the wonderful dialog    the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun    the line is   my dad used to be a marine   i bet i can work it      this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy    now   we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan     ! !     has been presented    one comment from an actress is   not a lot of strategy involved   but i like it      i m afraid folks that this is about as good as they get    now lets talk about the great special effects for this film    this obviously wasn t a big concern of the film makers    the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer s intelligence    a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie    are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get    the continuity department was obviously asleep   along with the viewers   when watching this film    in one shot   actress has cloths on   camera angle changes   actress seems to have lost clothing    very impressive trick !  the one   half      plus that this film has going for it   is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious    the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny   and so the viewer can get some enjoyment     ! !     from the film    however   this doesn t make it worth the rental fee of over a penny    in the acting department   the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down    i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic   but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least    oh well   win some   lose some    
Pos, in brief   best bleak comedy film since heathers    full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture    go see it !  so   i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on   hard copy   with pam smart   the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980 s       hard copy    s diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman s fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for    smart replied that she thought kidman s character came off as a dumb   vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal       smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband      smart s got a point    it wouldn t be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version    however   given a choice between the mass media  happening  of the real event and the fictionalized movie   i would definitely opt for the later    real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart   while pretty and alluring   is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman    to die for begins in a town called little hope   new hampshire   the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb    the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being  on tv      of course   one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry   played by matt dillon    but   with a little imagination   some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement   our heroine manages to overcome the nay sayers in her life   at least temporarily    kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne    i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture    her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates    kidman knows a star making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven   post feminist uber temptress from hell    she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue   which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way    at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister in law       you know     she knowingly exclaims     gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever   if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head      her husband beams at suzanne s profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters    this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven   folks    the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix    he plays jimmy   a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne s sexual favors    kidman s character   vapid though she is   is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia   winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland    phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen x slackerhood   as envisioned by tabloid tv   of course      his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain t going anywhere   ever    phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne   someone who actually noticed him    gus van sant   drugstore cowboy   my own private idaho   direction is first rate    he keeps the pacing in this not quite thriller snapping along    van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn t stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions    van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to  get it  without stopping to explain what is funny about this all american story    the screenplay   by buck henry   is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i ve heard since heathers    henry s story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame   yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters    henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini classic    danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric   loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands    either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick or treat parties    all in all   a wonderful production   well worth your seven bucks !  to die for   a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant    written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman   matt dillon   joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard    rated r   for language and mature themes       respect the r   not for under 14 s   rating       stars    go see it    
Pos, it s ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director s cut of the film    films such as aliens   the abyss   the wild bunch   blade runner   and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker s integrity   later chopped up or mucked with by the studio    the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films    the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson s 1995 masterpiece the professional   which is known as l   on around the world   is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director s cut    for years   i have heard of an   international   version available only in laserdisc format   which has eluded me for years    i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors  cuts   including l   on    but after countless searches in laserdisc stores   i could never find it    until now    the film follows the story of l   on   played by jean reno   a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello    he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12 year old girl named mathilda   played by then newcomer natalie portman   whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops    one day   a crew of the cops   lead by gary oldman in an over the top performance   kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries    taking pity on her   l   on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life    mathilda learns of l   on s hit man profession and decides to follow in l   on s footsteps as a   cleaner      she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l   on he has kept locked away as part of his profession    at this point   the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in    the international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l   on and mathilda   footage that american censors deemed   too explicit      i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle    the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda s and l   on s motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops    there s even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean hugues anglade   star of queen margot   besson s la femme nikita   and killing zoe    with these additional scenes replaced   l   on and matilda s relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version    the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes   the film becomes primarily a heavy   emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film    the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema    my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional   throw down twenty bucks   and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece    director/writer   luc besson producer   luc besson   claude besson starring   jean reno   natalie portman   gary oldman   danny aiello  
Pos, jay and silent bob strike back can rightfully be subtitled   kevin smith s greatest hits   for the film is comprised of numerous references and characters from smith s earlier works including   clerks   mall rats    chasing amy and dogma    so   be advised   bone up on that cinematic quartet in order to achieve the maximum enjoyment from smith s latest outing    kevin smith must be a very likable person because several good sports took a ton of kidding in this feature   most notably miramax   the studio whose subsidiary   dimension films   is jay and silent bob s distributor    others deserving accolades include ben affleck   matt damon   directors gus van zant and wes craven and the mighty george lucas    this is a laugh filled   foul mouthed road film with jay   jason mewes   and silent bob   smith   hitching to hollywood to sabotage miramax s production of bluntman and chronic   comic book characters based on the two jersey slackers    jay s convoluted reasoning is that if the film is shut down   people on the internet will stop insulting him and bob   even though it is not him and bob the people are dissing   but rather their comic book counterparts    no matter   the duo begin their long trek hitching rides across the country    but first they get some tips from a veteran hitchhiker   played by george carlin   who tells them to follow   the book     the rules of the road    of course jay s interpretation immediately gets the duo in trouble with a friendly nun   carrie fisher   who offers them a ride    jay and silent bob contains enough laughs that the movie s weaker aspects   which include a lame subplot about a girl gang of diamond thieves as well as a buffoonish federal park ranger played by will ferrell   can be easily tolerated    really   how can you not laugh at a film in which our heroes are picked up by the mystery van   and jay has a pot induced hallucination concerning velma and daphne    the movie s highlight   though   is near the finale    in hollywood   jay and silent bob sneak onto the miramax lot where they crash the set and are mistaken for extras of the latest affleck damon picture   good will hunting 2   hunting season    here we are privy to a hilarious conversation between affleck and damon in which the two put down each other s careers and film choices    and the laughs continue to grow    next up is jason   american pie   biggs and james   dawson s creek   van der beek   the actors chosen to portray bluntman and chronic    the pair mistake jay and silent bob for their stunt doubles    finally   comes a star wars homage featuring one of the stars of that legendary feature    this bit will leave you howling    smith s obvious affection for pop culture icons is evident in the way he shoots these scenes and handles his performers    he allows them to play it all tongue in cheek    their fun comes through the screen to the audience    it is too bad that this is jay and silent bob s swan song    the characters have grown since their supporting role debuts in clerks    but smith realizes that times have changed   and he doesn t want his creations to overstay their welcome    so smith has provided them with just the right kind of exit   saving the best for last    goodbye jay and silent bob    at least you re going out with a blast    
Neg, plot   upon the realization that they are failing all of their classes   two roommates try to find a third roomie who will kill himself   since the school s charter automatically grants top grades to the roommates of any student who succeeds in suicide    critique   despite this film s interesting premise and dark subject matter   this movie sucks because it is unfunny   boring   and presents us with one of tom everett scott s worst acting performances    add that to a completely unsuccessful romance element   many lame and corny jokes   a long wait for the setup   and an ending that takes all the blackness out of this   black comedy     if you re gonna create a black comedy   don t chicken out in the end see very bad things   8/10   for a perfect example     and you ve got yourself a trite mtv creation worthy of its own subject matter    i barely laughed at any gags   found the bong element contrived and repetitive   and was horrified not to find any gratuitous nudity tossed anywhere in this movie   if you re gonna make a bad college comedy   at least slap in some free t&a shots for the kids        this one s not even worth the rental   fellas    skip it altogether !  little known facts about this film and its stars   during auditions for that thing you do !   tom everett scott s first feature film role   director tom hanks was opposed to hiring tom because of the fact that scott could ve passed for hanks 15 years ago    it wasn t until hanks  wife rita wilson saw the audition tape   and decided he was cute   that hanks decided to risk hiring scott    the actor who played scott cooper in this film   mark paul gosselaar   is best known for having played the character of zack morris on tv s   saved by the bell      his parents are dutch and named hans and paula    and who would ve guessed that this is director alan cohn s first shot at directing a feature film    
Neg, so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci fi films such as close encounters of the third kind   2001   a space odyssey   apollo 13 and contact    well   whatever it is   you d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange   considering the disastrous results we re left with here    this is a film that takes a little bit of everything   but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing !  it s like i said       this  movie sucks    plot   a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020   after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet    critique   extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie    uneven   would be another    the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise   the buzz around it had been so so   and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes   all leading you to believe that it s actually going to go   somewhere      but it isn t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral   features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry colored planet   tries too hard to get us into the   pain   of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix    in a sci fi movie    well   i don t know   much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half   only to figure out some big secret in the end   a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement    ultimately   this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise   joins the crew in their   misadventures in space   for the main crux of its journey   and eventually settles down for one of the most anti climactic endings this side of contact    mind you   if you enjoyed that film s shrug of the shoulders ending   you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well    of course   i don t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story    ugh    what a friggin  mess    films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again    didn t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script    didn t they read the bad dialogue   the cheezy lines   the obvious derivative nature of the work   mind you   with a director like depalma at the helm   that ain t saying much !      of course   you can t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o connell in this fine crew of thespians     nuff said    neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film s musical score during the last fifteen minutes   presumably in order to wake the audience up   okay   we get it brian   this scene is supposed to be powerful       wow       yawn       my  ears hurt !      so is anything salvageable in this movie    sure    gary sinise does another great job   as does cheadle   the film doesn t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening   and yes   the   sand twister   effect that you see in the commercial is well done    other than that    i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies       oops    did i say   admire     i meant   am disgusted   !  all in all   this movie delivers very little in actual substance   offers two bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci fi mumbo jumbo   pretends to be deep when really it s just sappy   and eventually just settles into an ending which   other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story   gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck    go see the ninth gate       now  there s a great movie !  and on a personal note   i think it s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12 minute uninterrupted film sequences   and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting    
Neg, some movies i should just skip    my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back   and here comes another disney effects filled live action flick based on an old tv program    true   the probgram is only 15 years old this time   and it s a cartoon    but it s a cartoon i liked   and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen    but my daughter really wanted to go   and how bad could it be    turns out i was right   mostly    inspector gadget   oddly enough   follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian   down to the jive talking side kick    at first i thought it was done by the same people   but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin   where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver    this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it   where   formula   isn t just business   it s a way of life    the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits    in some parts you can just hear them saying   more zany !  i want more zany here    and    here         let s have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here    make it really painful    i want the audience squirming in their seats         ok   that s fine   but i want you to add bug guts         what does this scene do    character depth    but where s the zaniness    i don t see zany here    if you can t make it zany   cut it !    the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie    michelle   who plays penny   gadget s niece   shines in every scene she s in   but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time    my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor    dabney coleman s comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby    i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film   but instead   he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes    he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the   gidget bitch from hell   town mayor    oteri s overly enthusiastic and continually self congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland   oregon s own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn t poking fun at our fair town    or   maybe all career politicians are like that    i must say   matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla    he appears to have some fun with the film   especially as the evil gadget    rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw    joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself    her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film    d   l   hughley plays the shuckin  and jivin  vehicular side kick   in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years    the dialog is       let s face it   it s pretty bad    the tag line after a major set piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context    a lot of the lines   especially hughley s   appear to be made up as they go along   by people with little gift for ad lib    about three quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw    gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations   not really   battles     with the evil gadget    penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon    let me rage here just for a minute    michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character    she s utterly charming   and has excellent experience   harriet the spy   for the part of the pint size detective    why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery    the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting   or editing   stupidity    inspector gadget is missing the long   long stretches of potty humor that   among other things   made my favorite martian so unbearable   but it s a very short movie   so perhaps something was cut at the last moment    probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits    the   evil sidekick support group   is especially worth seeing   and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it s onscreen    all in all   another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films    i wonder if disney uses the revenues for it s generally money making cartoons to produce these losers    but if true   why    if they re trying for another mary poppins   they need to find a team that can produce one   and then give them a chance to do it    
Neg, there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space   it s just that none of them happen to be actors    the stars i m referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie s   outer space     the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home    yes   in terms of acting   the star power is            well   more like a falling star    kinda pretty   short lived   and pretty much dead    lost in space   as if you really didn t know   is based on the 60 s sci fi television series of the same name    it s the year 2058   and earth s precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population    john robinson   william hurt   is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet    earth s entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission   but nobody   whether it be john s family or hired battle pilot don west   matt leblanc     seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years    john s family consists of his wife maureen   mimi rogers     his atypical teenage daughter penny   lacey chabert     his ingenious son will   jack johnson     and his beautiful scientist daughter judy   heather graham      despite everyone s reluctance   the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space    unknown to anyone but the audience   there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission    dr   smith   gary oldman   has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour   and dr   smith has re programmed a talking robot to   destroy robinson family   !  when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides   the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination   and now the premise of being lost in space is complete    as for the audience   you will likely be lost in boredom by this point   wondering if the plot   like the jupiter 2   will ever get off the ground    it s hard to tell who deserves the most blame   the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script    chabert is basically the only one to overdo it   sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium    if you   like me   were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens   you re wrong !  that s just her normal voice !  in yet another example of a   friend   faltering on the big screen   leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming   make sense       it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod    graham is a babe   thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film    hurt   the black hole of excitement   sucks up any energy that might have been left    if hurt were available in tablet form   he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill    johnson isn t dull   he s just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody s ass all the time    want an example of how cool this kid can be    how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family    hey   don t laugh   the thing actually listened to the mr   rogers would be proud sentiment    but alas   if you thought a character couldn t be much worse   there was rogers as the epitome of generic   or   mother as she was known      why hire an actress    they could ve had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it    now that would ve had some pizzazz !  lost in space luckily doesn t suffer in every single category that it could have    the special effects are crisp   clear   and at least mildly captivating   unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman   who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse    unfortunately   oldman is locked away for most of the film   giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy    while the special effects are pleasing to the eye   they are nothing you couldn t find in most modern sci fi films    contact   for example   far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination    lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art   with numerous contradictions   the time travel aspect was horribly flawed !     wooden and corny acting   worse dialogue   and an ending so disappointing   you d be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens    then again   with an ending like this film has   it s obvious a sequel is already being considered    what an awful note to end on   knowing there could be more of this in a year or two    the attempt to be family oriented is commendable   but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups    well   danger potential movie goers !  danger !  this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity    
Neg, these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes    but   only a few years ago   before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice   sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers    sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south    the way to regain popularity and prestige   they thought   was the use the same formulas   characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place    one of such celebrity was eddie murphy   black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade    in order to return to the spotlight   he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film   beverly hills cop   1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987    seven years later   for the third instalment   he used the directorial service of john landis   another fading star   with whom he successfully collaborated twice   in trading places and coming to america    this time   however   third time wasn t the charm and beverly hills iii was failure    eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback    eddie murphy here plays axel foley   fast talking streetwise detroit policeman   who raids illegal chop shop    the routine police action ends in tragedy   when the criminals kill foley s boss    determined to bring the killers to justice   foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald   timothy carhart      when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles   foley goes back to los angeles    there   with the help of his old friend   local policeman rosewood   judge rheinhold     foley would clash with money counterfeit ring    ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different    in this decade   the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills   which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film   simply doesn t work    screenwriter steven e   de souza provides another conflict   this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business like professionalism of the bad guys    since foley belongs to the former   his character had to watch his language   and the tone of the film in general is more infantile    unfortunately   this film still belongs to action movie genre   and there is too much violence for little children    nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning   which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath    unlike donner with the lethal weapon series   landis simply can t balance the comedy with   regular   action   and the result is a film that fails in both aspects    action scenes are sometimes interesting   but not too spectacular   at the end   scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself     humour   on the other hand   falls flat    to make even worse   some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure   especially art expert turned into arms dealer   played by bronson pinchot      in the end   although the film provided some entertainment   viewers   at least critical ones   would probably be happy to know that there aren t any plans for beverly hills iv

Pos, while watching boiler room   i was constantly reminded of last year s masterpiece fight club    both films consist of a predominately male cast    both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires    and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator   who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped    while boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club   he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation    a generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire    paying homage to oliver stone s 1987 classic wall street   younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger   hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older   more experienced types    as is true in real life   younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology    boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages    another similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks    some people are convinced that an all male cast automatically means there must be gory violence   here is proof that this is not true    if you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck   go see reindeer games this weekend    if you want to see a smart   insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script   see boiler room    giovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film s narrator   seth    after dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment   seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man   nicky katt      he agrees to take the job   in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years   of selling stock to well off americans from the mid west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co workers    learning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production   seth figures this is too good to be true    after stumbling into a room at the wrong time   he knows there is something no good about this company    at this point   seth is left with the ultimate choice   continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on    ribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin   playing seth s dad    the two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves    the transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film    the supporting cast of greedy co workers is also flawless    ben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company   nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth   and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt    the energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring    the only major error in the film is that nothing major happens    there is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable    due to the lack of a major event   boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into    the movie is not intense enough to be a thriller   the romantic segments involving seth and abby   nia long   are not properly finalized   and the dialogue isn t funny enough to make it a comedy    in having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole   boiler room is slightly confused at times    it doesn t seem to know which category to fit itself into    one satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better    otherwise   the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors    
Pos, with the abundance of trite   recycled movies in the late  90s   there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers   never mind movie critics   for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original   perhaps audaciously   perhaps purely thematically    for the former   you need look no further than director tom tykwer s incredible german thriller run lola run   a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards    lola   a contemporary goth girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day    it seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks   and if he doesn t deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes   he will be killed    this gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100   000 marks   or her boyfriend dies    so she runs    not just jogs   sprints    in hopes that somehow   someway   she ll be able to obtain the money and save a life    >from there   as critic steve rhodes described it   run lola run plays a bit like   sliding doors on steroids    with a non stop techno soundtrack   wierd camerawork   all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace   anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something    indeed   the movie is often outrageously exciting   as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious    very much like titanic   run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film    the way the movie is made   for pure visual style   tykwer s movie is breathtaking   literally   sometimes      thematically it does leave something to be desired   it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash    while you are watching   this will not matter    running a breezy 81 minutes   this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted    it is the equivalent of a roller coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers       1999 eugene novikov&#137    
Pos, america has finally gotten what it s needed for years   a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics and charisma    regretfully it s only a movie    president james marshall   harrison ford   is fed up with terrorist activities    teaming up with the russian government   he orders a strike force capture of alexander radek   a reactionary general ready to re unite the soviet union under his fascist reign    during a celebration dinner   marshall announces to the world that he will send troops to fight oppression wherever it exists       it s your turn to be afraid     he declares    returning home on air force one   he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally    ultra nationalist militants loyal to radek and lead by ivan korshunov   gary oldman   hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until the general is released    marshall has a chance to escape in a jettisoned capsule   which clinton says doesn t exist in real life   but refuses   preferring to stay and fight    director wolfgang peterson     das boot       in the line of fire       outbreak   takes the over used   die hard   theme and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with hold your breath intensity    if you can take your eyes off the screen   steal a look at the audience    everyone is totally engrossed    the two actors do what they do best and they are probably the best there are at it    oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist and no wonder    he does it so well    when he engages the teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead   you know that he s over the edge in the manner that people with a cause can become    you are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any time    when korshonov executes passengers   there is a frightening reality to it    the guns in this film are deadly weapons   not cartoons    harrison ford has done one role for several years    his mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here    marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job    realistically   he s a man afraid   but not afraid to act    ford is one of the few actors that could make us believe that the president of the united states could be an action hero    indiana jones in the oval office    he and oldman s archetypes match up perfectly    the other roles also go to accomplished actors    glenn close as the determined but unsure vice president is the picture of an executive forced into a position that she s not quite ready for    dean stockwell as defense secretary eager for the authority     i m in charge here !      is her political nemesis and turns in a good alexander haig performance    of course the politics are all wrong    a cowboy president   even down to his name   with big guns shoots his way through problems    much like the american collective memory of jfk s camelot   the image is wondrous if you don t look too deep    the pulls on the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film   but they work here    no matter what political spin you put on the story   the movie is an outstanding one    i left the theater feeling that there is hope for the country s future   not a common belief nowadays    now if we only can get ford to run for president    just because one actor didn t work out as chief executive doesn t mean that a different one couldn t       michael redman has lost count of how many years he s been writing this column    21 years       22 years    while watching the sunflowers outside his window swaying in the cool breezes      
Neg, any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it    unfortunately   this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible   directed by brian depalma    the first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever   aside from the music    the tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork   orchestrated by jim phelps   allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world    teamwork was the key    this film is set up as a cross between james bond and depalma s   blow out     where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions    it was travolta s vulnerability that made that film so exciting and claustrophobic    in this film   tom cruise is basically omniscient   believe that     and so there s no fun going on here whatsoever    the story is about as contrived as contrived gets   and is full of holes    there are basically two memorable sequences   one involves breaking into a kubrickesque computer room    a task that could have been made much easier had the characters a whit of common sense   suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is in the room     the second involves a high speed train   a helicopter   and the chunnel and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved    the actors are all miscast   especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife   who cannot act   and ving rhames as a computer hacker   !     who looks lost and embarrased to be in this movie    tom cruise is no james bond   and jon voight looks more like bobby   the brain   heenan than jim phelps    brian depalma s career has been bafflingly erratic    at his best   he beats hitchcock at his own game     blow out       carrie       body double     but this is not his best    the screenplay was partly written by robert towne   who wrote the best scenario of the seventies in   chinatown     but this script is perfunctory at best   and terrrible at worst    the cinematography has a comic book red/blue emphasis   which is nice to look at   but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed and this movie even features the old   killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time to think of an escape   trick    please don t spend your money on this   it ll only encourage hollywood to make more

Pos, i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago   picking up the grand jury prize at the festival     holocaust comedy receives standing ovation    the headlines read    intrigued by this statement   i looked up information on the film and found that   sure enough   life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years    even though the movie was extremely well received by critics and public alike   i couldn t help but be disgusted at this notion   human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated    only now do i see the error of my ways    after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time   it became clear that it is not   as the headlines proclaimed   a   holocaust comedy     on the contrary   life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps    rather   it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son   who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation    roberto benigni   who also wrote and directed the movie   stars as guido orefice   a chaplin inspired clown and all round jolly guy who   as the film opens   is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher   nicoletta braschi   benigni real life spouse      through the course of the first hour or so   we see guido striving to get the attention of this   beautiful princess     as he calls her    employing the magic of laughter   the italian comedian wins her heart and together   they raise a young boy named giosue   child actor giorgio cantarini      life treats them well until hitler s minions rise to power   and the family is whisked away to a german camp   where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son s innocence no matter what the sacrifice    granted   it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp   but it does not pull a   hogan s heros   and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews    somehow   it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it s gravely serious subject    so   we ve established that life is beautiful is not a   holocaust comedy      but   there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me    the film   despite critic s declarations of it being a   triumph of the human spirit     is no such thing   not in my eyes   anyway    some have called the story an   affirmation of the beauty of life     but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy    the film s ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently   but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting    essentially   life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film    however   i am not denying the movie s greatness    believe me   it s fantastic    i m just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as    but perhaps i m reading more into the movie than is really there    maybe the film s brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit    in fact   maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it

Pos, shakespeare   you hardly understood it in high school    why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn t count on it    if this is your attitude   then i ll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh s hamlet is probably not for you   and you might as well stop reading right now    if   however   you are a lover of the bard   or at the very least are open minded about a challenging script   read on   for there is something rotten in the state of denmark    namely   the king has died   and his widow the queen has wed the king s brother   claudius   but prince hamlet suspects foul play    his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother s hands    hamlet   enlisting the help of his friend horatio   conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery         and  the game is afoot          the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes    with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england   also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers     the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established    interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers    the hamlet castle s grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings   mirror panel doors   and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second story loft    costuming is equally grand   drawing upon both history and imagination      not quite the denmark of the 1600 s   the characters  attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia   very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel    it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars   respectively    in addition to directing   kenneth branagh also plays the title character    as the revenge driven royal heir   branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows    from the anticipation of seeing his father s ghost   to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester   to his eventual wrath   branagh delivers in spades    every scene truly revolves around hamlet   as much a tribute to branagh s acting and directing as to shakespeare s manuscript    hamlet seems to be a who s who of shakespearean trained actors   so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself    julie christie   as hamlet s mother gertrude   and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly   as do many of the supporting players    kate winslet as hamlet s lover ophelia   does an outstanding job demonstrating the character s plummet to the depths of dispair and madness    richard briers as ophelia s father   polonius   and michael moloney as her brother   laertes   are equally convincing    nicholas farrell as hamlet s trusted friend horatio   and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast    hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible    in some cases   this made for interesting scenes    billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick   whom hamlet knew quite well    crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian   and the result is a very funny scene    however   charleton heston   whom many might think would butcher shakespeare   is the biggest surprise of all    as the player king   the leader of a troupe of traveling actors   he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba    part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story   with sir john gielgud and judi dench     but this is most unfortunate   for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time    his off camera speaking   while gripping   sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well voiced actor    i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out   and let the venerable actor have the attention    unfortunately   there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions    jack lemmon   an excellent actor   just can t do shakespeare    as marcellus   the guard who sees the elder hamlet s ghost   lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him    gerard depardieu   another talented actor   is wasted when given little more than the utterances of   yes   my lord   and   no   my lord   in the role of reynaldo    richard attenborough has a   literally   walk on role   showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador    i think he had two lines    then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway    when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year   two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was    if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome   well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you    hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one    branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback type images    this only works about half the time   and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them    you don t have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare   but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly    the alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar   the high school english course    in it   you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king s english    or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes    
Neg, the   disney stick to what you do best   rule states that disney s animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at live action kids  entertainment   they will fail miserably    this goes double for occasions when they try to make a live action adaptation of a popular cartoon   remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations    i m still trying to forget      that rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget   an insulting   despicable and   worst of all   expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable children s film    it will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults   even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes    it s films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects    just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet   his career takes a nosedive to hell with his   role   as john brown   a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around him    he dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush   dr   brenda bradford   joely fisher      but after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer    john breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr   brenda s father    dr   brenda has been working on a   gadget project     which would make a half man half machine super policeman to fight crime    feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject   realizing his dream of becoming a policeman    now   when he says   go go gadget [insert name of gizmo here]   he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks   bang up bandits and mangle murderers    in the meantime   the evil claw   rupert everett     the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor s father is building a gadget of his own   a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown s worst nemesis    claw has plans of world domination   which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile   voice of d   l    hughley   to save humanity from his wrath    state of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere    had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect    what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal   all of the expensive f/x amounts to nothing    part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie    can kids really admire a hero so goody two shoes that he screams   hey !  you ran a stop sign !    while hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle    i think that today s children will respond better to somebody dashing   someone ultra cool    they   probably   receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt    in addition to the more complex complaints above   there s also the simple stuff   inspector gadget is boring   formulaic and achingly implausible    there s no feeling that the director really cares about his story   more than any other film i ve seen this year   this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line    there s a popular commercial   for sprite   but that s irrelevant   running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects    it consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious   thank god   movie called   death slug      each executive gleefully presents a different merchandise tie in   slug taco !  slug on a stick !      at the end one of them asks   what about the movie      another answers     well   we don t have a script yet   but we can bang one out by friday      they probably could have replaced   death slug   with inspector gadget    this film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script    it s no coincidence that most good children s entertainment these days comes from animation    animated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride into their work    these kinds of films are banged out quicker and a good percentage turn out worthless   sloppy and impersonal    the studios are becoming factories and films their assembled products       1999 eugene novikov&#137    
Neg, the best thing    in fact   the only good thing    i can say about dark city is that it made me want to go see l   a   confidential again    or go rent body heat   to see william hurt do some real noir    or even    god help me    palmetto    alex proyas s new movie screams atmosphere    i screamed   too     get me out of this theater !    new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors   and doesn t have any way to get it back    i paid $4   25 for a matinee screening and don t have any way to get my money back   either    you ll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie    i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning   nightmarish future world where it s always a late night in 1948   complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras    i ve got news for you fellows    i don t care how hard you worked   or how visually stunning this movie looks    you wasted your time and mine   working on a movie without a plot   without a clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go   without a soul or a reason to care    the movie starts out oh so promising    john murdoch   rufus sewell   is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life   would have been boarded up long ago    there is a dead   mutilated prostitute in the other room    a surprise   as he has lost his memory    the phone rings   it s a sinister sounding man   claiming to be his doctor   telling him to flee for his life    all well and good   right    wrong    apparently   someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot       this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood      so   the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life   rather   it s a voice over narration by the aforementioned doctor   keifer sutherland   explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible    it s as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca    no   wait   that s not fair to casablanca    it s more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show    or if you want to know how i really feel   having an off screen narrator explain that gilligan won t be getting off the island in this episode    >from here   the coherence of the plot goes down faster than   insert monica lewinsky joke here      the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason   and that s what moves the plot    what we re left with is a string of unanswered questions that don t make any sense    we re given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers   yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed    we re given a hero who can   tune   into these same powers   yet he only uses them when it s convenient to the plot    we re given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere  usually   critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part   isn t given much to do      in this movie   no one is given anything to do    sewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesn t remember anything   and plays it like        um        a man who doesn t remember anything    the aliens are tall   pasty faced   and bald   and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they re evil    and there s a child alien as well   straight out of an anne rice novel    sutherland is saddled with a limp   a twitchy eye   and a breathy accent to remind us that he s in league with the aliens    to its credit   dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting    william hurt is perfectly cast as the world weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city    jennifer connelly   playing sewell s love interest   is given two all too brief moments on screen as a lounge singer    and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit    but instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script   the way they would be in any self respecting noir movie   they re almost tangiential to the plot   such as it is    the problem with dark city is this   it s a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir    the essence of film noir isn t   as proyas seems to beleive   breathy dialogue or snap brim fedoras or tall   bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner    dark city has not one bit of intrigue   moral ambiguity   suspense   or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics    dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic    it s an exceptionlly well made and intricately designed piece of flotsam   sailing around and around the middle of the ocean   going nowhere    
Neg, the general s daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we ll see this year    or perhaps the stupidest clever film    it s confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction    that   however   is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller    the punched up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general s daughter has a brain in its head   even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense    our hero is warrant officer paul brenner   a brash investigator for the u   s   army s criminal investigation division    his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell   leslie stefanson   at a georgia base   the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation    complicating the case is the fact that capt   campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell   james cromwell     a war hero and potential vice presidential nominee    general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press   which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in    teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill   madeleine stowe      who   coincidentally enough   once had a romantic relationship with brenner    brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain s past that make the case ever more sordid    if only the sordidness were the worst of the general s daughter s problems    scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary   their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered light sleaze    director simon west likely thinks he s covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers   but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches   which is the film s fatal flaw    it s a trend he continues for two hours   taking the story s few virtues and slapping a coat of moron proof obviousness over them    characters who may   wink wink   turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow   cutaway inserts of the captain campbell s still living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five minute attention spans    west just can t help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general s daughter    he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow fade edits    bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell    the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell s mentor   a psychological warfare expert named moore   james woods      there s something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another    indeed   travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures   to the local sheriff of the georgia county     shouldn t you be out night sticking the colored folk          even the lame device of brenner and sunhill s sexual history provides a few winning zingers    goldman s dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you ll find in most so called comedies    dialogue   unfortunately   just isn t enough to make a quality script    it s difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner   an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene   and too lucky for it to last any longer   not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye      by the time the general s daughter wanders towards its over wrought   psycho in the rain finale   west s heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun    it s silly and pretentious film making   but at least it provides a giggle or five    goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand up routine    
Pos, the happy bastard s 30 second review  big daddy  happy gilmore as a father    of course !  that s the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy   a movie that s passable but isn t really considered some of sandler s best work    he doesn t actually play happy gilmore in the movie   but a variation of him    he s sonny coufax   a man who s living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one day a week gig as a tollbooth man   tollbooth willie        his girlfriend   kristy swanson   is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him    enter a 5 year old kid   who s mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate   jon stewart     who s off in china on a business trip    from there   coufax basically acts as the kid s father   teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks    he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker   joey lauren adams     but   somehow   he also garners the attention of social services   who aren t particularly pleased with coufax s actions   as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid    the reason i say it s not really sandler s best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie   showing some odd feelings that somehow didn t really belong in a sandler vehicle    i mean   it fits the movie s tone and everything   and sandler handles it well   but it s just oddly placed   that s all    fortunately   it doesn t destroy the goofy glee path it s been following and it still makes you feel good    sandler does a good job here   as he does in most of his movies    rob schneider   however   is irritating as his friend   an immigrant delivery boy who can t read    stewart   in his minor time on screen   is great   and adams remains a joy to watch    look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum    he s a hoot    directed by dennis dugan   director of happy gilmore     the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with    again   there are faults   but   hey   everyone needs to get emotional sometimes    
Pos, the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily    three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making    they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house    from there   things become a little more complicated    i can say   with absolute assurance   that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me    although i know it was all a staged   mockumentary     there s no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you    i didn t feel much upon initially watching it    i just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts    i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend    i ve gotten chills every time i ve brought it up since then    this is not a movie that hits you right away    instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine   waits until you think everything is okay   then it slowly starts to creep it s way up into your mind    this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch    the film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film   so don t expect any steadi cam shots or fancy camera work    this is as real as it gets folks    i don t recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though   because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera    the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real   you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not    this is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing   especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera    the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape to film transfer done for the big screen    word has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras   hours of deleted scenes   alternate endings   commentary   the sci fi channel special   and others   is being planned for release    i urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvd s    i know i ll be first in line to buy one    [r]  
Neg, there re so many things to criticize about i don t know where to start    recommendation   turn off your brain   don t be like me   decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much    a comet is about to strike earth   causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event   e   l   e     that wiped out the dinosaurs    what follows is the story of a president s bid to think for the good of his people   a rising reporter   the love story of two teenagers   one of whom discovered the comet     and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah  to save the world    firstly   there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film   nor is there anything outstandingly good about it     but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid    to be honest   i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself   which isn t saying much      mimi leder s follow up to `the peacemaker  is equally incompetent   with all the big stars wasted       perhaps i m just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker  in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller   `the assignment       it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision   but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives    however   the film simply fails on that note    the effects are worn out   the substandard screenplay limited the acting   and the director continued her sad run in terms of good film making credentials    she s still making good money though    t   a leoni s unfortunate character   the news reporter   is the foundation of the story and of the cast    but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored    robert duvall s aging astronaut is lifeless   and morgan freeman s president is restricted to   well   a righteous president   which means he s not interesting at all      leoni s character is the only appealing one   and is played with reasonable conviction   but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc     but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters    warning   spoilers included   but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway      plot holes   plot holes   plot holes    now   e   l   e    is threatening to exterminate more than 99% of the human race   and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there    where s the logic    leder could have at least made it plausible with 20    and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish   and those less selfish ones   the ones that stayed at home   were the victims    the film was almost mocking them   telling them they had died for nothing    i also fail to see how two teenagers   carrying a baby   would be the first to climb up the mountain/hill   even with a motorbike for a head start    it s unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle   but that doesn t really matter    building caves was a strategy mentioned in `dr    strangelove    which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years    now that is a more practical use for caves    what is the point of living in caves    there is no   unlike `dr    strangelove    any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure    how do plants grow    if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves   there s no reason why they can t do it in the open    the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves    obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago   and you can t be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media    in an important mission like that of the `messiah    for that matter any mission   it is impossible that isn t sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres   needless to say tens of kilometres    this is not deep impact   it s a frivolous cheap impact    but even with all that   some overacting   and a 3   4 rating   it s still watchable   just don t think about it    okay    
Neg, walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox s anastasia    but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios   the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about    disney s recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas   the hunchback of notre dame   and to a lesser extent   hercules    with anastasia   fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window    some may say   so what    it s just a kid s movie    well        if you have young kids   beware   as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse rotting rasputin zombie   whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way    consider yourselves warned    nevertheless   the animation is quite stunning at times    don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout   occasionally rivalling photographic quality    and yet in other scenes   the hand drawn material seems of the saturday morning tv crowd   which leads me to wonder        was this rushed to market to combat disney    the plot   as anyone who had read history before knows   concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916    not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened    as for the plot     go rent disney s candleshoe    you ll see 60% of anastasia there    
Neg, yet another brainless teen flick   this one is about   surprise   drugs and sex    stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn t look more bored    their characters are cardboard cut outs of every cliched teenager out there    one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie    everything about it annoyed the hell out of me    the acting   and script   the plot   and ending    the director   of the fluke hit swingers   could have very well directed a bunch of no name actors and had a watchabe film    the   big   stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality    i felt like i was watching dawson s creek episode 200    although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast    the   surprise   ending was sooo predictable    since when is a male character s sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore      go is dawson s creek + varsity blues   she s all that = go home and watch something else    
Pos,    a breed apart   casts rutger hauer as a crazy   bird loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner    a bit hard to swallow    that s only the first of many improbabilities in this film    hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe   while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector    turner is the woman caught between the two men       a breed apart   isn t a bad movie   exactly    indeed   i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters   even though their goals couldn t be more different    the problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies    for example   early on in the film   hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at   his   birds    later on   the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people   and hauer kills a few of them    i have a tough time believing that the police wouldn t get involved at that point    another problem is the silly love triangle that develops    i didn t care one way or the other who ended up with turner    i was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions    however   despite this uninteresting sub plot   turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes there s more to life than money and birds    as for hauer   he s an actor i ve always admired    he has a penchant for picking strange and unusual characters    and this one is no exception    he s frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse   wearing pirate s clothing   and holstering a cross bow    despite all his eccentric mannerisms   though   hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through    for example   there s a scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island a day early    he comes off as crazy loner in that scene   but a few minutes later   he is apologizing to turner   and we believe his intentions    soon after   we find out he s a vietnam vet   and his actions become fairly clear to us       a breed apart   isn t a great movie by any means   but it does contain good performances by all three leads   and it s worth seeing for that reason alone    
Pos, a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today s youth seem attracted to black culture    the review  if black & white   the new film from writer/director james toback   is eventually remembered for only one thing   it will be the revelation that brooke shields   claudia schiffer   marla maples and mike tyson can act    however   this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that    black & white is a fascinating film   it makes a statement about america s youth and hip hop culture without getting heavy handed overly serious    featuring a cast of known commodities   ben stiller   robert downey jr     and hot newcomers   singers bijou phillips     toback s is a complex film worth seeing    black & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other   a la robert altman    there is dean the basketball player   allan houston   who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear   stiller   in exchange for fifty grand a game    this eventually spills over into the life of dean s long time friend rich   power     a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem    rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white owned club on his turf    meanwhile   the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager   shields   and her gay husband terry   downey jr        others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will   joe pantoliano as his district attorney father   jared leto as a high school teacher   marla maples as the mother of one of hip hop crazed teens   claudia schiffer as dean s girlfriend   and mike tyson as        mike tyson    the stories ebb and flow through the film   losing and gaining prominence over time    friendships are lost   lovers are gained   and there is an occasional burst of violence    originally rated nc 17 in the united states   black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls    while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating   viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing    the three way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for   and several audience members got up and left at that point    the frequent sex is one of the film s few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film    to toback s credit   the level of violence in black & white is almost nil    these gangstas and hip hop artists are given real problems and concerns   and only become gun toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way    whenever a character finds himself on donager s handheld digital camera   he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence   but not everyone has fully bought into the idea    charlie   phillips   is full of bluster about why she loves hip hop   but admits that   in ten years time   i ll be way over this      these youth know they are going through a phase   and are simply enjoying it    toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny    most of the humour comes from mike tyson   who provides the film s comic relief without really trying    he is given big words like vernacular to say   and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson   he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better   playing on tyson s image as a dimwit    but tyson also gets the film s scariest moment    as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry   tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm    the scene is entirely improvised   with downey jr   being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction    the reaction he gets   being slapped and then choked is astonishing   as downey jr s face turns a frightening shade of purple    black & white is a film about hip hop culture   and the film s omnipresent hip hop soundtrack strongly supports this    but toback keeps things from becoming too serious   by moving from story to story as quickly as he does   toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character s struggle    thus black & white s message about hip hop becomes secondary to the film itself    toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip hop along the way    and we do    
Pos, after being hypnotized   a man believes there is a ghost in his house    the review  two low key summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year   the blair witch project and the sixth sense    each has made well over $100 million in north america   based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising    if a film s box office take were based primarily on its quality   stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected   for it is as scary   if not scarier than the other two    writer/director david koepp has given artisan entertainment   the folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit    the story gets going after tom witzky   bacon     an average blue collar dad   gets hypnotized by his wife maggie s   erbe   sister lisa   douglas   at a party    while the hypnosis goes as expected to the party goers   it triggers something in tom s head    things begin to change around him   blinking red lights let off a strange hum   for example     and he fights to stay in control of his own senses    where these experiences take tom   maggie and their son jake   cope     who tom thinks might have some answers   is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you    david koepp keeps the action localized   the majority of the action takes place at tom s house or just down the street    by keeping things at home   koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues   montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc        unfortunately   the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity    humour can take the tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting    several tense moments become completely diffused by a few misplaced jokes    also   there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved   though to mention them would be to give too much away    kevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man losing his sanity admirably    his total lack of understanding of what is happening to him is believable   as are the reactions from his wife maggie    kathryn erbe is given a role meatier and better written than that of most   wife who can no longer handle her husband   parts    while it is still a supporting role   her maggie is moving as she watches both her husband and her son enter what she calls   a private club that i m not invited to     where they whisper about things all day long    as jake   zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense   but gets less screen time    both children manage the same trick   making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way things are    fans of blair and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes    it combines the dread of blair   a creepy closed in feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy and great performances by the whole cast   specifically bacon   to give the fall its first genuine scary film    if only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot a bit more   this could have been one of the year s best    
Neg, all through its production and into the early days of its initial   aborted pre release publicity   hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood    ultimately   however   paramount pictures   nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996 s other   underperforming disaster films   dante s peak   volcano     changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year    but   to paraphrase the bard   swill   by any other name   would smell as rank    no number of name changes can help this picture    it s not just about a disaster   it is a disaster    hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute    the best shot occurs during the opening credits   as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg   indiana as the water level slowly rises    the community   protected by an overworked dam   is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud choked skies    from that moment on   it s all downhill    whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point    it takes forever to get to the end credits    this is one of the longest seeming 95 minute motion pictures i have recently endured    basically   hard rain is one extended   dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot outs    there s a lot of water   broken glass   gunfire   and explosions    it s all very routine and uninteresting because there aren t any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense    the film s conclusion is so preposterous that it s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around    action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion    graham yost   the writer of both speed and hard rain   surely understands that principle    unfortunately   neither he   nor cinematographer turned director mikael salomon   a far off place     applies it    the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition    we see the same kinds of things    speedboat chases   flood damage   shoot outs   etc      over and over again    the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length    the storyline gives us a number of paper thin characters in contrived circumstances    there s tom   christian slater     the one  dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash    he and his partner   charlie   edward asner   tv s   lou grant       get stuck on a street that s rapidly turning into a river    a group of men   led by jimmy   morgan freeman     arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers    after charlie is killed in a shoot out   tom hides the money   then runs    as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg s roads   he encounters some of the locals   karen   minnie driver     a would be love interest   a bickering old couple   richard dysart and betty white     who are on hand to provide comic relief   and the easily corrupted sheriff   randy quaid     whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives    there isn t any real acting in this film    christian slater utters a few lame one liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera    tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen    randy quaid sneers a lot   and is totally unconvincing    morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances   but they are defeated by the script    freeman   one of the best cinematic thespians working today   looks suitably embarrassed to be here   but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time to time    following in the wake of twister   this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn t trust nature s fury as the chief engine of conflict    as a result   we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had    titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water    hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible    thus far this year   hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire   firestorm   and water   hard rain      fortunately   there are only two elements left    
Pos, capsule   this is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film   set in the present    robert deniro stars as a risk adverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend   played by marlon brando      edward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime    the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense       +2    4 to +4    i am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before    this is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens    there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment    there is no rock score    there are no ballet  like martial arts    this is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and un flashy script    nick   played by robert deniro   is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks    if a job is not a safe bet   pun intended     he backs out    sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe    when one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game    he returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club   and decides to manage it full time    he proposes to his girl friend diane   angela bassett      she has one condition    he must stay retired from crime    but before the deal can be cemented   max   a montreal kingpin and personal friend   has one last supposedly easy job for nick    nick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal    more and more details seem to complicate the job    nick s partner in the crime is to be a smart   but uncontrollable young crook   jack   edward norton      jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat   even at his associates  homes    the young crook is a know it all who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way    together they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house    the script by kario salem   lem dobbs   and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old   mission impossible   television series    we see pieces of the heist being put together   last minute changes   and things that go wrong   much like a good episode of   mission impossible      this team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise   mission impossible   films    the complications are   however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable    the telling is cold and noirish   which is just what it is supposed to be    director frank oz   the voices of yoda and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a serious crime film    the score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scene stealing acting    edward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is low key by today s standards    he plays what is nearly a double role    jack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house    one nice        character i have not mentioned is stephen   jamie harrold      stephen is a master hacker who lives in his mother s basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions    he seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon    the film itself remains low key up until the time of the climactic heist    then the pace really picks up    before that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes    though oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet and lowdown    on the subject of music   the score of the score is by howard shore    it adds tension to the suspense scenes   but never seems to have much of a melody    angela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role that should have been played by a less famous actress who needed a break    she has nothing to do in the film but demand that nick give up crime and to look like an attractive reward if he does    speaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s and 1960s    it does the job    i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the  4 to +4 scale    
Neg, ever since wargames   the first real computer hacking movie   hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking    these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous    if it s not this   the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect    hackers is guilty of all of these crimes    to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet   most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can t take it anymore    those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web   the internet movie database   are probably aware of the section for movies entitled   goofs      this is the section for mistakes in the movies    well   imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed     generally ill informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology      and truthfully   this is one hundred percent correct    the plot   obviously   centers around computer hacking    more specifically   it follows the exploits of dade murphy   a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller    miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting   because if it were not for that   who knows where his career would be now after hackers    the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems    he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old    the film then picks up at that point   an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer    dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn   angelina jolie     cereal killer   matthew lillard     lord nikon   laurence mason     and the phantom phreak   renoly santiago     who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible   hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi    oh   and as a little sub plot   dade also tries to woo acid burn   the only female hacker in the film    really   i can t think of much more to say about the film s plot aside from what i ve said    it s just a bunch of computer geeks   no   obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality   running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi    thanks to this movie   the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do    this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time   and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list    to sum it up   hackers is a terrible computer film    if you re looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world   i suggest sneakers    although at times it too may seem a little far fetched   it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users    hopefully   this film didn t influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time    
Neg, for   original sin     the road to the screen has been rocky    initially slated for release last november   the film was bumped twice   finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001    advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics   generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands    so is   original sin   really all that bad    yes it is   but the melodrama does offer some rewards    the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a   with angelina jolie providing the   t   and antonio banderas the   a        more importantly   the movie is entertainingly bad    veteran readers know that   as a rule   i don t encourage people to patronize lousy films    most of the time   there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides   the   let s go laugh at the failings of others   mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable    but things are different this summer    quality films   to put it mildly   have been few and far between   so as far as i m concerned   it s fair to find our kicks where we may       original sin   will never join such treasures as   valley of the dolls       road house   and   showgirls   in the bad movie hall of fame   but it ll do until something worse comes along    the film   adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel     waltz into darkness     which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film     mississippi mermaid       opens in a turn of the century prison   as jolie s character   slated for a dawn execution   tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny    the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like     this is not a love story   it is a story about love      wary of local gold diggers   cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas   banderas   makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america   listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold diggers    a practical man   luis chooses a frumpy looking lady   hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children    imagine his surprise when his fianc   e   julia russell   jolie     turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo    julia explains that she sent a different woman s image because she didn t want to be selected solely for her pretty face    luis then confesses his deception   leading julie to state   with great significance     we have something in common   we are both not to trusted      after their wedding   luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking   with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible    jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun   although the filmmakers  insistence on using one of banderas  legs to cover jolie s crotch makes it look like he s trying to climb her    luis   the stupidest man who ever lived   immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia   despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded    his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up    luis must force julia to write to her sister emily   who is frantic over her lack of communication    shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird   it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck    finally   when she cleans out his accounts and disappears   luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong    incidentally   if you re afraid i m giving too much away   rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie   leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists   a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass    along the way   private detective walter downs   played by thomas jane   who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie   61 *     turns up   hired by the frumpy woman s sister to find out what happened to the real julia    luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist   having decided that if he can t have her   he will kill her    oh   the pathos of it all    the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story   adjusting their performances accordingly    banderas is suitably impassioned   while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting   and with those lips   she can really pout      as for thomas jane   he starts off acting suspicious and cagey   then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness    his most startling moment comes when   to prove his power to humiliate   he forces luis against a wall   verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full on kiss    if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape   show them this chilling scene    and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler   show them   original sin      
Pos, for a movie about disco era excess     54   comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club    think of it as a sort of   boogie nights    lite   where that similarly structured and  set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift     54   leaves the kinkier details to your imagination    it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter   but it thankfully never resorts to preaching   either    in fact   were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment     54   would be about as feathery as the time period s popular female hairstyle    studio 54 was a haven for the rich   famous and generally good looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986    inside   anything went and   we are told   everything did    the film s fictional main character is shane o shea   ryan phillippe   the jerky jock from   i know what you did last summer       a fresh faced 19 year old who dreams of venturing beyond the club s velvet rope and coming face to face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines    his wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell   mike myers   spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in  79 and permits him passage   but not before he doffs his hideous shirt   of course    once inside   shane becomes seduced by the club s dizzying vortex of sex and drugs    he has such a good time that he doesn t want to leave   so he seeks employment as a busboy    he quickly becomes friends with greg   breckin meyer   and anita   salma hayek     a married couple who work along side of him   greg s a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender   while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own    after rubbing elbows   among other things   with a renowned socialite   sela ward   and gaining the personal interest of rubell   shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54    but fame doesn t come without a price       54    s major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players   at a slim hour and a half   the film is too short to take on such a multi character focus   and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act    alleged last minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction   since   54   sometimes feels like it s missing a scene here or there    nowhere is this more apparent than in shane s relationship with soap opera actress julie black   neve campbell     a frequent studio 54 patron whom he s long admired from afar    the romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special    that   54   works despite these limitations   then   is largely due to the competence and energy with which it s assembled    sure   it s shallow   slick   sanitized portrait of a bygone age   and sure   we ve seen the rags to riches story gazillions of times   but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision    the film boasts some fine comic creativity   the pinnacle of which is disco dottie     the wedding singer    s ellen dow     an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public   but slides up to shane behind 54 s closed doors and asks for a   funky little treat      the solid   sexy cast smooths out   if only while you re caught up in the film   any rough spots belonging to their alter egos or the plot    newcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat   he and campbell   as fetching as ever   look so good together it s a shame their subplot goes nowhere    meyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in   clueless     he was the stoner with the joker smile     while hayek simply sizzles   especially when leading a dance class with the mantra     one   two   three   attitude !

Pos, i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan    i ve seen some of his films   silkwood   backdraft   unlawful entry   and while he gave adequate performances   i have never been impressed with his work    breakdown   then   is something of a surprise    russell gives a fine performance   as do most of the cast   one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film    to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true   but he does it no harm    russell plays jeff   one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy   kathleen quinlan   cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life    while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and   left helpless and stranded   jeff waves down a passing truck driver   j   t    walsh   who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck    because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians   jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help    that   it seems   is the last time jeff   or anyone else   sees her    breakdown has been compared to several movies   george sluizer s the vanishing   the original   hopefully   not his appalling hollywood remake     steven spielberg s duel and any number of hitchcock films    as with these   breakdown does not   for the most part   stray down the conventional path of the american action thriller    jeff does not become a gun toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife   but instead becomes a scared   confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on    when we do find out what has happened to amy   it does come as a slight disappointment   if only because it s too early in the film   i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment   but this affects the film little    russell   as mentioned earlier   is very good in his role   and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13    j   t    walsh   as the possibly evil truck driver   is terrific   he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn t seem to know what to do with   but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here    the reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person   one anyone would be able to trust   which makes the plot that much more believable    breakdown is what hollywood doesn t make enough of   a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do   indeed   have viewers on the edge of their seats    one of the most genuinely exciting films i ve seen in a long time    
Pos, in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies   payback was better than conspiracy theory   but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon    in other words   it s a decent couple of hours of entertainment   but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson s greatest hits   payback probably won t be on it    gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll    mel s partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt    so he puts a couple of bullets in mel   leaving him for dead   and goes on to pay off his creditors    but   mel isn t dead   it would be a real short movie if he was   and he certainly isn t happy    to make matters worse   he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat    his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters   so mel goes after the mob to get it back    payback is often a very violent film    to its credit   there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic   but the director   i m not sure which one    more about that in a second   made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films    the film appears a bit disjointed in places   which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn t thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re shot    when the director refused   another one was brought in to do the re shoot    so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original   although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake   it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end    it s always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain   unless that person has some redeeming qualities    in this case   gibson s character has few redeeming qualities    but hey   its mel   so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him    my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role   the audience would not be quite as responsive    gibson is gibson   whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer   he does a good job    he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance    this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast   including maria bello   as his love interest     william devane and kris kristofferson   as mod bosses      the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn t have a real big part is james coburn   as yet another mobster      if i had one big disappointment in this film   it would be that coburn didn t have a bigger role    in the end   payback is a fairly solid action thriller   just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson s other work    
Pos, james cmaeron s breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok    for those of you who do not know the plot   in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race    human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed    however   some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor    to stop connor   the machines send a terminator   arnold schwarzenegger   back to 1984 to murder connor s mother   sara   linda hamilton     and thus prevent connor from ever being born    in response   the humans send a protector   kyle reese   played by michael biehn    images of machines and of humans  reliance on machines dominate the film    even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029   humans continue to use the machines    in the climax of star wars   luke relies on the force alone  his own spiritual power  to destroy the death star    in the terminator   however   sara must use another machine  a giant hydraulic press  to vanquish her enemy    cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable  and he s not happy about it    unabated technological growth brings about the terminator s other obsession   the apocalypse    we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon   thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la    children watch the flames in a burning television    when the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him    even though the   future is not set     there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie   the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence    all sara can do is await it       cameron doesn t wimp out like he does in terminator 2    the end of the world is the human race s own fault   too    after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place    back in 1984   when the cold war was still in full effect   the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war   another obsession of cameron s      these days   one can read a criticism of machine like behavior in humans    true   humanizing touches are put into paul winfield s and lance henriksen s detective characters   but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected    cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la    from a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done    arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist  unstoppable   merciless   obdurate    we are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger s later works   eg   commando     but fear him    cameron and hurd s script basically depicts a one hour and forty five minute chase   taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot    while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for   there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese s intentions    cameron directs the film at a rapid   kinetic pace    either the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving  usually both occurs    the violence is not particularly graphic   temple of doom s heart pull scene outgrosses the terminator s     but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective    for a low budget film   the terminator s special effects and art direction   especially in 2029 la   are remarkably well done    special mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton    it is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen    one thing that doesn t hold up after all the years   however   is linda hamilton s hairdo

Pos, screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker    screenplay by andrew kevin walker    inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving    directed by tim burton    starring johnny depp   christina ricci   and casper van dien    special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken    synopsis   investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation    townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them    cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery    comments   tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years    batman   of course   is perhaps his best known film and led to a string of less successful sequels    he s done biographical work   on the director ed wood     children s movies   nightmare before christmas     and a homage to alien invasion movies   mars attacks !      sleepy hollow   his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while   shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies    sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s   especially hammer studios  reworkings of dracula and frankenstein   and american international s series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe    christopher lee   in fact   star of many hammer productions over the years   appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders    the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s    one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein    i mention these allusions for a reason    seasoned horror film fans   including myself   will smile at their inclusion in this film    with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies   especially the blair witch project   the most overblown turkey of the decade     we needed a film like this    not only does it have a sense of history   but burton s skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror    the film s eerie landscapes and foggy towns   indeed   overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie    johnny depp   a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands   plays ichabod crane   who has apparently changed occupations from irving s original story and is now an investigator    depp is adequate in his role    no more   no less    equally adequate is christina ricci   who plays the love interest in the film    she s a good witch too    how cute    one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters    the two actors   however   carry the movie well enough   but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine    veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough   who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks   are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers    while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points   i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing    you have to pay attention    andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay    he s the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven    walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood   and sleepy hollow certainly doesn t hurt his growing reputation    as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker   sleepy hollow is quite graphic    there s a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings    this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to    a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25   30 minutes covering the youngest s eyes with her hand    he was obviously upset by the movie s intense violence    if you re looking for a good scare   however   sleepy hollow is definately recommended    
Neg, sylvester stallone has made some crap films in his lifetime   but this has got to be one of the worst    a totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting     the specialist   is about as exciting as an episode of   dragnet     and about as well acted    even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script   stupid and unlikable characters   and just plain nothingness    who knew a big explosion could be so boring and anti climactic    unless you saw   blown away             the specliast   of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone   in comeback #19   i think     who plays a quiet   hermit like bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something   but who suffered a change of heart when he and his assistant   james woods   who shows us exactly what over the top is   other than another bad sly film   accidentally killed some innocent people during a job    his credo is killing bad people   not innocents    and that s why he makes big bombs    so anyway   into his life steps the seductive sharon stone   who is basically the girlfriend/moll of the stupid son   eric roberts   of a cuban/miami kingpin   rod steiger   in an indecipherable accent   which is sometimes cuban   sometimes brando   sometimes scottish   etc      turns out sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him   since he killed her parents when she was young    so she calls sly   leaves messages with him   sends him e mail   etc   about planting a bomb to kill roberts   which sly listens to obsessively   and while he works out naked    yea    also into his life   though again   comes woods   who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly    using the cops   he tries to set up traps   none which really work   so when sly calls him   he goes ballisitic on his ass over the phone   getting so worked up by saying his must be improvised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open    these are the most exciting scenes in the film   and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film    the film tries to offer us a moody film noir   except with explosions   but comes up completely snake eyes    it s just a pretend film noir   making it a big waste of time    and for action buffs   the action scenes are pretty lame   with some really unrealistic looking special effects   a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a piece of cardboard falling into a tub      then there s the much discussed sex scene between sly and stone   which are about as mispaired a couple as rachel and ross on   friends      their sex scene is more nauseating then sexy   because it shows us more of sly than stone    now let s guess who we d rather see naked   okay    stone s small but perky breasts   which we ve seen more times than harvey keitel s dick   or stallone s veiny ass   which isn t usually shown for a very good reason    i know i can t really judge it as a flaw of the film   but come on    the worst flaw of the film is this   it s boring    i mean   i was on caffeine when watching it   but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting    but a good movie does not james woods going nuts make    if you re in for some fun action   rent sly s earlier   demolition man     which sucks too   but in a much more entertaining fashion    skip this dull film   unless you want to see woods   or make fun of steiger s accent   or see stone s breasts again    
Pos, the film   magnolia   can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests    the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower    they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart    the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially    from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host   each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain    they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness    whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse   each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one       magnolia   is a clever   well thought out film from prodigy director writer paul thomas anderson of   boogie nights   fame    the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make   magnolia   memorable    however   what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories   the film is never confusing    anderson s control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful    he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of   magnolia s   scenes drag on too long    any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending    from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn t get boring    it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot    this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation    every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees    for example   cop john c   reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall s daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly    the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes   races   and genders suffer    anderson s explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing    the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously    this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get    the performances in   magnolia   are perfection    this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting    anderson allows many of hollywood s best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best   character acting    all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film    worth noting is tom cruise   who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance    he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past   however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints   the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon s character as phillip baker hall s wife    she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film       magnolia   uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters    anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours    to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity    diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time    i predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future    
Pos, the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/director/producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director   he really is    he wrote this film   he directed this film   he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film    i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it s popularity or it s ability to scare the wits out of people    i think i have seen  halloween  over 100 times and each time i find something new and brilliant   and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen    i own three different versions of the film   a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary t shirt   a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation   in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow globe    in other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film    it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only 2   4   and 7 being truly good    it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan    since i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of 30   000 copies   i knew i had to buy one no matter what !  i did and man to me it s the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film    no words can describe the dvd    in  halloween  michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood 16 years ago in 1963    now in 1978 grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield   illinois   followed by his past doctor sam loomis    the person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut    why is he stalking her    check out halloween ii it explains it all    on this unholy night on october 31   1978 laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives   which is trying to stay alive    the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk    nick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job   and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did    what john carpenter did in 1978 is made a ground breaking new film   with scares   wit   and style    the movie is flawless if not perfect    no other movie or sequel has lived up to this one   and in my opinion never will     halloween  will be like  psycho  and still be extremely popular even almost 40 years later    i just hope someday  halloween  will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the 4 extra scenes on the dvd edition     halloween  isn t just another slice and dice horror flick   it s an intelligent   horrifying and best film experience ever made    see  halloween  and be scared         then  watch it again !  reviewed by brandon herring october 7   1999    
Pos, the latest epos from lars is a blast   although a rather moody one    this lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 something    the church   calvinistic   is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower   they are considered being too unrestrained    in these surroundings we find the to be weds jan and bess   played by stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson    jan is on leave from the oilrig and bess      is just bess   a bit naive and innocent   in every aspect of the word     at first    at the wedding party we are told an anecdote   illustrating her infinite kindness   she once lend a bike to an stranger   her best friends bike however    but bess is suffering in this scary religious society    we soon take part in a funeral where a man   fallen off the orthodox path   is laid to rest while doomed to hell    women are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up in the church    when the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend   almost manic   that her friends try to calm her down a bit    the time has come when jan is to return to the rig   bess is falling into the darkness of depression   her yelling of grief and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves    she can t stand the thought of life without her husband    we witness her dialogues with god   she speaks both parts   paranoia      convincing god to return jan from the oilrig   and her prayers are heard    an accident on the rig bring him back   paralysed from the neck and down    now he can t satisfy her need for physical love   he try to persuade her into finding a lover   with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in every detail    at first she resist   but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply    imagine what this is doing to the poor girl    the story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby   accompanied by music from the era   procol harum   deep purple   t rex and others    the use of hand held camera and lack of any make up make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre    the incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant   though a bit too gloomy for my taste    i would say that it is in the genre of betty blue   37   2 le matin   and bitter moon   lunes de fiel      emily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances   this must be the reason for giving it the   grand prix du jury   in cannes this year   although we had hoped for the   palme d or        the screenplay is now available in print   the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may to july   just in time for the danish premiere    
Neg, there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director    of course   his best film was 1978 s masterpiece     halloween     but he also made 1980 s   the fog     and 1987 s underrated     prince of darkness      heck   he even made a good film in 1995   with   in the mouth of madness      but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992   with the terrible comedy     memoirs of an invisible man      somehow   carpenter has lost his touch   with junk like his failed 1995 remake of     village of the damned     to his uninspired 1996 sequel     escape from l   a     those movies   however   look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film     john carpenter s vampires      if i was him   i definately wouldn t want to put my own name in the title    it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as     vampires      the story is simple    jack crow   james woods   is a vampire hunter who   along with one of his partners   montoya   daniel baldwin     and a prostitute   katrina   sheryl lee     survives an attack from the master vampire   valek   thomas ian griffith      since katrina was previously bitten by him   crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later   and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her    it seems valek s mission is to steal a black   wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him    my question is   how many time have we seen this same story played out    well   the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made       john carpenter s vampires     sadly enough   is one of the most unscary horror films i ve ever seen    in fact   there isn t even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105 minute running time    the non stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed   without any interesting camera work   which is usually a trademark of carpenter s    and then we come to the screenplay   which   as far as i can tell   is nearly non existent    there is no story development   and there isn t even an attempt to flesh out the characters    james woods can be a good actor   but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of   pseudo    clever lines of dialogue    daniel baldwin has some potential   but his character comes off as being very dense    and sheryl lee   faring much better as laura palmer in   twin peaks       like all of the female characters   plays an offensive stereotypical whore    there is not an ounce of intelligence   or excitement in     john carpenter s vamires     which is very disheartening coming from an ex fan of carpenter s    he has said that he turned down directing     halloween   h20     because he couldn t work up any excitement for it    and yet   when asked about a   vampires   sequel   he said he would be happy to do it    i think that s a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent   not to mention a significant number of iq points    
Neg, wesley snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles    murder at 1600   u   s   marshals   money train   drop zone   boiling point   and the ultimate camp film   passenger 57    the art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category    ultimately   it is little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the warren report   ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe   and terrible acting by b list actors like michael biehn and anne archer    oddly   it feels like the undiscovered sequel to another snipes   masterpiece     rising sun    the movie revolves around the convenient story of a special un operative caught up in a secret murder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador   the chinese triad brotherhood   a rich chinese businessman   played by   that bad guy from rising sun   cary hiroyuki tagawa   a chinese un interpreter   and   inexplicably   donald sutherland    the film ends with more confusion than a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island    or should i say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woo s hong kong films combined    i am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers of the film    i usually enjoy snipes  movies   though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films    simply   i am amazed by the how inane the script was   filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences    director christian duguay   screamers   has a strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts    showing splattering brains   people impaled with broken shards of glass   and lots of gargling and gagging as blood sprays everywhere    it also sickens me to know that oliver stone   one of the greatest directors working today   had his hand in producing this monstrosity    i guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle and stone chose not to read the script   watch the dailies   be involved in casting   or anything else    or else he d be filing a court order to remove his name from the credits    it s also seems evident that with the russkies as our new bosom buddies and the middle eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last couple of years that the new international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese    i m sure over the next couple of months   even more   chinese conspiracy/martial arts action flicks   are going to be popping up in your local multiplex    hopefully they won t include wesley snipes    
Pos, what s shocking about   carlito s way   is how good it is    having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino s previous film     scent of a woman     and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one   he had just won an oscar       carlito s way   was destined for underrated heaven    that s what it is   an underrated gem of a movie    and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it   and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study       carlito s way   deals with   well   carlito brigante   pacino     a puerto rican ex drug kingpin   who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke addicted   curly haired lawyer   sean penn   points out a legal technicality    of course   carlito was actually awoken in prison   and has decided to go straight   even if he s really a crook at heart    carlito   like barry lyndon   is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn   and can t escape into something he is not    carlito s attempts at a clean   legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn    when he first gets out   a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot out   where he has to kill a couple people to survive    he s constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he s doing anything illegal   and his lawyer finds himself neck deep in a pile of shit   needing him to try and help him out   which includes him doing some prison breaking    carlito   like ratso rizzo   wants to go to miami   since   according to film logic   that s where it s at     but needs some funding    being a legend   he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club   this is the 70s   by the way   and since some of this takes place in night clubs   we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics   including several k   c    and the sunshine band tunes   my personal favorite      he gets a bodyguard   the great luis guzman   at his best     and is soon running a pretty good business   even if he s constantly attracting underworld young thugs   like benny blanco   from the bronx     john leguiziamo     who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito    on the other side   the symbol of promise and hope   is gail   penelope ann miller   what happened to her       his girlfriend from before prison    she s a goregeous ballerina   and a stripper   and soon carlito is trying to get back with her   and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami    while this relationship is never fully defined or anything   we get a sense of love between them   and they have some truly interesting scenes between them   she never gives him addresses or locales   he always has to track her down      all of these elements clash together at the end   in a brilliantly executed   emotional climax   which is inevitable    when i say inevitable   i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack   putting a great spin on it    sure   it s going to eleveate some of the tension   but it gives the film a lot of depth   as carlito is seen trapped by fate    what s amazing is the big chase sequence   amazingly done by de palma   has a lot of tension and thrills    like   apollo 13     we know what s going to happen   but we re still thrilled by what happens in the middle    it s also very emotional   thanks to a great script by david koepp   and amazing performances by pacino and miller    de palma is famous   or infamous   for lots of violence in his films    his earlier flim     scarface     which starred pacino in the lead     has a ton of it   especially at the end   and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i m still not over      but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes    to me   the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building   looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet    this is the most brilliantly done   and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film   and probably the best in de palma film history    with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background   and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito s head   and a saddened   remorseful look on pacino s face   it s a tear jerker   well   for me   i dunno about you            the acting from all is great   especially from the three leads    pacino was panned for his performance   chiefly because his accent wasn t puerto rican enough and   well   it wasn t as   strong   as his oscar winning role in   scent of a woman      well   his   scent of a woman   performance was great and all   but it was nothing really but   as comic kevin pollack said   a   foghorn leghorn impression      in   carlito s way     he s emotional   and strong   despite the fact that he s remorseful over his entire lifestyle   which he cannot change    i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango dancing   insult throwing blind guy in   scent of a woman      as i said   penelope ann miller is great   and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry    and they re scenes are well written   with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship    and sean penn is amazing as the coke addicted rat attorney    every scene he s in   he has great energy   and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino    in smaller roles   john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great       carlito s way   is one of those films which you heard about briefly   but when you finally watch it   you re absolutely blown away    it s a wonderful film   a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn t do so hot    but trust me and check it out    it s a great little film   and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right    
Neg, written by alex cox   tod davies   terry gilliam and tony grisoni  directed by terry gilliam  i ve always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid    dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded   you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are   no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat   and no idea how long the ride will last    then there s the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine laced dose    mushrooms   on the other hand   offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel   a steady   reassuring assent   a short period of thrilling motion and color   and then a smooth landing    acid is for daredevils   mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy    my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas   director terry gilliam has made an acid movie   when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie    full of shocking sight gags   aggressive images and grotesque comic performances   the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s   thompson s book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world view from the inside out    but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well made film   gilliam has produced a mixed bag    fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self professed   gonzo   journalist hunter s   thompson   johnny depp   and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta   benicio del toro     came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney s convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971    operating under the pseudonyms of   raoul duke   and   dr    gonzo     the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender   then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite   cocaine   tequila and a rainbow of multi colored uppers and downers    they terrorize every one they meet   mostly because every one they meet terrifies them    duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town   then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge    dr   gonzo becomes enamored of a thick bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane s   white rabbit   reaches its climax    and these guys don t just trash hotel rooms   they rape them   humiliate them and leave them for dead    that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence   depending on your point of view    thompson s book   besides being a hilarious read   has stood the test of time as an important historical document    it simultaneously exposed the 60 s drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die    pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson s message   but the truth is that   stripped to its bare essentials   what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy    it s a cheech and chong movie    you re there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results   see johnny take drugs   see johnny fall down    there s nothing wrong with this concept   but gilliam tries too hard    this is a frantic movie   all sweaty close ups   wide angle lenses   dutch tilts and other worldly lighting schemes    there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen    but to what end    much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson s book   and there are some priceless comic observations    but you re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work    this brings us to the performances   which strike me as all wrong    depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c   scott in patton   a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson s dialogue    in between his several puking scenes   del toro fares better as dr   gonzo   but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost    watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago   with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads   now that would have been something to see    it s interesting to note that alex cox   credited as a co writer on the screenplay   was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over    as much of a fan as i am of gilliam s work   cox would have been the better choice    sid and nancy   cox s best work   covered essentially the same subject matter   but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film    gilliam commits the compound sin of over directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose    what kind of movie was he trying to make   anyway    it doesn t try to be a cautionary tale   and it doesn t work as broad comedy    if he had considered more carefully his purpose   the result would have been a much more interesting film    but i don t want to be too hard on it    there are some truly funny moments   and if you re in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it    i do   however   recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance   i guarantee it will enhance the effect    
Neg,    flubber   is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation   and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney    it s the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids   but anyone else will feel left out as it s boring   slow   and incredibly lifeless    what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water   and it s a shame because it could have been a great film    hypothetically   i mean       flubber     as you probably know   is a remake of the disney classic i never saw     the absent minded professor     where a   well   absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as   flubber     you know   flying rubber    the new one keeps the basic plot   but appears to have added a lot else   like more absent mindedness on the part of the proffessor   some more villains   and several   show stopping   moments   like a big rumba with the flubber   and some more elaborate setups   none which really make it any better   but instead make it worse    the basic plot revolves around a college professor   philip brainerd   robin williams     who creates lots and lots of inventions   but is sadly absent minded    in fact   he s forgotten his wedding to the college s president   sara jean reynolds   indie actress marcia gay harden     two times before he forgets it again at the beginning    doesn t this warrant some kind of mental treatment    anyway   on his wedding day   the third one     he invents the flubber   which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed   but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in   the abyss      philip believes that this invention   once fully realized   will save his college   which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon/villain   chester hoenicker   raymond j   barry     which is ironically enough the same college his brat son   will wheaton   thought he was dead   goes to    through a plot twist   hoenicker s goons   named smith and wesson   ha ha   what a great sense of humor this film has   who are played by clancy brown and ted levine   both who needed the pay check     discover it the hard way   and try to steal for hoenicker   who wants it just  cause he s evil enough    a sub plot involves philip s attempts to win back sara   who s angry at him   and with good reason     but who is being seduced by who is basically philip s belloq   wilson croft   christopher mcdonald   playing the hysterically suave yet unsuave asswhole once again      and in another subplot   philip s day timer robot   weebo   voiced by the one and only jodi benson     falls in love with him    yuckity yuck    what s most pathetic about this film is how dull it is    you don t need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film   which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney   who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry   half assedly re mixing classics   or non classics   for distribution to the general public   who sadly eats it all up    earlier in  97   they released   jungle 2 jungle     an adaptation of a really awful french film     un indien dans la ville     which   yeah   improved over the original   but not by much    disney s in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now   only creatively    in the rush to ship out a film for distribution   disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called   magic      such scenes as dancing flubber   a flying car   a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber   and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze   delight   or even cause people to laugh    i sat there the entire film stone faced   chuckling perhaps twice   and shaking my head at all the bad jokes    who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry    didn t think so    it doesn t help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable    philip is not a lovable absent minded professory   just a really dumb man being played by robin williams    williams is a brilliant comic actor       okay   a brilliant actor in general   but here he s given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something   and other times act sad    those times   he s not bad    but what are we supposed to think of a man who s forgotten his wedding thrice    maybe it was funny and/or respectable in the 60s        i like disney   and i usually enjoy their films   not only animated but live action   and their recent films   save for   hercules     which was good   but not great   have been worse than lackluster   they ve been pathetic       jungle 2 jungle   is probably the worst film i saw last year       flubber    s probably second    what do they need to do    perhaps create something new    get writers who can write something that s universally entertaining    films like   the parent trap   and   mary poppins   are films that are live action   or in the latter case a mix of both     but even i can still watch them because they re not only written to be magical to children   but to be fun to adults    what s more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn    and my god   couldn t they have done something else with edie mcclurg    
Pos, although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama  the sopranos     analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it s own right    billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol   who new  patient  happens to be gangster boss paul vitti   de niro      ben wants nothing to do with vitti   as he s about to get married to laura macnamara   kudrow   and having a gangster as a patient wouldn t really help    but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds   and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out    all done in a comic fashion   of course    although never brilliant   analyze this is also never rubbish   which makes for a fun ride    billy crystal   who hasn t had a good role since city slickers way back in the early  90 s   is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act    he s pretty funny while he does it   and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers   he s pretty funny    robert de niro is hilarious as vitti   playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny    he s a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine    lisa kudrow   barely seen as crystals  estranged wife to be   basically reprises her phoebe role from t   v series friends   which is getting rather tiresome   and doesn t come off well on the screen    the supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas   and are all funny caricatures   especially vitti s bodyguard jelly   joe viterelli      the film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie   but with laughs instead of hard ass talking    it sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film   but it strangely fits in    spoofs are made of famous gangster movies   including a nice parody of the godfather    the italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun    there s also some odd plot points   fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason    it is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history   and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script    unfortunately   this is hollywood   so we will never know    harold ramis   best known as egon from ghostbusters   has a deft touch with directing comedy   as shown in the immortal groundhog day   and the less immortal caddyshack    all the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience    the script   written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan   starts off funny   remains funny for the most of the film   but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory    the film is short   however   and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll    analyze this is a good comedy   and is certainly worth watching    robert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it   even though it does seem forced   or like a parody   although i think this was intentional      crystal is his most likeable in years   kudrow is given as little screen time as possible   which is a good thing   and de niro is just awesome    it s no goodfellas   and it probably won t be remembered as much as groundhog day   but analyze this is a well done comedy that won t leave you feel cheated    
Neg, back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention   new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big screen update of the cult 1960s sci fi tv show lost in space   complete with in person appearances by cast members mimi rogers   matt leblanc   lacey chabert   jack johnson   and even gary oldman    that should have set off my warning alarms  the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago   when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in person cameo to peddle        last action hero    but no   like millions of others   i bought into the hype and   got lost      if only i had gotten lost  literally  on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped together blockbuster wannabe    you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film    at the convention   goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series   and if that really is the case   i d hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in    to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with  which there most certainly is not    after the setup   in which the robinson family  father john   william hurt   looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews     mother maureen   rogers   wasted     daughters judy   heather graham   ditto   and penny   a heavily made up chabert   looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things     and son will   young newcomer johnson   making the best of it     and pilot don west   leblanc   doing a bad han solo impression   find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr   smith   a watered down but still lively oldman   cashing a paycheck and loving every minute     the script s   stream   of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along  and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting    they encounter another ship    they board it    alien spiders attack them    they return to their ship    the other one explodes    they land on a deserted planet    and so on    an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act   but goldsman doesn t seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device   when one character s past self dies   the future incarnation inexplicably lives on    the look and effects should be lost in space s ace in the hole   but hopkins even manages to botch that    for a big budget film   the visual effects are incredibly shoddy    in one composite background shot   i could see the blue outline around oldman   the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like        digital effects    but nothing in those shots is as jaw droppingly unconvincing as blawp   a monkey like space creature that becomes penny s pet    entirely computer generated and every inch showing it   blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game    apparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it   how else can one explain the graininess of blawp s composite shots with the human actors    but in doing so   the seams are that much more obvious    you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystal clear solo reaction shot of judy    new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long running star trek cash cow at paramount    i don t think so    in a few years   the lost in space movie will likely live on not as a series but as the obscure answer to a trivia question   what film ended titanic s 15 week reign at the top of the weekend box office    
Neg, coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers   relentless   1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz   played by character actor leo rossi   spawned three more sequels    relentless 3   third in the row   features sam dietz again   but this time detective   who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case   doesn t want to deal with similar line of work    divorced   demoralised and transferred   he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer   and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz s old cases    to make things even more interesting   it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation    fans of the british tv films and mini series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies    they both feature vicious psychopathic killers   yet also give a lot of   usually depressive   details about chief investigator s private lives    this one isn t an exception   but similarities with british television are only in content    the execution and style is different   which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best    useless   gratuitous erotica also doesn t help either   obviously making this film longer than it should be    the actors are good   though   leo rossi is fine as usual   and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career    signy coleman as dietz s love interest   is   on the other hand   quite miscast    but she won t have to worry about it in the future career   since relentless 3 wasn t supposed to be anybody s finest moment anyway    
Neg, david spade has a snide   sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me    it also served as a good showcase for him when he co starred   opposite the late chris farley   in tommy boy and black sheep    lost and found marks the comedian s first attempt at going solo in a movie   and it also reveals that when spade doesn t have a reliable back up system   his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect    david spade is not the problem with lost and found    he plays dylan ramsey   the sweet main character   to the best of his abilities    the story revolves around dylan s obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour   lila dubois   sophie marceau   from braveheart     and her terrier named jack    dylan believes that the best way to a woman s heart is through her dog    and so he kidnaps jack   planning to stage a fake rescue   in hope to win lila over    there are three good things about lost and found    the first is spade    the second is sophie marceau   a lovely actress who s been planted into the wrong movie    lastly   there s the dog   who is used here in a similar context to puffy from there s something about mary    unfortunately   director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute    this kind of physical humor is dead    pollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with a baseball bat to get laughs   and this procedure is cheap   unfunny and resoundingly cruel    this is where i start to get fuzzy    also in this unusual blend is   apparently   a sweet natured love story between dylan and lila    given the mean spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for   i found this hard to swallow    and   why does dylan even deserve someone like lila   after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain    predictably   lost and found opts for a happy ending   one that feels so sentimental   gooey   and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makes you feel a bit cheated    david spade   who also co wrote the movie   tries hard   so very hard   to make this project amusing    there are some choice scenes that are quite funny   but the movie is only sporadically funny    patrick bruel plays the stock character of rene   the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over   with his good looks and money    jon lovitz and martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles    despite a few positive attributes   lost and found just doesn t work    if you re searching for an enjoyable romantic comedy   you could do far better than this obvious   misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard for what it s trying to present    
Pos, ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan    you remember   he was the title character in that 70 s sitcom     welcome back kotter      always trying to help out the sweathogs   frequently trying to dodge mr   woodman   ever wary of his wife s tuna casserole       so     you ask     where is he now      mr   kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high stakes poker    that s right    i m not sure if it s his main source of income   but from what i ve heard   the guy occasionally comes away with $20   000 at a time    and there you were   thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off broadway theater    you silly goose    well   gabe kaplan isn t in the movie rounders   nor is the film about the actor come gambler s life    but rounders is about poker   and gabe plays poker   and i thought that was kind of a neat connection    sorry about the segue   or lack thereof    matt damon plays mike mcdermott   a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker    he s been playing for a while   and more than being proficient   he has caught the bug    he goes to all the underground games in new york city   knows the regulars   and knows how to win    in the beginning of the film   he s built up a nice thirty grand nest egg   which he takes to the speakeasy type gaming parlor where the big boys play    mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb   john malkovich     an oreo munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia    mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker   but instead he loses it all in a single hand    months later   he s paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck    when mike s best friend and poker buddy worm   edward norton   finishes his jail term for hustling some students   he wants to pick up right were they left off   working as a team to part others with their betting cash    although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student   jo   gretchen mol     worm connives mike into playing once more   and mike   bitten again by the bug   slides down that slippery slope   risking his relationship   education   and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life    to make a film about gambling   a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters    this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth    rounders   however   seems to go more for the latter than the former    the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren t very glamorous at all    there s a basement   a lodge with elk heads on the wall   a goulash joint   these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots    except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city   the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table    the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it    we re given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations   and good actors to play them    matt damon is very natural as mike   who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school   and answering what may be his true calling   playing professional poker    ed norton s worm is truly a worm   always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they re worth    john turturro   who amazes me with his acting range   tones it down in this film by playing joey knish   a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments    he s both a friend and mentor to mike   and turturro s low key performance is totally convincing   just as john malkovich s heavily accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself    martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike s law professors   abe petrovsky    while landau slips well into the role   his character   spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one s self   facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending    perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line up of acting talent   however   is gretchen mol who just didn t seem to have much presence on screen    she s a genuine peach to look at   kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel   and i wouldn t be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world     but her delivered lines seemed very flat   and i found myself looking for matt damon s reactions instead    a good thing about rounders is that it doesn t get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can t find time for humor    the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going   such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next   in widely different locales    one game in a cigar club had me in stitches       i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper     says one of the players   clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other    i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys    with all the poker being played   rounders had the potential to be very confusing    you might think you know a lot about poker   but think again    luckily   we re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what s going on    the narrations are more informative than intrusive   and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do    it s nice that as the characters develop   so does our comprehension of their world    as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker   rounders delivers in spades    wait !  as a film about the culture of cards   rounders is an ace    hang on !  packed with great acting and great characters   rounders is a full house    okay   i guess that s enough    oh   by the way   if you ever want to get into a game with ol  gabe kaplan   be sure to bring a note from epstein s mother    
Pos, i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater   on a sunday afternoon    when the movie was over and the audience was exiting   i didn t hear one negative comment   and i didn t have any to offer    simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys   simon   ian michael smith   and joe   joseph mazzello     and what destiny holds for both of them    simon is a dwarf   who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart    surprisingly   he does   and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle    simon thinks god has a plan for him   a purpose for his life   and his condition   he just doesn t know what    joe is an illegitimate child   referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard     who s mom   ashley judd   won t tell him who his father is    simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem   the people in the town don t really like him   because he isn t   natural      even his own parents don t care about him   and are disappointed they didn t have a   normal   son    he is also harassed in church by the local pastor   rev   russell   david strathairn   and simon s chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks    the only person   other than joe   that really cares for simon is joe s mom   who he also looks up to as a mother    it would be just simon s luck   that he would accidentally kills joe s mom   something you are told at the beginning of the movie    joe   now motherless as well as fatherless   feels the need to find out who his real father is    with the help of ben   oliver platt     the local drama teacher and joe s mom s current boyfriend   before her death     he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way    most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny   although not all of it is    simon will also look for god s plan for him   although he loses a little faith along the way    starring in the first   and last   five minutes of the film is hollywood s newest dramatic actor   jim carrey    jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off   and then tying it up just right    this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway   and he does a commendable job    simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson   this is his first film as director   but he has written several films   including the grumpy old men series    he does an outstanding writing and directing job here   the film s structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly    the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat    the cast is excellent    joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance    joseph is outstanding for someone of any age   not alone someone who just turned 15    ian michael smith   in his film debut   has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation    other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast    i loved this movie   it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year    take your whole family to see simon birch   it is a magnificent film  an american masterpiece    
Pos, i ve always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable   death and taxes    oddly   i ve never given much thought to either of the two    maybe if i did   at least i d stop getting collection notices from uncle sam    yes   let me make a resolution to devote myself to better record keeping   hold on to all my receipts   and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are mistake free and will keep me from incurring penalties    it seems that the issue of death may not be so different   at least envisioned here in this film    as this tender love story goes   if you do good things and have a clear conscience when you die   you ascend to a place of great peace and beauty    the dreams   wishes   and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true    for those who die with a burdened soul   however   they wind up in that other place    chris and annie   a winsome robin williams and a radiant annabella sciorra   seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has to offer    their love for each other is strong and their bond is undeniable    but tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of annie s happiness    and when chris dies after a terrible car accident   she commits suicide   a tortured soul who blames herself    despair is perhaps the greatest sin   and she will wallow in her guilt throughout eternity    chris   on the other hand   has made it to heaven   and upon learning of annie s fate   he journeys to hell to find her and to try to free her from her nightmare    this film brims with imagination   containing a lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that is hell    it seems that heaven and hell could very well be a product of our fantasies or nightmares    it s shape and look is as infinite as our imagination    as chris explores his new fantastic world and discovers things both amazing and wondrous   he also begins to learn more about himself    certain questions baffle him at first    why does his home in heaven ooze with paint    what is the significance of the asian stewardess    why does he have an all too willing guide   cuba gooding   jr     to help him find annie    but as he slowly begins to realize the answers   it makes him stronger and gives him a greater chance to save annie       dreams   is both visually and tellingly beautiful    alas   i have one regret    the movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed   but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying    it seemed as if it was racing to some kind of great finish   but its intensity seemed to wane in its final moments    however   your eyes will still well up with tears and you ll find lots to savor    the storytelling is purposeful and well constructed    the journey is imaginative    and i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film

Pos, in these days of overlong movies   meet joe black   the thin red line   the mask of zorro   it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can t be longer than a paltry 90 minutes    this is just a cute movie   even through its mildly risque subject matter    old friends jackie   bannen   and michael   kelley   try to find the lottery winner   they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60   so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings    through process of elimination   they find that it must be lovable old ned devine   who they find sitting in front of his tv   clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand    what results is thuroughly amusing   as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong   and that they could really benefit    after all   old ned won t miss it    rather than divulge the later twists and turns   i ll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage    bannen and kelly are a perfect pair    one slightly stout   the other as thin as a rail    both getting on in years   they make such a cute pair of old codgers    waking ned devine may even be seen as a   full monty   for the geriatric set   especially since kelly gets buff o for one amusing scene    waking ned devine is by no means perfect   but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films    the performances by everyone in the town are great   particularly the two leads    there is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary   but it hardly ruins the picture    writer/director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters    scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm   not the exception    perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more    had i held off on my year s best/worst list for another day   waking ned devine   officially released in late november of 98   surely would have graced the short group of the year s finest films    it is light   but thought provoking and sweet    i can t think of anyone who shouldn t see   or wouldn t enjoy   this film    
Pos, is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all time    it s quite possible    his career spanned over 40 years   and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could    yet   when he is talked about in the media   he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role   the nice guy    and that s really a shame       the naked spur   features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect from him    it s a western   which stewart specialized in around this period   and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to be his friend    before he finds that man   though   he runs into two men who agree to help him   thinking he is a sheriff    when the criminal is eventually caught   the two men discover stewart s secret   and decide they want a piece of the action too    the rest of the film is a suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly    also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal   well played by janet leigh    we re never too sure who s side she s really on until the end    leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the   shower lady   from   psycho     and that s unfair    she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men    stewart gives a performance unlike anything i ve ever seen from him    he usually keeps cool no matter what occurs   but here   he gets downright hysterical at times    i think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just a   nice guy      his performance borders on psychotic at times   but i loved watching every second of it    it s roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i do    he was an actor unafraid to take chances   and even ruin his public image    
Neg, one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles    he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish   and one of his best was his last film   lone star    after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us mexico border   expectation ran high for his next film    unfortunately   his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for    we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do    then the film does exactly what it promised   a painful as that is    the plot of men with guns can be summarized   in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas    dr   fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went    and he found out again and again and again      of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell    a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians    but the film talks down to the viewer    dr   fuentes   played by federico luppi   teaches medicine in the capital city of his country    he has   as a great humanitarian gesture   trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios    fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service    then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy    in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others    the student tells him the others are still in the mountains   but suggests that it may not be a good place to be    fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors   ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general    the results are little different than one would expect    dr   fuentes starts out incredibly naive    even some american tourists   present in the film mostly for comic relief   seem to know better than dr   fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains    but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was    sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians    the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences    federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos    damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter    mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer    
Pos, plot   odin is a great high school basketball player    he s dating a hot girl and the coach loves his ass    in fact   the coach even admits to having fatherly feelings towards him    unfortunately   the coach s real son   hugo   isn t too pleased to hear that    in fact   he doesn t like hearing about any of odin s triumphs   as they generally supersede his own    so what does he set out to do    well   let s just say that he starts to mess with people s heads and one thing leads to another thing which leads to       well    you ll see    critique   a very powerful   thoroughly depressing   well acted   non teen   movie starring a bunch of teens    credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version of this shakespearian classic   set in a realistic high school environment   with the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending sense of doom as it core    you also have to give it up to all of the actors in this film   who turn over some very convincing performances   taking you through all of their characters  ups and downs    hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a despicable character   a dude who you just want to grab by the throat and beat the shit out of   sign of a good actor   if you ask me      phifer also comes to play in this movie   with a nice blend of charisma   fear   love and anger spread over his character    i was always on this guy s side and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along    julia stiles was also good   but her character wasn t much different from others that she s played recently    i was however very surprised with martin sheen s showing   since i hadn t taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few years    his character is definitely over the top in this film   but i appreciated his fervor   his rage   his ultimate and blind desire to win above all    a great example of a workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest    i did have a few reservations about the movie though    first of all   what was with all of the gangsta hip hop music used in pretty much every other scene transition    it was cute at first   but became a little too obvious and annoying after a few times    the film was also edited pretty choppily       like  some scenes were cut out and no one   cleaned it up   afterwards    i also didn t like the fact that hartnett s character   the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down in this film   was infallible    in other words   pretty much everything he says or asks of someone   happens automatically and without any goofups    i mean   i know the guy is smart and all   but i would have appreciated a little more   realism   under some of the circumstances    but overall   the movie will devastate you    it s not a   fun date movie      it s not a movie about the high school basketball team and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the tracks    it s about jealousy   love   envy   fury   passion   revenge and pretty much any other negative thought that s ever passed through your head    is it worth seeing    oh   most definitely !     pun intended   it s a moving picture with great performances   no shakespearian speak   thank you   god !   and an outstanding directorial job by nelson    the final scene alone is enough to send a massive chill down your spine   and i was especially impressed with the director s choice of music near the end    in fact   the whole sequence was quite reminiscent of the final showdown scene from taxi driver   and i guess that s saying something right there    where s joblo coming from    10 things i hate about you   7/10     election   7/10     hamlet   6/10     love s labor s lost   8/10     natural born killers   9/10     save the last dance   7/10     shakespeare in love   5/10    
Pos, seen may 19   1999 at 5 p   m   at the crossgates cinema 18   guilderland   n   y       theater #1   with my brother john for $8   50    [theater rating   * * * *   excellent seats   sound and picture]     critic s note   this review is the longest i ve ever written and still only scratches the surface    i d recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis      as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace    how do i even write this review    never mind the fact that i ve been waiting for a new `star wars  movie since i was seven years old    never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released    never mind that there s so much going on in this movie in terms of plot   action   special effects and long term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn t cover everything    and also like ted does in all of his reviews   i ll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you   the reader    before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film   many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered   to get the specifics of the film   skip this and the next four paragraphs      as has been made obvious for the last several years   another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars  series   the first of the films was actually episode four   not one      george lucas   the creator of the series   has probably just assumed most people know the first produced trilogy   `star wars     `the empire strikes back  and `return of the jedi    is actually the second trilogy   chronologically    in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order   but i can t recall his reasons    with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy   err        second trilogy        well you know what i mean      and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which   unfortunately   may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution    [critic s note #1   it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed   but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule    critic s note #2   reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics  law of reviewing movies   which as roger ebert coined   `it s not what a movie is about   but how it is about it      because so many outside factors come into play in the film s plot and significance as part of a trilogy   and just considering modern society   it again would be difficult   if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story   ]  first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it    we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker   who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire    we know obi wan `ben  kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force  in attempts to become a jedi knight   but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side      we also know something about `the force  itself   that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it   the jedi      what we don t know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy   which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth    to me   this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle   definite order to all the complexity    also   it seems that we re supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended    most notably   details regarding the emperor from `empire  and `jedi     and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine    for those who haven t kept up with all the `star wars  paraphernalia over the years   there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor   or his voice at least      with `the phantom menace  being the first chapter of a long saga   one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid   including the history behind all the major factors of the series   especially `the force  and the jedi knights    unfortunately   this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained    i didn t liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness    if you re going to tell a story from the beginning   tell it from the beginning   is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes  1 through  3 to clarify the back story even further        but i digress    i ve said so much and yet i haven t even touched on the specifics of the film itself    all these necessary `disclaiming  elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars  series is and this individual film itself    what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we ve come to know and love since the late 1970s    its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar   but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality    the basic story is rather sorted   complex and even confusing at times    we re told that an army known as `the trade federation  has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo    we re not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is   instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly    we re introduced to two jedi   the master qui gon jinn   neeson   and his apprentice obi wan kenobi   mcgregor      the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet s queen   amidala   portman      the leader of the federation   an alien called viceroy   is following the orders of a strange   mythical character   an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears    he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance   and especially that creepy evil voice of his   he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series    sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person    clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity   which is never openly revealed in the film   but should be clear to most viewers    i have a feeling we ll delve into his background in the next two films      but it doesn t take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film s story begins to move along    the film doesn t have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini plot and adventure on top of another    there are so many of these mini plots within plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook    the other films have relied on this type of storytelling   but because of the limits of the technology at the time   the films  screenplays were also limiting    the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace  its unique traits    as we already know   the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars  trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story    and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10 year old anakin skywalker   lloyd     by qui gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council    to briefly summarize the story   jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala s spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation    their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force    jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force   and through another sub plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter   more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves    this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before    in fact   it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before    the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary    by the film s third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot    it s funny how the reality of the `star wars  world seems so embedded in mythology   new age like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence    not that this technique hasn t been used in movies and in real life situations countless times throughout history    and at least it s all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter    it does border of the cartoonish sometimes   but that s just the film appealing to our inner child   which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society    `the phantom menace  delivers exactly what you d expect from a `star wars  film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness    so many things in the film we ve seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited    but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies    
Neg, starring william baldwin   cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right   the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role    not that cindy does that bad   it s just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy s extraordinary acting skills   but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation    and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty   but i m sure that that is just a coincidence   no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet   well   that s just a happy coincidence    sure    william baldwin isn t a bad actor    unfortunately   he just doesn t demonstrate it at all in this movie    i m not sure if that s because most of his lines were just so hokey   or if he was trying to make cindy s acting look good    if it was the latter   it worked    cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie    which is not to say that she doesn t have room for improvement    although to be fair to cindy   her lines were kinda cheesy in places    so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford   arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet   chose for her foray into the world of cinema    well   i m glad you asked that question    cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents    why woud they target someone as likable as cindy   you ask    by the end of the movie you won t care    the story is so contrived it isn t funny    anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house   without getting so much as a scratch i might add   she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin    who s character   max kilpatric   a police detective   seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine   my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal s early films      the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin s characters of the run from these killer russians isn t all that bad of an idea   it s just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud    the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes    if i was baldwin   i d hope this film disappears    as for crawford   she may indeed have some acting ability    unfortunately   any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad    this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind   since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks    it s too bad they hadn t spent more time on a half decent plot   since ms   crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much    unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you    
Pos, susan granger s review of   hearts in atlantis     castle rock/warner bros      timing is everything   and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the coming of age nostalgia of   stand by me   with the mystical power of   the green mile      based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks   it s set in 1960 in harwich   connecticut   where fatherless 11 year old bobby garfield   anton yelchin   lives in a boarding house with his resentful   self centered mother   hope davis      he s devoted to his neighborhood friends   mika boorem   will rothhaar   but his pivotal relationship is with a strange   new tenant   ted brautigan   anthony hopkins   who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him   instead   a library card    knowing he s longing for a schwinn bike   ted offers to pay him $1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent   ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers    the story structure consists of one long flashback   framed by the present   featuring the adult bobby   david morse     minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins  mysterious character is genteel   sensitive and benignly seductive    the only explanation is that he s a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate   given the inexplicable state of the world right now    the production values and performances are solid   particularly hopkins   arguably the finest   most versatile actor of our era   and the children with whom he forges a firm bond    on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10     hearts in atlantis   is a wistful   enigmatic 8   evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis    
Neg, synopsis   a humorless police officer s life changes when he befriends a super smart   super adorable golden retriever named einstein and a cute   young blond scientist    unfortunately   einstein shares a psychic link with a bigfoot sized ape creature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine   and this rogaine nightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl    meanwhile   a group of white   chain smoking   gun toting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie    comments   watchers reborn   a cheaply made direct to video turkey   is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz s bestselling novel watchers    technically   this should have been called watchers v   but it seems that this cycle of horror movies   much like many other sequel crazy film series   has decided to drop the numbers from the titles       even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi      the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago    this really isn t a good movie    have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation    well   any hope a viewer may have had   perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill   will be dashed by the time he s seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn    they re awful    these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer   some weird crap about a dead indian   teens   and wolves   and an   action   movie called detonator starring scott baio    scott baio !  what idiot dreamed this movie up    after surviving these abysmal trailers   the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented   watchers reborn       maybe it won t be * that * bad   he may say to himself       perhaps   just perhaps   the bottom of the barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading    watchers reborn   after all   is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago    it stars mark hamill    luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy    lou rawls is even in the mix !    unfortunately   the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill   he looks very sick here     and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers   the book    the latter is really too bad    koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good   but he is still my favorite hack writer    koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful    people who read many of his books   however   often complain of repetitive plot devices    it s definately not a koontz book if there isn t   1   a psychic     2   a super intelligent dog   or   3   a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people s eyeballs    watchers has all three devices   which may explain why it s arguably the most popular of koontz s books    the idea behind koontz s novel   though highly implausible   is very interesting    basically   a biological war machine is created   a smart dog can be released in battle   track down its target   and then relay the target s position   psychically   to a large creature designed to kill in hand to hand combat    silly but kind of neat too    i m sorry    i don t mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn   the movie    i suppose i just don t want to talk about the movie itself    this turkey is really cheesy    no one in this movie can act   including mark hamill   and it s difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero    the cheese factor is only increased when he s involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever the f * * k she s supposed to be whom he befriends    mercifully   the filmmakers opted not to do nudity    to be honest   the only half convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein    you know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts    i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie    and the creature !  yes   the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling    this creature is shot about 500   000 times   but it s okay    the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing    oh   he can also rip body parts off   allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around    cheesy gore    that s another main element of watchers reborn    it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film s campiness rather than its suspense    ultimately   i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film s silliness   though this film will tax even their patience    it s an 83 minute film   but it feels like four hours      also   i hate to admit   i have survived far worse than this    anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin   fear the rush will know what i mean    finally   i couldn t help but think that watchers reborn would work well as   bot fodder   for the creative folks behind one of my all time favorite shows     mystery science theater 3000      this thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face    rated r   watchers reborn contains dozens of blood spattered bodies and unconvincing gore    it also has violence   obviously    i wouldn t recommend it for the little kids   but i m sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay    instead of watching this film   however   i recommend reading koontz s book    trust me   it ll be time much   much better spent    
Neg, whenever u   s   government starts meddling into other countries  affairs   under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political   religious or ethnic persecution   the other side is ready to use mantra that says   look who s talking !  what have you done to the indians      however   even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes    hollywood is just another example   with its revisionist westerns   made in early 1990s    those movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness   coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus  discovery of america    one of such examples is geronimo   an american legend   1993 western directed by walter hill   film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers    the hero of the film is geronimo   played by wes studi     leader of apaches   fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century    when the movie begins   in 1885   geronimo and his apaches made peace with u   s   government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation    however   broken promises   injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless    with not more 30 or so of his followers   he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign    general crook   gene hackman     commander of u   s   army forces   respects geronimo and knows that even his 5   000 force isn t enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest    instead   he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches   lt   charles gatewood   jason patric   and indian hunter al sieber   robert duvall      together with young lt   britton davis   matt damon   they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo    geronimo   an american legend   like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness   try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities   but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors    so   the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies    almost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people    although such elements of john millius  screenplay do indeed have some basis in history   they harm the story of geronimo    to be honest   walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film   but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time    instead   they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band    to make even worse   hill has some real problems with pacing and style   and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one   story about geronimo and story about his pursuers    the movie should have been better if it turned to geronimo s life before and after his last uprising   in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood    the difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting    wes studi   cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans   was perfect choice for geronimo   not only because he resembles geronimo   but because he induces a lot of passion in his role    contrary to him   we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies    while this could be expected from someone like jason patric   it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall    even hill s directing is bellow expectations   battle scenes are too short and   like in many of his late films   force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s    even his old associate   music composer ry cooder   disappoints   with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic    on the other hand   photography by lloyd ahern ii   with the use of red lenses   gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere   ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic    all in all   compared with some of the hollywood s examples of political correctness   this film isn t so bad   but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better    
Neg, after enduring mariah carey s film debut   glitter   i m reminded of a bit from chris rock s bigger and blacker    in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man   rock says     you can drive a car with your feet   but that don t mean it should be done      to that i say   you can give mariah carey a movie   but that certainly don t mean it should be done    sure   there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there    from the beatles  a hard day s night to the spice girls  spice world    but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter    everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous    start off with the story   which    as gruesomely predictable as it is    is the least offensive part of the movie    the film is inexplicably set in the 80s   a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers    worse yet   everyone s speaking late 90s hip hop slang in what should be 1983    meant to be partially autobiographical   carey plays billie frank   a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother    influential club dj julian dice   a   k   a     lucky 7     max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro     hears her sing on a track   and decides to make her a star    in predictably rapid succession   billie and dice fall for each other   she starts hitting it big   dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass   and suddenly billie s on   the roller coaster of superstardom      in the meantime   billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom    i won t give away the ending   but    honestly    just think of unicorns and rainbows        you ll figure it out    the movie screams to be made with camp   and that could ve been fun    but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better    what a mistake    the brief attempts at comic relief    as in a scene where an effeminate russian sounding director gets wacky with filming billie s first music video    go over like lead balloons    instead   the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah s most dramatic scenes    which brings us to the performances   of which there s nothing good that can be said    mariah is primarily seen with a wide eyed deer in the headlights look frozen on her face    she actually looks scared during her one love scene    but you have to wonder if the writing isn t even worse    so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey s virginal target audience that it s probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb    even the characters couldn t have been written more absurdly    they re all members of a barbie playset   the important film director who swoons     billie   i d love to put you in a movie i m making     and the big time record executive who takes billie s demo tape and says     oh   i ll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning      everyone in the film is a device   and it s painful to keep watching just to see another one appear    to say more would be a waste    there s so much wrong with this film    and   it pains me that mariah carey    with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days   as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays    will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she s likely to get    but   then again   i had to suffer through her movie    
Pos, i ll be the first to admit i didn t expect much from the emperor s new groove   more celine dion esque song and dance numbers   cuddly characters that become cross promotion devices in mcdonald s happy meals   and hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice over job to their resume    i was dead wrong about all of those things    the emperor s new groove is funny    damn funny    and the cute characters in the film are the dangerous ones    the script is fast and furious   with no singing and dancing    the animation is clean and would give walt a warm feeling all over    the humor is dry and aimed at both the cynicism and the goodness in all of us    the story is ridiculously weird and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking   cross dressing llamas and schizophrenia    here s the plot   try to follow along    set in a mythical kingdom   the film follows the adventures of kuzco   david spade     an arrogant and egocentric emperor    when kuzco fires his power hungry advisor   yzma   eartha kitt     she and her   assistant   kronk   seinfeld s patrick warburton   change him into a llama    kuzco then gets stranded in the jungle and must rely on pacha   john goodman     a llama herder whose home was to be replaced by kuzco s water world theme park   to save him    then the fun starts    for the next sixty minutes   the audience is treated to something unheard of in disney films these days   imagination    yzma   voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt   looks like a cross between norma desmond   joan crawford   and a really old vegas showgirl    the dialogue between her and her oblivious assistant kronk is quick   sharp   and feels like an episode of seinfeld   which would make sense      david spade and john goodman s character interactions make you feel like you re watching an old hope/crosby film    spade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots below the belt on several occasions   and i laughed out loud several times    needless to say   that is an extremely rare thing in disney screenings these days    the best part about the emperor s new groove is how audacious the film is    the sheer weirdness factor is very high    cross dressing   schizophrenia   duality of soul   people being turned into every animal on noah s boat   llama cpr   homoerotic tendencies   an emperor with his own theme song and singer   michael jackson dance moves   and a guy that can communicate with a squirrel are only a few of the oddities that make the film a true orginal    simply put   the emperor s new groove is one of the best children s films out for this holiday season    kids will enjoy the adventures   and parents will enjoy the story and dialogue    that s a tough thing to pull off in a single package   but this emperor manages to do it    
Pos, i was pleasantly surprised by this film    with a budget topping $200 million   i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century s greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see    how much could you dress up the sets    how many models and computer effects could you use    how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks    oh   if i ve just given away part of the plot for you   go back to school    after having viewed titanic   however   i found it to be a well paced   well designed   and overall well made movie    there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic   but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i ve seen    titanic tells its story in two time periods    it starts out in the present   when ocean explorer brock lovett   bill paxton   and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic   searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship    what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace   which is broadcast on the news    the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett   who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas    there she tells her story to lovett and his team    in 1912   rose dewitt bukater   kate winslett     a young lady belonging to society s upper class   boards the titanic for the ship s first atlantic crossing   from southampton   england to new york    she is engaged to cal hockley   billy zane     an heir to old money   and a snob in every sense of the word    on board   rose feels the stifling trappings of high society s expectations   and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic s stern   but is saved from her self proclaimed fate by jack dawson   leonardo dicaprio     a passenger in third class     steerage     as it s referred to     who talks her out of jumping    although for rose the attraction is not immediate   a love affair soon develops between the two   which endangers rose s social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal    the story sounds very simple   and perhaps even unexciting   but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron   a good movie comes through    dicaprio is marvelous as the young   but worldly wise jack   playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors    his is a character that is immediately likable   as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations    girls are going to swoon over him    winslet also proves herself a good actress   delivering her lines convincingly   and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable    the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character s upbringing    simply by judgment of her gait   i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper crust debutante    rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess   she sometimes looks positively clumsy   and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting    billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal   since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him    his features are such that even when he smiles   there s something mistrustful about him   and when he scowls   he is evil incarnate    he s something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher   but a cheaper model    like dicaprio and winslet   zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well    backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy   cal s personal assistant   or   man   as they said at the turn of the century      no matter who else is in the cast   you can always count on a good performance by warner   who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match    additionally   there are a number of smaller fictional and non fictional roles thrown in for color   such as kathy bates as   the unsinkable   molly brown   danny nucci as jack s friend fabrizio de rossi   eric braeden as john jacob astor   and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie    nice to see dr   bombay getting work    also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die    this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic   but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship s crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else    in this way   titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures    you don t just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop   but a very real account of class struggle as well    as i mentioned before   the budget for this film was tremendous   and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects    the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail   and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic    with regard to the exteriors   i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale    cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank   but only had room for 90%   and therefore had to computer generate the remaining 40 feet    could ve fooled me and everyone else in the theater   as the splicing is seamless    also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning    we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship   how the flooding occurred   the way the ship sank   and why it did so in that manner    these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening   and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction   in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion    in all   james cameron s titanic is a good blend of love story   history   and action    the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer s attention is held alternately by those three main elements   from the movie s intriguing beginning to it s satisfactory ending    in box office receipts   titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship    
Pos, in intolerance   d   w   griffith told four different historical stories at the same time   cutting from one to the other    each of the stories builds to a fast paced climax    in magnolia   paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others    yet the stories and where they are going are all independent    what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized    each story builds to a tense moment   or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment   but then lets the tension dissolve    while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along   even though they are not in the same scene    then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again    it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked    this creates some strange effects    the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships    the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content    we have the story of a dying man earl partridge   jason robards   wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends    phil parma   philip seymour hoffman   is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal    partridge s young wife linda   julianne moore   is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies   but for an unsuspected reason    frank mackey   tom cruise   runs the kinds of self help seminar that businesses like so much   but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women s lib    officer jim kurring   john c   reilly   is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place    jimmy gator   philip baker hall   hosts a popular children s tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector   jeremy blackman   and former quiz kid donnie smith   william h   macy      the film juggles all these stories for over three hours   but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily    each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax   but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story    the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories    the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history   but it really has little to do with the content of the stories   though they all are connected in part by one weird event    magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson   though in my opinion his two previous films   hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories    it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson s company    john c   reilly seems to be a standard fixture    particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight    here he several of the characters are mesmerizing   but that characteristic is not really used    as studies of characters these stories are each worth following    as well rounded stories with a beginning   middle and end   they leave something to be desired    but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through    i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the  4 to +4 scale    heavy spoiler        heavy spoiler        heavy spoiler        heavy spoiler        during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen    and in actual fact   it does    since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods    it is   however   a perfectly natural   if somewhat unnerving   phenomenon    the cause is associated with whirlwinds    we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air   holding them aloft    the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister    smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are    when the whirlwind is over water   animals near the surface   frequently fish and frogs   may suffer the same fate    essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind   held aloft by updrafts   and finally dropped elsewhere    so while the rain is possible   some doubts do creep in    the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs    it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped    it is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon       frankly i have no idea on these points      otherwise the event was quite believable    what we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano    in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8   2       and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people   and upon all thy servants      however a rain of frogs   though it feels biblical   is most definitely not a biblical portent    note that the previous verse says   and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up            so the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river    the only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16   13    
Pos, in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see    i realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike    but in the case of american beauty   i must make an exception    if you haven t yet seen it   go see it    now    stop reading this review and head for your local multiplex   then after you ve seen it   come back    i ll wait here    welcome back    if you followed my advice   and i see no reason why you should not have   do you        i m sure you ve just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life    american beauty is an extraordinary film   a powerful   jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream    it s humorous but it isn t funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production    mixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended   and by god   it works   making it one of the year s very best    lester burnham   kevin spacey   has entered the mother of all mid life crises    he is living life without a purpose    he is bored   depressed and sick of his sheltered   insignificant existence    he barely ever talks to his family   has no sex life   is stuck at a dead end job and thinks he has no reason to live    but one day   when he and his equally troubled wife   annette bening   attend one of his daughter s   thora birch   cheerleading performances   he sees something that makes him come alive    what he sees is the performance by his daughter s friend   the head cheerleader    he develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl   an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature    but for the first time   lester feels that he is actually living    this crush is only the beginning    lester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life   buying the car of his dreams   cursing off the boss and quitting his job     today i quit my job   told the boss to f * * * himself and blackmailed him for $60   000    would you pass the asparagus please          buying drugs from the voyeur next door   ricky fitts   a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be   beauty     and refusing to be docile in family affairs    his new attitude further alienates his daughter   only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be   and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor    and the burnhams s neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramatic momentum    ricky fitts   wes bentley   serves as the film s thematic center   providing the obscure   powerful meaning of the title    colonel fitts   the father   is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie   even considering his limited screentime    kevin spacey has never been better   and this performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel    he never plays his droll character as a freak   rather   he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic self exploration by his dissatisfaction with life    spacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime    equally astonishing is young thora birch   who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness    at two hours and ten minutes   american beauty didn t feel nearly long enough    it s a complicated   unforgettable film that   like the ice storm two years ago   dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life    powerfully and cynically   it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream    it claims that this picture perfect image is just that    an image   and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it    the dark   deeply ironic ending   though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie   stays with you for weeks after it s all over    american beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released   even more so considering it s a masterpiece    
Neg, in the continuation of warner brother s franchise   joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow    what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film    avika goldsman s screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another    this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as   the client   is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke    situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another    this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone s batgirl   who just happens to be alfred s niece    the story of dr   victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought    while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife   dr   freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure   and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment    now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live    now the logic of that little sub plot escapes me    if mr   freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death   why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth    this is indeed a cold hearted man    the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory    she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal    she joins with mr   freeze in his plan to start a new ice age   destroying all animal life   therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them    the characters have no logic    batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films    now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin   bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure   constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships   while at the same time not really having any    george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him    to say that his performance is workman like is to be generous    his best performances are still on   e   r        bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend   played by elle macpherson     that it brings into question bruce s latent homosexuality    there is no spark and no passion   as there was for nicole kidman s psychologist in   batman forever     between bruce and anyone other than alfred    and even that relationship is very reserved    robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series    now he s just a spoiled kid    in   batman forever     burt ward wanted to be batman s partner and friend    now   robin is suffering from ego deficiency    robin s attraction for poison ivy is not believable   except for a boy around the age of 15    his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest   even though they are not related in a traditional sense    chris o donnell   once considered a rising star   successfully burns up on reentry with this performance    his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking    the less said about alicia silverstone s performance the better    this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film    she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it    this brings us to the villains    arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday    the most rediculous scene is during mr   freeze s imprisonment    the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film    it s almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member    umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part   showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status    her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in   sextette     1978      the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough    these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film    without going through the intricacies of the plot   there is one question that always comes to mind with this series   except for the first   batman       and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel    mr   freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video    every villain   even the minor ones   have to have a look   no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume    with this film   warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it s tv incarnation    the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows !    gwaaaa s   and clang s associated with the old series    you almost wonder if william dozier   producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film    the special effects   by john dykstra   and production design   by barbara ling   are the primary stars of this film    and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing    every set   from ivy s lair   the batcave   to freeze s hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come    there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film    everything is set for maximum exposure    the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have    there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on   the time machine     the growing plant scene   but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured    joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair    camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series    master shots pepper the action scenes   destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had    mr   schumacher is a good director    one just has to look back on the films   the lost boys       cousins     an underrated film   and   the client   to know that    but   batman and robin   comes off as a mated made for tv movie    the film has no style of individuality    it is the cinematic equivalent to jell o   pretty to look at   but empty    it is unfortunate that this film   even with it s surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warner s thought tim burton would do with the franchise    kill it    joel schumacher s   batman & robin   is loud   colorful   action packed   and ultimately      boring    stars    
Neg, it rocks actually   lots of rocks fly at us or from us   in slow or fast motion   at several points in the film    they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward   and when they land once in a while   when we need a break from the space sequences they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like       nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur      they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon   a steroid user s answer to deep impact    bruce willis stars as harry stamper   a famed oil driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond   zero barrier   and destroys our planet    why an oil driller    they require someone experience with deep core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid       in one unintentionally        hilarious sequence   nasa asks harry to inspect a deep core driller they built based on his blueprints   it is poorly constructed harry criticizes almost every aspect of it    we trust nasa to build space shuttles      harry assembles the obligatory   ragtag   bunch of   cowboys     including a blond guy   a fat guy   a black guy   a wiseass   and the man who is sleeping with his daughter   affleck      once they reach space   we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it   i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes    whether or not they save the day   i will not reveal    nor will you care    i will say this   you know you re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope    willis has barely a chance to come alive   ditto for affleck    their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act   in a last minute and futile attempt to inject warmth into the material    steve buscemi s character the wiseass is exceptionally problematic       rockhound     as he s called   is sarcastic and foolish   so they tape him to a chair   where he spends most of the film    so why did they bring him up there to begin with    rather   why write him into the film    give  his almost witty one liners to serious willis   who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies   at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter   firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig    i m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel   at least in my world where the sky is blue    liv tyler is pretty and humourless   as always   suspiciously   four of her father s band s     aerosmith     songs grace the soundtrack    director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick   like ketchup   eventually drowning the movie on screen       the middle hour is a non sensical   pyrotechnic assault on the average primate s brain      whenever someone dies in this movie   a crew member inevitably yells out   we lost   insert dead person s last name here   !    i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil guy cum astronaut from a live one   and close ups of the corpses  faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance   as their skin was often covered in fake blood    armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla    it looks nicer   and has fewer plot holes within its equally ludicrous framework    it has a vivid soundmix    but at almost two and a half hours   i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story    the love story has been played up in the ads   perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic fever    bollocks !  the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon crawler    remember a little film called jaws    in this film   three independent minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark    they didn t much like each other at first   eventually   they started to respect one another    one of jaws  great scenes involved the would be ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories    this is the sort of male bonding foreign to bay or his producer   jerry bruckheimer   who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end    not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances i d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before   action   was called    a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don t bare their souls   who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest beating bravery    to this   i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic   nor brave   nor smart   even   this team couldn t build a birdhouse    and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer a trailer for a movie written by a team of body builders and greeting card authors i ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life

Neg, synopsis   melissa   a mentally disturbed woman who likes to smoke   seduces doug   a minor league baseball player who likes to study anatomy   work on motorcycles   and make out with his girlfriend in a public library    when doug decides to stop seeing her   melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him   including his girlfriend   his mother   and his cat    comments   malicious   i suppose   is an acceptable moview for what it is   a cheap   b movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned psycho lover who wants revenge films   like fatal attraction   hand that rocks the cradle   etc   etc     that have come before it    malicious   however   really doesn t provide very many particularly suspenseful moments    the plot starts off energetically enough   the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film    it starts to drag   unfortunately   after this    melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug   as always seems to happen in movies like these     but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other   better thrillers before    she drugs someone    she kills a family pet and leaves it in the girlfriend s apartment    and   of course   she stalks   so we see a number of shots   which are supposed to be suspenseful   where she s spying on doug and his girlfriend    i won t reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey   but i warn you that it s both painfully obvious and a real yawner    john vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the not so bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa   one of the script s faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a pre med student      the same cannot be said   though   for molly ringwald    at times   she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine   especially during her silent   i m going to stare you down scenes    at other times   however   she just seems somehow goofy and out of place    in one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful   she screeches   f  k you   you b     d   and throws a phone    she delivers the line so ridiculously that one can t help but laugh    malicious certainly isn t the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks   a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there     but it isn t all that good or original either    feel free to treat this film maliciously   watch something else    
Pos, synopsis   private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband    after uncovering the authenticity of the film   welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers    comments   8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time    though it doesn t present a snuff film   a movie which documents a person s murder for real   usually during or after some form of sexual act   as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as   say   natural born killers   8 mm stays in your head long after you see it    it is not fun to watch   see something else if you get upset by realistic   sadistic violence    this film s violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc 17 territory    for those with strong stomachs   however   8 mm is an intelligent   worthwhile thriller   especially during its second hour    nicolas cage   after a couple ho hum movies   returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities    as tom welles   a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly born daughter   cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants    serving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix   who plays a struggling songwriter named max california    california   despite his name   is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character   and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character    the real star of the movie   though   must be peter stormare    stormare played the   really   really evil guy   in fargo   and his character   dino velvet   in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable    his performance is very chilling    8 mm s success may hardly be surprising    it was directed by joel schumacher   who   hopefully   saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin    before directing the last two batman duds   however   schumacher was responsible for several well made horror flicks   lost boys   flatliners   and falling down    8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self destructs before the audience s eyes    8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker   who also penned the academy award winning thriller seven a few years back    like seven   8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater    welles is searching for answers    how could anyone possibly drug and then slowly   methodically   sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film    when confronting one of the perpretrators at the end   the murderer responds that there are no reasons    he just enjoys it    that   walker seems to suggest   is where the real terror lays   not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist    a couple minor faults led me to my four star rating   five stars is the highest rating i give      one   i found it a little difficult   early on   to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film    yes   snuff is a horrible thing   but a detective of welles  caliber has probably encountered awful things before    second   some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient    he discovers   for example   the victim s diary in her private bathroom   despite the fact the the police   the fbi   and her own mother have all investigated the room before    finally   the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film    despite the above criticisms   8 mm is an engrossing story    one of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles   who no longer seems like a hero   brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film    he pulls a gun on the man and   for a relatively long amount of time   struggles to decide whether or not to kill him    he then leaves the building and calls the victim s mother   in the middle of the night   to basically see if she would support the action    the entire scene is tense   unpredictable   and emotionally charged    rarely   anymore   do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm   with scenes like this   did    8 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart    this is a graphic   oftentimes unflinching   look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people    if you re prepared for a film of this nature   i give it an enthusiastic recommendation    
Neg, the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole        and   in the future   it s also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole    naturally   this is the setup for the other event horizon        the movie    when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at   just outside of neptune   the crew of the ship called the   lewis and clark   has to go to investigate   and dr   william weir   the creator of the   event horizon     gets to come along for the ride    if you ve glanced at a poster for this movie   you know that   supposedly   what follows is   infinite terror      well   i don t know about the   terror   part   but   infinite   certainly seems to qualify        event horizon is a mean spirited   gory   sick excuse for a film    it starts off as an alien rip off   and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes    at least for those first 40 minutes it s an * interesting * rip off of alien    that s a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie   which seems to go on forever    it not a scary monster movie   nor is it a psychological thriller    it is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore    you ve seen this kind of movie before    the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility    this is a kind of movie for which i have no respect   a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago    it is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore   but event horizon takes the low road   and the viewers pay the price    there are many good   respectable performances   from fishburne and neill most noticably    paul anderson s direction is impressive   as it was in mortal kombat    there are many nice special effects   mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero gravity    the sets are beautiful to gaze upon    and richard t   jones  character   cooper   is hilarious and extremely likable   more so than most characters i ve seen in recent movies   for the little screen time that he has    and none of this can save the movie from being a d grade level of film    the idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls   a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers   is a promising one    a haunted house story in space isn t such a bad idea    but the final execution is extremely disappointing    that s not to say that philip eisner   here making his feature film writing debut   doesn t have talent    for those first 40 minutes   he manages to make a tired premise interesting   adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip off story   and that s something that not too many writers can do    he even has one scene that   though it also tries to sicken the audience   has a honestly tense feel to it   the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space      he definitely has something of a gift   but it s not fully on display here    i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him   and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise    but because of what this movie degenerates into   i have little or no respect   and got little or no enjoyment   out of it    if this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film   then i agree with laurence fishburne s sentiment     god help us      
Neg, the last of vampire films offers plenty of blood and gore   but beyond that   nothing    jack crow   james woods   is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican    his and his men s mission is to clean the earth from vampires    they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered   but one has always escaped them    valek   thomas ian griffith     the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself    for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation   the black cross    with the cross in their possesion   the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight    after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth        i have never liked john carpenter and his style    after seeing this film   my opinions have not changed    john carpenter remains john carpenter    however   because of the film s self irony   black humour and fascinating cinematography   i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long   long time    neither the synopses or carpenter s direction are original    but there are some things that are interesting    the director s negative view on the catholic church   for instance    at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba   maximilian schell   has simply used crow and his team to find valek   so that he would gain eternal life    otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool   drinking   smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy    carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere    set in new mexican dessert   he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns   symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness    more than anything in this film   this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil    the cinematography by gary b   kibbe is probably the film s greatest achievement    music   composed by john carpenter himself   is at times effective   the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice    when it comes to the cast   in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem   everyone can scream and swing the axe !     but here james woods is suprisingly convincing    he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter   who lost his family to the   breed of evil      woods is constantly overacting   which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance    daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crow s loyal partner    the other cast members are struggling    because the film doesn t take itself too seriously   it stays afloat    still it is like most vampire films   a mediocre experience    
Neg, there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do    i delighted in the sneaky smart entertainment of ron underwood s big underground worm yarn tremors   i even giggled at last year s critically savaged big underwater snake yarn anaconda    something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth   spent in the company of ghidrah   the creature from the black lagoon and the blob    deep rising   a big undersea serpent yarn   doesn t quite pass the test    sure enough   all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place   a conspicuously multi ethnic/multi national collection of bait       excuse  me   characters   an isolated location   here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea   some comic relief   a few cgi enhanced gross outs   and at least one big explosion    there are too cheesy to be accidental elements   like a sleazy shipping magnate   anthony heald   who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology   or a slinky international jewel thief   famke janssen   whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold    as it happens   deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients    a terrorist crew   led by squinty eyed mercenary hanover   wes studi   and piloted by squinty eyed boat captain finnegan   treat williams     shows up to loot the cruise ship   the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew   a few survivors make it to the closing credits    and up go the lights    it s hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film making   especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream    here   the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j   o connor   generally amusing as the crew s fraidy cat mechanic    writer/director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action horror menace    something over populated with gore drenched skeletons   something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously    deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we re expected to have a ridiculous good time   not hide our eyes    case it point   comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda    in deep rising   one of the creature s victims is regurgitated back into view   partially digested and still alive    he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain   in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable    in anaconda   we also see a regurgitated victim   partially digested and still alive    he looks at another character       and  winks    make no mistake   deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing    it s also gloomy   uninspired and not nearly enough fun    i don t ask much of my monster movies   but i do ask that they act like monster movies    you don t have to show me a fantastically impressive   massive beast with tentacles a flailing    just show me the massive beast burping   and i ll figure you get the point    
Pos, there s a thin line between satire and controversy   and mike nichols   the birdcage   wolf   has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election    based on the book written by   anonymous     actually former   newsweek   writer joe klein     john travolta plays governor jack stanton    but he doesn t actually play stanton    he plays bill clinton   just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville   although the credits will of course say otherwise      the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton   adrian lester     a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton    he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations   and whether it be keeping the history of his boss  pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician   he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers    richard jemmons   billy bob thorton   and daisy green   maura tierney   team up with henry as the would be president s advisors   and hire lesbian veteran libby holden   kathy bates   as the campaign s eccentric   tougher than dirt   incriminator    together they face all sorts of sexual allegations   the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race    in its satire and controversy   primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog   they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty gritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue    but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media   primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it s characters   letting us understand what they want and why   and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent    seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look    and the rest of the cast also make superb performances   adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden    at occasions   you can t help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste    there are long slabs of time where john travolta   unquestionably the most interesting to watch   is missed from the screen   and since it is awkwardly structured as henry s story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot   or even the point of the film    having said that   make no mistake   primary colors is always enjoyable to watch    but frequently we have to ask ourselves   exactly what are we watching    most of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh   but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary   and almost unsuitable   to the rest of the film    but as i mentioned before   there is a thin line between satire and controversy   and for the most part   primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a far from overpowering look at winning the public s opinion    although at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely   focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is    thankfully   it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of something so really it s scary    
Pos, this british import follows the   mis    adventures of a group of heroin crazed scottish youths    there is marc renton   who narrates     spud   the dim witted one   sick boy   the sean connery obsessive     and begbee   the violence obsessive      powered by a top rate   but not top name soundtrack   iggy pop   sleeper   elastica   lou reed         the film follows renton who gets clean   gets back into heroin and gets clean again    some of the wit in this movie is sharp and pulp fiction esque   and some is just dumb & dumber gross   the bed sheets   and stupid   the bb gun   although the film starts out on a comic note   it takes a sharp term in the middle   and becomes almost depressing    the film is based on an irving welsh novel bearing the same title    i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen    it is an obscure gem that has been over shadowed in the us by such movies as mission impossible and id4    the film is hard to follow with the heavy accents of the actors    this is a very original film   as far as films go today    it definetly deserves multiple viewings   partly because of the slang and accents   jeremy dennison mr   orange@centuryinter   net

Pos,    rebel without a cause   is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to    everyone feels that they are different in some way   that they don t belong in some places and   rebel without a cause   successfully shows on screen these universal emotions    no matter what generation you belong to   these feelings are present    this is why james dean is admired by america   because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute    in our minds   we just try to do the right thing just like dean s jim stark does    not only does   rebel without a cause   display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure    each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection    this is because times change and in response people change    no matter how popular you were once   as your generation grows older   newer breeds look at you in a different light    this is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents    even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past   the teens could not believe this    in one humorous scene   stark   his girlfriend judy   natalie wood     and his pal plato   sal mineo   pretend they are adults    they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored    this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another    speaking on behalf of my generation   i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by    the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation   same  goes for brando   redford   even deniro    i can only imagine how vaguely matt damon   ben affleck   and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century    will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten    any film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film    even if   rebel without a cause   has some ridiculous scenes   the game of chicken   did people really act this way       an unbelievable conclusion   how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end       and a silly romance   wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours   it still is a fabulous film    the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool    now   however   the coolness is fading        
Neg, a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature   beams itself onto a russian science vessel    well   this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci fi thriller    anyhow   this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the   virus  known as man    the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated   and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it    no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies   the movie is that predictable    the story is full of very shallow characters that don t do much other than subsist    the captain of the tug   played by donald sutherland   makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age   looks to be in his 60 s      to add to this we re shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields   and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks    some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific   in a typhoon no less    none of the characters seem to work together at all   they are always bickering and vying for some form of control    this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story   a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable    all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects    the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves    it looks genuinely fake   granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish    also on the topic of flaws   the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly   why    if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics   should it not be able to create them move faster    regardless   the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it    as to the actual casting for the movie   finally there is nothing to complain about    the actors were superb   but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles    having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe    watching these actors act this story out made it bearable   if barely    the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening    so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci fi thriller then you won t be too disappointed    as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens   it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect    this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv    
Pos, call me crazy   but i don t see saving private ryan as the film of the summer    a good movie   yes   with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare    an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg s best work   no    personally   if i was spielberg   i wouldn t go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler s list and the indiana jones movies    i m guessing steve has a thing for nazis   i really wouldn t be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie    all lofty pretenses aside   saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick    the difference is   it s easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon s chest while blood spurts like crazy   but it s damn hard to sit and eat reese s pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield    and believe me   there s plenty of it    a 30 minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain   tom hanks   and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire    lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on   and all the young men in the audience find themselves never   ever wanting to be drafted    cut to some bureaucratic defense office   where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties    one woman happens upon an interesting detail    three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat   and their mother is getting the telegram today    i guess it s an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother   so the army chief   harve presnell   sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission   to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home    that way   the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs   ryan    one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it s a mission designed to make the army look good    they question the worth of risking eight soldiers  lives to save one   and hanks  character admits he doesn t give a damn about ryan   he s just following orders    if this was a john wayne movie   things would be different    there d be a phony     let s go get that boy   gosh darn it !    attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war    by doing things this way   spielberg admits the instincts of self  preservation and complacency that every normal person has    it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone driven stallone movie mission    the movie s pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi introspective conversation among the soldiers    hanks is painted first as a nails tough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men    it s not that way for long    edward burns   the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isn t available   is the impulsive one    jeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time   and so on    none of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes   but was spielberg s obvious intention    i wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long   how were they going to fill three hours  time searching for one person and still make it interesting    there are a few false starts   hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson s company   apparently   danson joined the army after   ink   was canceled     and breaks the bad news before learning it s the wrong ryan    and of course the movie s far from over when hanks does locate ryan   matt damon   the other guy you get when affleck isn t available      that s when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick   although body parts and limbs still fly like never before    saving private ryan is worth your time   but it s definitely no schindler s list    the battle scenes are intense and realistic   but some of the attempts at sincere emotion aren t    the movie s bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place   when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out   whining     tell me i ve led a good life    tell me i m a good man      spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any three hour movie about the past should be framed by a self contained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present    much more effective are subtler scenes   like the one where several of hanks  men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers   and they make light of what they re doing by pretending they re playing poker    this while an airborne division marches by   their eyes full of that mound of dogtags    by not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war   the audience gets the message    and even if it s not a classic   saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there    
Neg, chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception   instead of a speeding bus   we now have an ice cream truck    the truck is driven by arlo   cuba gooding jr     and mason   skeet ulrich     who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder    this particular weapon   nicknamed `elvis    must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees   or else the shockwave will goo iffy everything in a mile radius    that would be pretty nasty    the power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene   as dr   richard long   david paymer   conducts a test on an isolated tropical island    long accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island   due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance    the commanding officer   general brynner   peter firth     is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops    upon his release   the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down   snatching elvis   and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder    protecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper   ulrich   and a feisty ice cream delivery man   gooding jr       who must elude brynner s men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder    all the while   of course   they must keep the weapon below 50 degrees    this proves to be tricky    among the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is a trip down a tree covered mountainside in a boat   and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle    they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing    to put it simply   i ll use a clever pun   chill factor should be put on ice    director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed   broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a chase movie    when there is some occasional action   the audience seems oddly detached from it    perhaps that s because we ve already waded through a pool of clich   s and boring dialogue   all material that s been used before   and with a lot more spice    take the villains   for example    they are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen    they speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movie to the next   divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint   and act in very predictable ways    the tag team of gooding jr   and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is    frankly   i m not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man    i suppose it s better than him dressed like a giant hot dog   selling jumbo frankfurters on a street corner    gooding displays one single emotion in this movie   which is frequently on display in lines like `i m gonna get on yo ass like last year s underwear !   and the incessant sputtering of `oh   sh * t !    this is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets    but where gooding was once an exciting actor   he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous    at least he s a bit more captivating than ulrich   who has all the film s worst dialogue   but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character    the supporting cast   which includes every personality you expect to pop up   is also wasted    to be fair   there are a few brief moments of serviceable action    and i did chuckle a few times    one example is when ulrich   an employee at `darlene s diner    is at the counter when brynner walks through the door    `you own this place      the general asks    `yeah     ulrich says    `they call me darlene      these little tidbits of humor are   mainly   welcome in this weak   disappointing wreckage of an action film    as a speed clone   it could have benefited from a lot more suspense and perhaps   god forbid   even some decent writing    sadly   i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been    
Pos, contrary to the title     the boxer   is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics    it s actually three movies in one   a political film   a boxing film   and a love story    all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story   but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal    we ve seen it all before   and we re just not blown away with it like we should be    oh well    it s still an excellent irish story       the boxer   of the title is danny flynn   jim sheridan staple daniel day lewis     an ex ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years   and finds out that his troubles are far from over    first off   the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill   brian cox     and one of its sub leaders   harry   gerard mcsorley     both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail    while this is going on   danny and his old drunkard buddie   ike   ken stott   who played the chief inspector in danny boyle s   shallow grave       re open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects   protestant and catholics   to work together    danny not only begins teaching kids how to box   but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison   and is ready to start boxing real people again    and danny runs into his ex love   maggie     breaking the waves    s emily watson     who hasn t seen him since he went in    they don t easily start up their romance again because she s the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny s tenure in prison   and also has a son   liam   ciaran fitzgerald     from him   whom liam is hoping will get out soon    but the two are slowly re drawn to eachother again   and this begins to complicate things    the political story is nothing really special but works in itself    we ve seen it many a time before   but it s at least interesting   sometimes emotional   and even riveting at times    there s a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty    the boxing story is very minor to the story   but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly   and even with good sportsmanship    there are only a few boxing scenes   but they re never like   raging bull   /let s strip down the sport to its bones brilliant    they re more realistic   and instead of bone crunching   we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother   which is slightly unerving at times    and i didn t know daniel day lewis was in such good shape    but the backbone of the story is the love one    because these characters are given such horrible circumstances   and since the two leads have such great chemistry together   we really feel for their plight    as the film goes on   and circumstances get worse and worse   the characters have to make real human decisions   and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters    this is how you write a love story   take note   hollywood    these elements are pretty much equally balanced   with each of the parts of the stories working hand in hand with eachother    i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered   and sometimes spilled over into the next    it made sure that we didn t just care for one of them    i m not saying they re all equally great   because the love story really carries the film   but at least they all work out respectively    the acting is amazing   with day lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry    i m not sure if they re oscar nominee bound   but they re very good    in the supporting roles   billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers    but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike   who is just a great scene stealer    the direction and co writing by jim sheridan   with the other co writing credit going to terry george   is excellent   rounding out the characters well   but not pacing everything greatly    i noticed that the first half was very leisurely   yet fascinating     but the second half whirls by at a quick pace   and ends much too quickly    more time could have been spent thinking up the ending   since it does seem quite sloppy    though   the boxer   is a good film   it never achieves the greatness that it should    sure   it s a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get   but on it s own   it just could have been better    but it still works out   gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama   and features great acting    even if it could have been better   this ll do    
Pos, even if i did not know that director and co writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x files   i would have inevitably made a connection    the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon  like plot   to the mysterious characters   to the overall dark   ominous settings    it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case   they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis   in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie      another more important similarity   is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time    this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie   especially when compared to some of the trash   of the same genre   released in the last couple of years   urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch      what helps final destination is its unique premise    unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders   the villain presented is unusual   it s the grim reaper    this being already has predestined when and how you will die    according to the brief history lesson given in this film   everyone was meant to die at a certain time   some people at 100   others at 17   whatever death chooses    what is unique about death is that it s already dead   so you can t really kill it    the only way to defeat death is to cheat it   the question is how do you do that    this dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers    alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash   leaving no survivors    alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off    shortly after   the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal    however   death isn t through with them yet    it gradually kills off the seven one by one   leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again    the plot allows for some of the most creative   original death scenes i have seen in a while    some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax   others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock    creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films    sure   it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders   ali larter s character is particularly annoying     but the shocks   from the beginning to the end   are extremely entertaining    also director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously    he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won t win any academy awards   not even a golden globe      the myriad of inside jokes and gags   the characters are named after famous horror directors   one character who plays a jerk is named carter   like x files creator chris carter   and a song by john denver   who died in a plane crash   plays whenever death is near   show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie    and from this   i had a great time watching the movie    
Pos, i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x files    first   let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie    the producers are not stupid   making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable    you have to reach for a larger audience    therefore   the movie is quite user friendly    altough   non fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange    but fear not   duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on    you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera    in any case   the answer is no    i am not a fan of the x files   i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium    however   since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie    i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie   i am glad to report that i learned nothing new    everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others    i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie    warning   major spoilers follow !  please do not read   to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming   what exactly is over that hill and what that weird   hummm   sound is all about    you have been warned    the x files is what a summer should be    exciting   scary   great special effects   unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary   and good performances    this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank    from start to finish   this movie does not let go of you    when i compare it with last summer s movies the best way to describe it would be   take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon    this flick is scary   not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes    in fact   the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue    you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd !  the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid    you know   when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair   or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt    so yeah   the x files is scary    and guess what    you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed   computer generated   babyzilla   it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster    do not think that the x files is a monster movie    in fact   the creature is there for maybe three minutes total    no   the x files is definately a mulder episode of the series    scully is at his side   of course   but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time    she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny   but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much    no   this is mulder s time in the spotlight    by now   you have heard of the scene where mulder   showers   independence day    if you have not then i will not spoil it for you   let s just say that due to recent events mulder should be   showering   godzilla instead    to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there       who  cares !    if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about    the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous    the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill    the script is spotless   every thing that happens happens for a purpose    if you are confused by something   do not worry because it will all become clear later on but   and i cannot stress this enough   pay attention ! ! !  unlike most summer movies   the dialogue is twice as important as the effects    miss one vital piece of information and   like most people who talk during movies   you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense    also   to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies       don t !  the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation    there is no time to take a breather between scenes because   again unlike most summer movies   godzilla anybody       the x files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots   every scene is crucial and serves a purpose    who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a   big emotional scene   between godzilla attacks    so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose    but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie   the x files is    what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited    cool effects    it s good some    pulse pounding    hell yes !  strangely enough   i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non fans will have a good time    it does not provide answers to the show s many questions   the status quo remains nearly the same and   no   mulder and scully do not get together    rating   four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer   several jump right out of your seat thrills   many   whoah   i never saw that one coming !    moments   four   holy shit   where the hell did that come from   and one heck of an ending    you may wonder where this movie lost half a star    well   i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck   the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop    it s pretty obvious the film s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time   but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving    
Pos, it is with hesitance that i call   apocalypse now   a masterpiece    certainly   it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made   with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease   and some of the finest actors of the 1970 s    the plot   an adaptation of joseph conrad s   heart of darkness     was set in vietnam   and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant   coming on the heels of the end of the war       apocalypse   certainly has its moments   some of which are the finest in film history    the plot is fairly simple    captain willard   sheen     is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty    his mission is simple   take a boat up to cambodian territory   and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz   brando     with extreme prejudice      along the way   willard runs into a series of adventures   including one with lt   col   kilgore   duvall     and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies    willard  s four person crew finally make it to kurtz  compound   where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives    willard s experiences with kurtz take up the last half hour   with a confrontation and eventual ending    the movie is visually breathtaking    the battle scenes are exquisitely done   and the score is brilliant   setting a murky mood of darkness that is first rate    the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening    the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning   and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie    the journey to kurtz  camp is quite a ride   with psychosis setting in on almost every character    the most interesting one is kilgore   the lt   col   who cares more about the surf than about the mission    it is at times revolting   psychotic   and incredible   and it is one hell of a movie    the scenes are bold   inventive   and powerful   and the acting is stunning   especially be sheen   duvall   and fishburne    the narration is exquisite   as is the mystery of kurtz    coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam   kind of like   saving private ryan   on lsd    the film is jarring in its implications   and psychotic in its execution    the problems come when the film slows down    one of the major scenes in the film   where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz   is a colossal mess    the dialogue is confusing   the lighting is atrocious   and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film    the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound    the film slows down to a drag    sheen seems forever captured by a madman   played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received    brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes   but is bathed in shadows the entire time   making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic    the scenes are poorly done   the dialogue is muffled   and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief    sheen seems to adore this man   but why the viewers are never told    the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god like kurtz   but the scenes fall way short of expectations    granted   it has its moments   which are brutally horrific   but the general feeling is one of confusion    brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir   and my feeling was that this could never be a great man   this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him   so why do they do it    there are moments of brilliance   but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene    there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending    the finest scene at the end is sheen s escape   and his entrace into the temple    his rise out of the water   with the smoke coming off of his slicked head   is a brilliant 30 seconds of film    yet   you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done    the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times   and indeed the film on the whole is very good    it is a stunningly flawed expression of film   for it addresses major issues   such as man s mental stamina during bouts of war    but one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful   had the character of kurtz been more explored   and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for    there is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece   but it could have been so much more rewarding    
Neg, it seemed like the perfect concept    what better for the farrelly brothers   famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter   than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality    it s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish   poking fun at something serious   in this case mental illness     throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh    jim carrey s signed on too    even better    the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers  new film before its opening   claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality   labeling it incorrectly as   schizophrenia     and so forth    such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would   of course   only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers  fire   proving that some people just couldn t take a joke   and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy    yes   it all seemed perfect   but one thing went wrong   their movie isn t funny    it s not for lack of trying    the farrellys utilize in   me   myself & irene   their most high concept premise ever   carrey plays charlie baileygaites   a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver   decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them    this   of course   means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too forgiving nature   making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult    soon enough   charlie s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second   independent personality named hank   a deep voiced   boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster    this guy isn t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he s been insulted   or holding a little girl s head underwater because she refused to stop jump roping in the street    then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted   and the film runs off its tracks    some have suggested that this isn t a problem   because the farrelly brothers  brand of humor doesn t require plot to work    they re wrong   of course   plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys  last effort   1996 s   there s something about mary         1999 s   outside providence   was technically an earlier project      the brothers  earlier film wasn t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags   despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe     but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected    in   mary     the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight of hand trick   they d have you thinking the story was going one way   then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion       me   myself & irene     by contrast   seems to have been made by folks who looked at   mary   and saw only the surface grossness   missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work    having been produced by the same guys who made   mary       irene   seems like an even bigger disappointment    the brothers pile on the offensive humor   taking shots at race   midgets   albinos   mental illness   and all manner of bathroom jokes    but they haven t come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of   me   myself & irene   comes off as rote   by the numbers   adolescent comedy    the plot   with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p   waters   renee zellweger     who s in more trouble than anyone knows   back to new york   has an ending that s entirely predictable from the get go       think charlie and irene will fall in love    yeah   me too      the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters   and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven t already expected them to do   no matter how outrageous their actions might be    compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing   this stuff is almost entirely soft tossed   presenting an obvious problem   when gross out humor loses its shock value   it s no longer funny   merely gross    the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry    take   for example   the subplot involving charlie s three black sons   anthony anderson   mongo brownlee   jerod mixon      the incongruity of it all is funny for a while   with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too pleasant smile on his face    but by the end of the film   they re still doing the same schitck it hasn t been elevated to another   funnier level   and it hasn t been dropped either    that s too bad   because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through       me   myself & irene   reeks of wasted opportunities    there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie s new personality   and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank s actions    this doesn t really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie s condition early on   so they don t have any opportunity to be surprised by it    the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point   involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called   appropriately     whitey       but the script doesn t go anywhere with it   instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax    jim carrey is a gifted comedian   both physically and vocally   but he s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in   all of me      it s a great showcase of flexibility and split second role shifting   but none of it is terribly funny    carrey doesn t pull any stunts we don t expect him to pull   and the farrellys  script doesn t give him anything else to pull   the situations in which he must perform the role shifting aren t set up in any meaningful way    perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better    zellweger s irene is not a strong female lead mary in   mary   may have been part adolescent fantasy   but she was also intelligent and strong willed    irene is nothing in particular   as the film never makes clear whether she s ditzy   clever   or neither    as such   she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only   sane   person in the film    chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent   and his character is entirely too straight laced for a movie like this    he   like the others   does absolutely nothing unexpected    after viewing the shapeless mess that   me   myself & irene   eventually dissolved into   i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves    maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked    but i don t believe it    good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style    if the farrellys are indeed good   smart filmmakers   and i still think they are     they ll rebound just fine    even after that happens   though   i ll still consider   me   myself & irene   to be a high caliber misfire    
Neg, michael richards leaves his spot as kramer on the infamous seinfeld tv sitcom for a stint as a lanky   goofy best friend to jeff daniels  lawyer character in this ill fated   and unfunny     comedy      plot   richard the actor   richards   has to take the place of charles the lawyer   daniels   in a real court case   after charles is left unintelligible from a night of heavy drinking at his bachelor party    the film follows the antics of the two men as they try to get away with their tomfoolery    critique   this movie did not make me laugh once    perhaps it was because i was tired when i watched it    perhaps    perhaps it was because i had seen richards perform most of the same schtick a thousand times on seinfeld    perhaps    perhaps it was because the movie just wasn t funny    absolutely    the lack of humour wasn t the only issue that i had with this film either    the movie attempts to weave a couple of love stories through its vision   but unfortunately   they are also lacking in conviction   believability and credibility    they are contrived and appear to be placed into the story for convenience sake    the actors were all adequate enough in their roles   but the problem didn t lie in the acting    i wish i could find one good reason for you to see this waste of time   but i can t    unless of course   you need something playing on your tv set while you waste some time around the house    overall   this movie stinks    on the good side   charlize theron is darn cute   and the movie is no longer then 90 minutes    on the bad side   this movie is not funny   interesting or enjoyable in any which way possible    a person wouldn t even enjoy his nachos while watching this emptiness    please skip it    little known facts   jonathan lynn earned a degree in law from cambridge before becoming an actor/director    charlize theron grew up on a farm outside benoni   south africa   as the only child    at the age of 18 her mother made her go to los angeles to try a career in the movie industry    she came to la without knowing anyone in the city but after two weeks when she was standing in line on hollywood boulevard an agent gave her his card    after eight months in la she got her first part    since then she has taken acting lessons and her career has skyrocketed   specifically in devil s advocate   8/10      charlize was narrowly beat out by elizabeth berkley for the lead role in the   movie     showgirls    she was quoted as saying   it was like i had some guardian angel      
Pos, so here is the second of 1999 s remakes of classic horror movies    the first was the dumb   pathetic but ok remake of the classic  the haunting     now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill    the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100   000 to stay in his house    if they survive the night they get the money    if not well you get the jurisdiction    having not yet seen the film   dvd on its way   i wasn t sure if i would really like the remake    but sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on    geoffrey rush   in a fantastic role with an incredible performance   is steven price   the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people    his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends    steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list    somehow someone   or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party    eddie   taye diggs   an ex baseball player   sarah   ali carter   an ex assistant who can re wire anything   melissa   brigette wilson   a talk show host in sorts   dr   blackburn   peter ghallager     and watson   chris kattan   a smart mouthed humorist in ways    what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1   000   000 dollars if they can survive through the night    if they can they get the money   if not well they don t    the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum    years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr   there   forcing him to lock the place up because if he died   so did they    everyone who was in there burned to death    now it is steven price s home and he is throwing this party for these five people    what starts out as a seemingly normal night   turns into a horrifying   blood splattering night    the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed    one by one the people start to disappear    conspiracies start to turn up   and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all    the people find rooms   which once held mental patients    rooms which once had people dying    rooms which may still contain these people    now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house   and they must survive each other with terrorfying results    since i officially haven t seen the original i can t say which is better    i can say however i liked this movie    geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price   and does a great job doing a vincent price role    famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times    ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs    chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines    peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims    the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing    the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy   and even sometimes downright scary    i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous    one thing i knew not to expect was a  haunting  type movie with special effects galore    even though it had fantastic gore and special effects   the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget   which doesn s show all the way through but you can tell    the movie was written well   and it s only major flaw is the under developed characters and plot holes that we are left with    the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it    i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise    i was expecting another haunting with special effects   no scares and a dumb ending    instead i found a good halloween movie with gore   scares and great acting    house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can t take seriously    though it is a well made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws    but besides that the movie is fun   smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can t be made all the time !  
Neg, some movies  pre release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they re finally released   everyone just goes along with it    thus sometimes   films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations    last year it was the thin red line    this year s   winner   is the hurricane   pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool    acclaimed director norman jewison s biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun    and that s supposed to be ok because   see   it s a true story    it s about rubin   hurricane   carter   denzel washington     a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly   racist !    detective   dan hedaya   who s had it in for the   big shot   hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife   in self defense but who cares   right      when rubin was only ten    he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole    most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison    to the rescue    lesra martin   vicellous reon shannon   and his team of wanna be detectives    lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well off canadian white people   hanna   unger   schreiber   to get an education    lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book      the sixteenth round     rubin s autobiography    immediately thereafter   schreiber s character tells lesra   sometimes we don t pick the books we read   they pick us      hmmm    after a few visits to the prison   they become convinced of rubin s innocence and launch their own full scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him    they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses   i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces     and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane s innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings    of course   we re already told that he s innocent    a movie like this is especially frustrating because we re not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life    all too obviously   we re getting the hollywood watered  down version    that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it    it s almost cruel    the melodrama isn t of the entertaining kind either   it s the hokey   rammed down your throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity    witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo saintliness of our four protagonists    the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it s a no frills courtroom movie    it s formula stripped to the bare necessities    you have your wrongly accused black man    you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene    but there s nothing else    you d expect some sort of involving investigation    but that s not necessary since we re implicitly informed of his innocence    thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding    brooding to himself    brooding to other inmates    brooding to lesra    brooding to lesra s canadian friends    brooding in letters    i don t think i ll ever look at brooding the same way again    it wasn t long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane s exceedingly deep meditations on his condition    i wanted something to happen    as for washington s performance in the title role    i figured i d have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it s received    he is top notch   though still boring    how is that possible    well   he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly    unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap    what a waste of a great performer    speaking of wastes   why the hell did john hannah agree to do this    he s an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly   but what is he doing here    to call his character   along with schreiber s and unger s   a stick figure would be a gross understatement    all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas   as benevolent as do gooders come    if they re to play a major part in this movie   why not make them real people   with real feelings and emotions    look   if you re going to make a formula movie   don t undermine the formula    courtroom dramas can be fun   but this is ridiculous    not only is it trite   it s boring    
Pos, the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber   the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse   and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest   little caper adventure entitled `where the money is      the elderly bank robber is henry   paul newman     a famous criminal that was only recently caught    he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune    always the shrewd thinker   he begins working on a plan to get out of jail    this involves years of studying buddhism and self hypnosis    when he is prepared to execute his plan   he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke    now a seemingly twitching vegetable   he is temporarily transferred to a state run home    carol   linda fiorentino   is the nurse that cares for him    she s a very bright person with a good heart    yet   her life is a miserable waste of time    the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars    her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics    worse   she s in a dead end relationship with high school sweetheart wayne   dylan mcdermott      they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom    to her   this made sense long ago    but now   it s a different story    wayne seems equally bored with his life   but is content enough to stay put    wayne s greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman    carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients   but she s never been anywhere else and doesn t see many other opportunities in life    however   when henry falls under her care   her outlook begins to change    the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke    carol   however   begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all    maybe she can get through to him   and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away    the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry   back to life      and what are some of carol s resuscitation techniques    perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses    if that fails   maybe she ll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20 foot high pier into the cold lake below    when he finally comes out of his state of self trance   the movie s direction changes   though it remains equally if not more entertaining    carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self assuredness    she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy    this   of course   puts wayne in an odd situation    henry and carol s bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car    henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash    meanwhile   this is carol s ticket to a better life    wayne is uncomfortable with the situation   but helps out nonetheless    however   his lack of commitment threatens their success    the heist sequence is suspenseful   well paced   and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong    `where the money is  does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist    newman is the real joy of the film   adroitly showing that at age 75   he s still really hot stuff    he possesses a sly smile   displays a dominating attitude   and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive    fiorentino is also a fun presence    you root for her despite her sense of amorality    sure   she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair stricken man into a lake   but we can see that to escape her dead end world   she needs to do something drastic    with two charismatic characters such as these   it s hard to ignore that `where the money is  is where the fun is    
Pos, this   dumb   cowboy blondie who thinks he is a `darn  good loverboy   decides to leave his dusty ol  town somewhere in texas and go to new york    he puts on his beloved cowboy attire and off he hops on the next new york coach    when he arrives to new york   he immediately sets out to play mr playboy thinking he is the best `darn  `stud  in the whol o  new york city    obviously he fails    he meets the  cripple  rico   dustin hoffman   who is terrifically good   in a bar    rico has a leg that is paralysed from the knee down   so he walks in a peculiar way    rico is a thief and wants to get some money off this  rich  dumb cowboy    he cheats our cowboy out of $20 through a somewhat detailed routine and disappears    soon   our cowboy runs out of money   he gets kicked out of his hotel   and starts getting hungry    walking through the city   with   everybody s talkin    playing in the background   oh   and his prided techno transistor radio in hand     he spots rico in a cafe    rico   half scared   pours out all the money in his pocket    60 filthy cents    our cowboy   hungry   is forgiving    he is glad he found someone he knows    rico offers to make it up for him    and he invites him to his place    and what a filthy   cold place it is    our cowboy falls asleep instantly in the   junk   bed    when he finally wakes   jumps      up   he finds rico looking at him       you wanna cup a coffee      rico asks in his friendly   sleazy   somewhat childish manner while he smokes on a ciggy       what re you    a goddamn faggot    what do you want from me    where are my shoes    what did you do to them      but all his doubts turn out to be unfounded    rico really has a heart    together   they live in the junk apartment and almost freeze to death    rico is convinced that the best place to be is florida   where the sun shines beautifully and there are lots of coconut trees    but he falls sick and is convinced that his cure is to go to florida       we will soon be in miami   is the last sentence uttered in this film and what a shocking   moving end of a film it is    the classic theme music     midnight cowboy   helps bring about the feeling of attachment that most viewers will experience towards the end of the film    whether the attachment is to the two main characters or to their dreams   is probably as debatable as whether it was the acting or the direction that makes this film so memorable    
Neg, ugh   that about sums this movie up    just   ugh    the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic   and when reviewing the previous films   each film had a certain degree of intelligence    and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following   in spite of bad special effects   horrible dubbing   and a man in a lizard suit   they maintained a certain degree of       how to put this          dignity    not quite the word i m looking for    you understand   right    and in 50 years   godzilla has maintained that degree of  whatever     leave it to america to screw the whole thing up    >from the  geniuses  that brought us   independece day     arguably the worst sci fi movie of all time   to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had    while they do bring us eye popping special effects that will amaze you   they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies    a storyline    summing up the movie is simple    heck   i can do it in one sentence   giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of nobodies stop it    simple as that    matthew broderick stumbles over his lines   and it s hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dog walking character on the television show   mad about you      the dialogue seems to be improvized   almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all    i can see the scene on the set right now       all right !  we spent all of this money making big special effects   and we ve gotta get this movie out by summer or it s going to bomb in our faces    so   you actors just say what ever comes to the top of your head   all right    make up something   m kay    good    roll film ! !    the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing   and some of the cinemtography is well done   the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind      still   an hour into it   you will become antsy   wondering how long they can drag it out    and drag it out they do ! !  i have to laugh    the slogan for the film is     size does matter      i think they cut this too short    it should read     size does matter    acting does not      
Neg,    have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming      obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment   and so to finish us utterly   they have now released   urban legends   final cut      this is another   scream    like feature   consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip offs from the most pointless movies of all time    amy   jennifer morrison   is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do    but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university s film program    where each year s best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize   a virtual one way ticket to hollywood success    she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese   loretta devine     whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines    soon enough   fake    and real    blood starts to flow   and amy is being chased around by scary killer   while her cast and crew get slain   one by one    is the culprit the original urban legends murderer   just some random psycho   !  a member of the faculty   one of her competitors for the hitchcock   or is there something even more stupid going on    this is another one of those tiring   pointless teen slasher flicks   neither scary   funny   or interesting    it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain    the body counts and screams continue to grow   as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly    in fact watching films like that after having watched   scary movie   is impossible keeping a serious face    several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing   without succeeding    and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing    it s the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century    how many times must we tolerate the same clich   s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth    it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them    they are the most stupid   meaningless   predictable and soulless films in existence    however   director john ottman manages to make   urban legends   final cut   into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre    what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in   scream     ottman takes seriously    for that reason alone   it is worth a look   just to realize how bad a movie can be    it s tough to find comparisons for such an achievement   and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect    even movies like   lost in space   and   mission to mars   seem spectacular in its shadow    we have not seen such waste of t !  ime and resources since   showgirls     1995      no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production   i came up with nothing   except the way the killer was dressed    here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie sylvie deveu   that have wisely replaced the well known scream mask with a very elegant fencing mask    jennifer morrison     stir of echoes     is all right   and the other actors  best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script    in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film   with the exception of its screenplay   is its portray of film schools    if these graduates will be the directors of the future   then hollywood s golden days are over    rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment    let s just hope and pray that it s just an urban legend    
Neg,    the animal   is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along   generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling    it s clunky and slow   like watching an 18 wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill    there are certainly better things you can do with your time    actually   if you ve seen the trailer   then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments    the story centers on bland marvin   rob schneider     who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer    but he s afflicted with loser itis    dogs attack him   neighbors torment him   children bully him   and his co workers ignore him    truthfully   with his bad haircut   seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic   little richard   and giant poodles   and his unenthusiastic demeanor   we d probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun    this is actually bad because you can t like a character if you can t develop sympathy for him    we never do   and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor    however   marvin is found by an eccentric doctor   michael caton   who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him   implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs    as a result   marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed    he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body   swim with the speed of a dolphin   and can run as fast as a cheetah    imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation    with his enhanced abilities   he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him    however   the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn   and instead   marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic   sexual urges    goats beware !  he also chases cats   urinates to mark his territory   or growls at his enemies    what he should ve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich    equally tenuous is its other running joke   which involves one of his friends   guy torry   who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he s black       it s reverse racism     he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything    this element doesn t work the first time it s mentioned   and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence    you don t have to be as wise as an owl to realize that   the animal   is tame    if there s any reason to see this film   it s to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut    remember her    she was voted off in week 11 of the 13 week program     survivor      here   she plays marvin s sunny love interest    while her role required very little actual acting   she seemed very comfortable   even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog       yuck !      with her adorable disposition   radiant smile   and playful innocence   she could be a meg ryan in the making    it s too bad that she s in such a mediocre offering  
Neg, a friend invites you to a movie    this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare   and be grounded in reality    the plot is as follows   after a terrifying incident   a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city    they need fresh air to get some perspective   maybe to start over    romance begins to brew   however   as one of the locals   played by an international superstar in rugged clothing   sparks things up     especially at a country western slow dance      it stars a rising young starlet   helms a good cast   and is directed by one of the better actor turned directors in hollywood    you accept    you jump at the opportunity to see   what you believe to be    the horse whisperer     but   poor moviegoer   you have been conned    alas   you find yourself watching   incredulously    hope floats     oh   woe    your hope has sunk    why was this movie made    why was it released    it is a travesty on nearly every level   and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved    at the hands of a better script   the film could have been a gem    but it is clueless as to what it is about   and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers     hope floats  stars sandra bullock as birdy   who   after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend   on national television no less     takes her daughter and drives back to her home   helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands     she decorates with stuffed wildlife      birdy s nephew   travis   played by  leave it to beaver  s cameron finley     is under her custody   and in one of the film s many failed in jokes   is always seen wearing a different halloween costume    what is the point of this    does it make any sense    is it supposed to be funny    the point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric   but i was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child    all of this undercuts the plot   of which there is none    there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion    there s the scene where birdy   who used to be the prom queen   is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked   for a job    there s the scene where birdy dances with her father   in the hospital for alzheimer s    and then there s the sentimental scenes with justin   played by harry connick jr     who is taking a liking to her again   showing her a beautiful pad that he built from scratch    and during each of these scenes   i was sidetracked by my earlier question    what sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume   a kermit costume   a cowboy costume   with whip     and a full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner    what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life    outside of this   there are other sure signs of screenwriters block    when the daughter stands up to the bully at school    when birdy almost loses her job    when the family pulls in a goofy lip synch to cheer someone up    when someone dies    when the daughter cries     no   wails   in exasperation that her father is not coming back    in a movie like this   you notice the strings being pushed   and you sit there   comatose   hoping it will end    who can survive such a debacle    i worry for bullock s career   which has been running on auto pilot for the last few years    she has an attitude   a solid perkiness   and can drive a bus  but she can t handle the emotional scenes   much less hold a southern accent    harry connick   jr   is worse  stick with singing   or get some acting lessons   please !  gena rowlands is the best part of the film    but she s such a good actress   that it staggers the mind that she s weighed down by such lukewarm material here    it would be a severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes  great films is known for this film    two notes to forest whittaker     1   cut the slow motion sequences    there are twelve times where you undercut your own direction by such a failed trick    have you done so   you could have shaved off ten minutes of this almost unbearable debacle       2   you ve had to know something was wrong if your cinematographer s filter makes the candlelight appear like little   x   s    you re not a bad director   but you can t change a terrible script    there s a recurring scene where birdy   working at the neighborhood fotomat   finds the machine go wrong   and image after destroyed   warped   dark image appear    think about it    a succession of destroyed images may have been more entertaining than this movie    
Neg, annie wilson   cate blanchett     a widow who struggles to raise her children in a small town in georgia is asked for help by local authorities in solving the case of a missing woman    annie is something of a psychic   she has involuntary bouts with the supernatural where she can see the past and the future and physically feel the actions happenning to her she envisions    her   gift   leads to the arrest of a nasty wife beater who may or may not have killed the pretty rich girl found in the swamp on his property    in an ultra conservative backwoods town will her testimony based on her psychic visions hold up in court    do they even have the right man    what s good about it    aside from keanu reeves giving one of the best performances of his career as the loathable redneck donnie barksdale   there is little else going for the film    what s not so good about it    lame   unoriginal screenplay    predictable ending    suspense scenes that are just plain boring    ridicously trite characterization makes the entire south out to be ingnorant   hateful goobers    relentless in its emotional sensationaliztion    overall critique       the gift   is one of those movies that makes you wonder where you ve seen this story before    it s a collection of every cliche and stereotype of the south ever made   and coming from a yankee like me who dislikes the south that s really saying something    for an established   talented director sam raimi is unable to provide any kind of originality to this film    it s predictable from the first scene   the screenplay is written like a rip off of a photocopied bootlegged play    you know that as nasty as the murder suspect is he didn t actually do it    it s no surprise either who the real villain turns out to be and what their motive was    sigh   how trite    for a supernatural thriller this is neither scary nor intense because it s so cliche       the gift   is basically a glorified b movie    
Neg, battlefield long   boring and just plain stupid  battlefield earth  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  in my mid teen years   i had a horrendous re occurring nightmare    behind the wheel of a car   i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert    no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway    no matter what i did   the view didn t change   travelling but not getting anywhere    each time i awoke in a sweat   terrified    you don t have to be carl jung to understand that dream    powerless to make changes   trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue   this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake    this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after   battlefield earth   begins    for all of its flash and style   l   ron hubbard s science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000    dull   and   stupid    in the year 3000   the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1   000 years    humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians    there s no hope    the future is bleak    then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler   barry pepper   who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl   john travolta   and the alien race    it s an archetypal post apocalyptic plot full of promise    considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen   it s difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably    but it does    the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits    are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold   the psychlo never discovered fort knox    or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time    and gassed up    or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships    or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don t notice that their slaves are missing for days    travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he s worth and is almost entertaining    almost    the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person      man animal   or not    would ever utter    some of the film  looks  good   but it also looks so familiar    a race of large hulking ape like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin    sound like something charlton heston might be in    the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from   dune      the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with    it s too loud    it s too oppressive    it s too slow    it s too long       far  too long    and on it goes    the list of the problems with   battlefield earth   is endless    it s difficult to find anything in the film that does work    oh yeah    the color scheme is nice    the real question is how this movie ever got made    could it have something to do with the fact that l   ron hubbard was the founder of scientology    and that john travolta is a member of the church    that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago    but it doesn t give us a clue as to why first time screenwriter corey mandell s atrocious script was used    or why the high profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film    or why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems    the one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costner s   the postman     which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure   be   the   big budget science fiction failure       battlefield earth   has the honor sewed up    often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video    that s not the case here    you can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one    don t hesitate    strike now while the iron is cold    
Neg, capsule   one of the ten worst movies ever made    christopher lambert vs   evil ninjas in modern day japan        and nobody wins    the hunted is such a bad movie   so completely inept and so totally brain damaged that i could almost feel affection for it    i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it   if it weren t also insanely xenophobic and insulting    christopher lambert plays a computer parts salesman who s on business in japan    he meets a slinky young woman   joan chen   and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her    and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader   john lone      apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered    since lambert is a witness   he s of course the next one to die    let s stop and think about this for a second    if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society   he d have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock    in this movie   the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him    i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body    you know what a goof field is   that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is    this is   of course   only the beginning of the movie s problems    lambert eventually finds pseudo safety with a long haired modern day samurai   yoshio harada   and his partner    yoko shimada   who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun    they are the two best things in the movie   in every scene they have authority and presence   and they actually look like they belong here   even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows    the script doesn t know what the hell to do with them    lone   as the bad guy   is zero dimensional    the only bad guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him    in the hunted   this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype    what s funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes    there s a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver   and a girl in a pachinko parlor    but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful    also   the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack    get the cd    that manages to survive despite the drek it s been designed to accompany    there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing    a gory   excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment   and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re couple the whole thing with the movie s relentlessly stupid plot    by the time we get to the final showdown   with lambert getting to wield his own sword   which   judging from the ham handed editing of one scene   was forged in seven hours or so     we no longer care    we re not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies !  someone once said that the key to good art    good movies   good books   whatever    is to start somewhere interesting   end up somewhere interesting   and show respect for the audience all along the way    this movie bungles two out of three   badly    
Pos, city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most   thought provoking   moving   and completely unsentimental    i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant   which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality    city of angels is a wonderful film   enhanced by interesting and well rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years    it s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story   and avoids most of the cliches we re so used to seeing in films like this    city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders  1988 film wings of desire    i have yet to see wings of desire   so i am   unfortunately   unable to make a comparison of the two    i have heard   however   that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways   which makes me glad that this film isn t a rip off of its source material    nicolas cage stars as seth   an angel who   like all of his angel counterparts   is present to lead the dying to heaven   or somewhere just like it      one day   he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr   maggie rice   meg ryan     and his attention is called to her    the angels can make themselves seen to humans   but they can t experience any of the senses   most importantly   touch      he shows himself to maggie   and she falls for him   unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status    seth wants to become human so he can feel her    that s when he meets nathaniel messinger   dennis franz       former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race         as a side note   i found messinger to be the most fascinating character   for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death      messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human    seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel   i know   it sounds ridiculous   but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well done     after much deliberation   she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel    this   of course   is when seth decides to take the plunge   literally   from a building   when he wakes up from the fall   he is human   and happy to feel what it s like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead    since i love this film so much   i ll make a minor note that it certainly isn t perfect    although it is original and mesmerizing   it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre    the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic   though the details are what make the story excellent   and steel has done a great job with them      the ending   too   could have been more powerful and less predictable    these elements are minor   though   and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels    the acting is superb from everyone involved    this is perhaps my second favorite performance from cage   my favorite being the rock      he s quiet and pensive   and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly toned words    he s perfect for a role like this   and at the same time he reassures us he s not bound by playing the psycho   though he is good at it   as he shows in face/off      meg ryan is a powerful   enticing   and appealingly chirpy actress   and her work here is some of her best    dennis franz   however   steals all of his scenes as the energetic former angel    what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation    director brad silberling is a talented man   and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters   rather than forced sentimentality    his direction is steady   and he shows this in just about every scene   near the beginning   maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead    there is no music or elaborate camera work   we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information    this is the way stories should be told   and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real    the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do    cinematographer john seale   the english patient   provides some of the most stunning images i ve seen on the big screen   hundreds of black clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours   just as an example      the music   by gabriel yared   also of the english patient     is perfect for this film   it s quiet and moody music   but not sentimental !     and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely    the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far    all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre    it s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across  the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously    
Neg, darren   jason biggs     wayne   steve zahn     and j   d     jack black   have been best friends since the fifth grade    like the three musketeers   they ve been together through thick and thin    but   when darren meets an attractive   but cold blooded and manipulative   psychiatrist   judith   amanda peet     the long time friendship is placed in danger    it s up to wayne and j   d   to rescue their best friend in   saving silverman         silverman   has its heart in the right place   but the story   by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul   is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren s soul    based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake   the story is centered on the three   life long amigos    when wayne introduces darren to judith   he doesn t realize that he has opened a pandora s box of disaster for himself and j   d   judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match    since then   she has sought a new mate   someone she can boss around and mold into her own vision    enter darren silverman    once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement   wayne and j   d   try everything they can   including threats and bribery   to get judith to free darren    nothing works until the duo come up with a plan   kidnap judith and get darren back together with the girl he called his one and only   pretty sandy perkus   amanda detmer      the only problem here is that sandy is about to take her vows to become a nun    things spiral out of control as judith repeatedly attempts to escape while wayne and j   d   play cupid    the boys even bring their idol   neil diamond   into the picture to help resolve things    thinking about it   this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black    the pair is able to elicit the film s only laughs with their goofy antics and child like behavior    they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task    steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne   the   brains   of the gang    jack black has the big guy moves of a chris farley   giving j   d   an amusing physical presence    the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material    the rest of the cast doesn t fare as well   though    jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do   though having watched his previous films     american pie   and   loser     i m not sure what attraction biggs actually has    amanda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith    there is no humanity at all to her character as she single mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind s image    she s a monster that wayne and j   d   must defeat to save their friend    unfortunately   there is no dimension to her character    amanda detmer brings nothing   or gets nothing   as darren s one and only    r   lee ermey   as the psychotic coach   made a bad decision taking this role    tune meister neil diamond gives a good natured cameo perf as the boys  idol and savior    production values are on par with the rest of the film   lackluster and non involving    director dennis dugan has a track record for broad comedy with films like   big daddy   and   beverly hills ninja     but falls flat with   saving silverman      the 2001 movie year has yet to provide us with a   good   film to sink our teeth into    at least   with   saving silverman     we get a couple of funny perfs from zahn and black    too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor    kick boxing deaths and conflicted nuns are not the makings of a good comedy    i give it a c     
Neg, depending on your degree of cinematic acumen   last man standing is either a   a prohibition era remake of akira kurosawa s 1961 classic yojimbo   b   a prohibition era remake of sergio leone s 1964 classic a fistful of dollars   c   a prohibition era action drama with a completely original story line    new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category   c   than in the other two combined   much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons    the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing   which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the  real  source material   the dashiell hammett novel  red harvest     it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself    this time around   the man with no name is played by bruce willis   a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico    by all appearances   jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town   with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border    one is headed by an irishman named doyle   david patrick kelly     the other is run by chicago connected italian mobster strozzi   ned eisenberg      calling himself john smith   the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict   and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle s side    but smith s allegiance is as uncertain as his name   and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them    viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint   and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes cum bastardizations    there is the happily ineffectual lawman   bruce dern     the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses  affections   karina lombard     the barkeep who becomes our anti hero s only friend   william sanderson     suspicious lieutenants   christopher walken and michael imperioli   to question the bosses  trust in smith   a brutal beating   and a big fire    director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids   including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity   but at least he doesn t try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture    what he  does  do is nearly as big a mistake   and that is to provide a running voice over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard boiled style of pulp detective fiction    yes   that narration is full of cliches   but those are are not particularly troubling    the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters    they were a mystery   to the other characters in the film and to the audience   their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted   and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status    with john smith s voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought   he becomes more mundane   just another tough guy trying to stay alive    it feels like a hammett novel   all right   and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice   but it simply doesn t work    the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence   and the man with no name takes  no one  into his confidence    even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate   i can t imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction    willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith   but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else    christopher walken plays doyle s brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft spoken psychos   and there isn t another single character whom makes even the slightest impression    with no compelling antagonist for smith   there is no build up towards the expected showdown   and when it does come   that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about    cinematographer lloyd ahern   who also did the only noteworthy work on hill s 1995 flop wild bill   creates some nifty sunburned vistas   but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter productive narration    sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original   they ll wonder what all the talk was about    in the case of last man standing   it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about    
Neg, how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres    isn t there a law or something    this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg s dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst    mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison    writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill    the plot   for what its worth   concerns two brothers   nathan lane and an appalling lee evens   who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father    deciding to check out the long abandoned house   they soon learn that it s worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder    but battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse   happy with his run down little abode and wanting it to stay that way    the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe    whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue   terrible overacting   and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury   signifying nothing    the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is     i hate that mouse      oh cringe !  this is home alone all over again   and ten times worse    one touching scene early on is worth mentioning    we follow the mouse through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in a wall    he jumps into a tiny bed   pulls up a makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep   seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone    it s a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film    a message to speilberg   if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility   then either give all concerned in mouse hunt a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent writers and directors    this kind of rubbish will just not do at all    
Neg, i can imagine how good krippendorf s tribe must have looked on paper    it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors   led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director   todd holland     all wanted to make this film    in fact   it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf s tribe as possible    in retrospect   i can imagine how bad this film could have been    i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss    dreyfuss plays james krippendorf   an anthropologist who is granted $100   000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea    halfway into his two year expedition   his wife   apparently   dies    i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established    later   we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big screen tvs and other such pleasures    so   when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely   he decides to construct an elaborate lie    he makes his own tribe   using his three children as actors in a video    he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe   which he calls the shelmickedmu      audiences at krippendorf s lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision    and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community    like all films like this   the lie becomes more and more complex   and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero    dreyfuss is a funny   talented man   and he is funny in this film    he has lots of positive energy and   unlike most comical actors   really manages to play people like this realistically    this film also requires a lot of physical humor that i ve never seen dreyfuss perform   and he does a great job    jenna elfman   who plays veronica mecilli   a scientist who wants in on krippendorf s work   is also very funny and appealing here    and the kid actors are great   as well    but we re talking about the script from hell    this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen    but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it    all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew    no   the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched    furthermore   the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless    take   for instance   the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex    they get all decked out in the tribe getup   complete with paint to darken their skin    krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe    now   i saw this scene coming from a mile away   but i said to myself     no   that would be far too tasteless    there s no way they ll do that       oh  god !    they did do it    it s there    i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn t bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film    i found it deplorable    and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it   he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice    the film is filled with scenes like these    they not only insult the audience   but they insult the types of people that the film portrays    it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists   yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon    and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining   but i think that most members of the on screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes    if i were an anthropologist   this film would insult me immensely    moving right along   the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes    sure   dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny   and it allows for some entertaining scenes   but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes    it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film    his character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar   and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does    i suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case   but for the purposes of good taste   i would have expected something    no   this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues   and the writer of the film   charlie peters   didn t include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad    in fact   it s his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing   and he continually shrugs off her warnings    i suppose it s important to admit that this is a funny film    dreyfuss and elfman   and many of the contrived and insulting scenes   add up to a picture that is anything but boring    and if you re less serious than i   you probably will enjoy it    i   however   can t get past these elements    krippendorf s tribe is being marketed as a family comedy   but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn t be learning    with a little more insight into its story and themes   this could have been a good movie    
Neg, i ll bet right now you re just lounging by the pool   humming   i will always love you   and wistfully recalling your candlelight dinners with success    it isn t necessarily over for you   i say you still have enough charm that you could avoid starring in   kevin !    for at least a few more years    begin by scribbling   the star that burns twice as bright burns half as long   somewhere you ll always see it   perhaps on the fridge door   or on a bedroom mirror with lipstick    you had a heck of a thing going there until you agreed to star in robin hood   prince of thieves   where you were not only upstaged by powerhouses morgan freeman and alan rickman   but christian slater   !     several dozen tall trees   bows   arrows   and a canoe   too    after dances with wolves and jfk   you decided the world needed more three hour movies   expensive three hour movies   so you starred in and produced wyatt earp   wyatt earp the man was a boring idiot who made the history books solely due to a general lack of famous wyatts    wyatt earp was so dull a cowboy that he died of natural causes    tombstone was a vastly superior movie based on the same legend   and that featured kurt russell as earp and dana delaney as his girlfriend !     she was played by joanna going in your movie you know   the character known best in wyatt earp as   jew whore      what were you and lawrence kasdan thinking      now   you re suffering the demise of yet another of your epics   the postman   a film so financially disastrous that it all but eradicated the memory waterworld s and tin cup s mildly lucrative box office takes    the postman is not the worst movie ever made people in hollywood are quick to forget movies like howard the duck whenever the next bomb comes along    yet it is a ridiculous movie    i suspect you thought you had another braveheart on your hands why else line up two armies on horesback   all prepared for battle   for the climax of your film    but     mailheart   the postman is not       i can think of some more appropriate alternate titles   post encounters of the worst kind   farewell   my salary   howard the postman   the postman s never watched twice          what a brown movie    i hate brown    you love brown    dances with wolves was golden and brown it looked like an eggo commercial    the postman had me running for a glass of water every two minutes   would the post apocalyptic world look this maddeningly bland and dry    what exactly happened to this desert world   anyway    did we all become so stupid that we didn t immediately begin rebuilding homes   restaurants   and most importantly   shopping malls   after   the war      why did you choose to drive the movie s plot with a dumb group of terrorists who   well   terrorize townfolk across america    why is it only * they * have ammunition   anyway    was it really appropriate to cast your daughter as a girl who has a sweet crush on you   the drifter cum postman    why cast english actress olivia williams as an american    don t you realize that european women can only deliver their big emotional scenes in their native accent       take a look at the less than stellar performances of an american ized nicole kidman or an american ized minnie driver      who could give a damn whether you lived or died at the end of this movie    if it came down to a fight for leadership between you and the leader of the terrorists   why didn t you do that halfway through the film and save us all a lot of headaches    why cast will patton as the bad guy    because you worked with him in no way out    sure   he s a suitably creepy villain   know why    because he s creepy in everything   including armageddon   in which he plays a heroic astronaut who practically slithers into his space suit !  why heroize the most demonic institution in america   the u   s   postal system    was tom petty supposed to be playing tom petty    if so   why didn t he look more skeletal       he should have been around 70 years old      why   oh why   do i have so many questions       i could ask plenty more      shouldn t a three hour running time have provided you enough space to answer everything    you have one great line in this film   and you deliver it to a mule !       the things i like about my ass          i had to wonder    actually   i enjoyed the tone of the opening scenes   a relaxed cynicism   if you ll accept such clunky phrasing too bad you couldn t resist the temptation to film yet another love letter to your country    ultimately   i m saying relax    there is no quota   no need for you to make a picture a year    settle down    really question future screenplays before you commit to them    feel free to write back    i know how much you like letters    
Neg, nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink and a concussive nudge bombast o rama con air    the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe   a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill fated bar room brawl    the prison scenes are accompanied by voice overs in which poe   in a languid southern drawl   describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met    if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity   it probably should    cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim witted and ridiculous   and that he s going to have to do something to keep himself entertained    and thus he slips into a familiar   surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings    cage plays cameron poe as a buffed up version of raising arizona s h   i   mcdonnough    cage should have known what he was getting himself into    he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock   and if there s one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production   even without his late partner don simpson     it s that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the  last  bruckheimer production    the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage s performance    in the rock   cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time    that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self awareness    while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home   cage s goal is different but just as simple   to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact    audiences   too   should know what they re getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production    in fact   the marketing people are counting on it    no one who loathed the rock for its swear grunt blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air   no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded    director simon west   yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab s soda fountain   delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture   it s perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma   like insulin   con air does the work of a gland      what he doesn t deliver is a moment of suspense    a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock s notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk   a really    really  big desk and a really    really  big bomb will serve the purpose nicely    if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension   they might have done something with con air s creepiest set up    at a desert stop for the plane load of convicts   serial killer garland greene   steve buscemi   wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool    their tete a tete is eerie and menacing   providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains   danny trejo   ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them      in fact   con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement    too many characters   too much editing   too many dopey punch lines   too much of the cheap   ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts    it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance    while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack   as a u   s   marshal   goes for earnest   cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep    his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape   his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies    it doesn t bode well for cage s appearance in face/off later this month   perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over    there s a word for people like you   nicolas    that word is called recidivist       repeat  offender    
Pos, one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel    that concept   although many purists doubt its scientific credentials   spawned many interesting novels   comic books and films in the last century    however   the big grand daddy of time travels   h   g   wells  novel the time machine   wasn t written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences    the author   h   g   wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich   idle capitalist class and impoverished labour    whatever intentions wells had   the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages    instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space    the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration    first of them was george pal   who in 1960 directed film which would   through the years   become genre classic of its own    the plot revolves about george   rod taylor     victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension   time    at the eve of the new 20th century   george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention   machine that would enable him to travel through time    they are skeptical   but that doesn t prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future    at first   he travels slowly   seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars    finally   after witnessing world war three   he travels far into the future   hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions    when he finally reaches year 802   701 ad   at first glance   new world looks like utopia   humanity consists of young   beautiful   but idle eloi   people who are fed   clothed and taken care of by unseen machines    but   weena   yvette mimieux     eloi woman   tells george about another side of the coin   in the night   her people is preyed upon by morlocs   humanoid creatures from the underworld    the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature   the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times    for h   g   wells it was frightening threat of class struggle   for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan   who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war   it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust   underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie    even the modern audience   which would be tempted to discard the film as old fashioned   could find some values in its universal messages   fit for each era    compared with the genre films of today   the time machine is even better   and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent   thought provoking films    of course   since this is hollywood product after all   the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure   sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness    for example   it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future   same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters   while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today    some of the final scenes   that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero   are also rather unconvincing    but   on the other hand   the film is very well directed   cleverly paced and the special effects   although definitely old fashioned   are more than adequate for this kind of picture    the acting is good   with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles   while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george s trusted friend filby    yvette mimieux   who plays weena   on the other hand   would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role    however   despite all those flaws   the time machine is a very good piece of cinema   something that connoisseurs of quality science fiction films sorely miss these days    
Neg, spoiled rich kid kelley morse   chris klein   receives a new mercedes for a graduation present    he and his buddies take it for a joyride to a small nearby town   where he proceeds to torment the locals simply because he s rich and they re not    he ends up provoking jasper   josh hartnett   into a race and as a result   the local gas station and diner are destroyed when they crash into it    kelley is sentenced to rebuild the diner   and has to live with jasper in a spare room over his family s barn    jasper s girlfriend sam   leelee sobieski   soon takes a liking to kelley however   despite the fact that 1   it was her family s diner that was destroyed and b   all kelley does is sit around   sulk   and smart off to the townspeople    but when she sees him sweaty and shirtless   that s apparently all she needs to lose her feelings for jasper   whose only fault seems to be a perpetual case of hat hair      so sobieski soon falls in love with kelley   especially after the day she follows him through the woods and hears him giving his graduation speech   which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people      in the speech   kelley quotes a poem by robert frost   which just so happens to be sam s favorite poem as well    awwwww    soon they re frolicking around in the fields and for some reason waste no time letting people in town   especially jasper s best friend   see them together    kelley continues to make an ass of himself in town   especially when he shows up at the town dance   drunk and steaming because sam went with jasper    kelley runs off and decides to leave town    sam catches up to him at the bus station and he asks her to come to boston with him    jasper shows up and tearfully confesses to sam just how much he loves her   and sam   without even breaking stride basically says   see ya !    and takes off to boston with kelley    here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start that by the time its fairly decent ending comes around   its completely worthless    chris klein and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers   and it s because of their presence that i watched this film in the first place    however   not long into the proceedings i wanted to just reach into the film and strangle them both    i shouldn t have such feelings towards people i like   but their characters are so infuriating that        well trust me   you ll feel the same way    even though both of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong   kelley is hands down the more unlikable of the two   simply because his jerkish actions are calculated    he intends to be a jackass each and every time he does it    jasper on the other hand   only reacts to kelley s provocations   and afterwards comes across as being truly sorry for his impulsive actions    but   as in life   nice guys finish last    for the entire film we watch sam fall in love with the guy no one likes while the film s only sympathetic character gets completely crushed    then   a cancer subplot comes into play   where things get even more infuriating   if you can imagine that      what   things weren t depressing enough for you mr   screenwriter    who greenlit this project    who   on earth   thought this would entertain anyone    perhaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people    but even after he s destroyed these people s lives he continues to be a snob to them   and ruins one more for good measure    here on earth is available on dvd from fox home entertainment    it contains the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1   85   1 and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions    extras include jessica simpson s music video for   where you are     a commercial for the film s soundtrack   which by the way is the only good thing about the film     the original theatrical trailer and five tv spots   trailers for other fox releases   anna and the king   anywhere but here   the beach   drive me crazy   ever after   romeo + juliet   simply irresistible     as well as that new fox promo touting their upcoming dvd releases that i really enjoy    the picture and sound quality on the disc are fine        nothing that will challenge anyone s audio/video systems of course    fans of this movie   if any exist   should enjoy the dvd release    here on earth is not entertaining nor is it compelling    no joy or entertainment value can be derived from any of the events of the film    it is merely a waste of time   money and talent    
Neg, the premise of the new james wong film   final destination   is that alex browning   the protagonist   prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane   thereby cheating fate    however   fate is not so easily bested   and alex s friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances    essentially   this premise is a clever way to make a slasher flick without the slasher    unfortunately   this is practically the only clever thing about the film    as far as teen horror flicks go   final destination is better than many    there is enough shocking death   graphic gore   and requisite black humor to provide the essential   roller coaster   type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick    unfortunately   this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre    the relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set up the next death    the scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed    if you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date   this film might do the trick    other than that   wait until it goes into heavy rotation on cable    
Neg, the year is barely a week old   and there is already a candidate for the worst of 1997  the relic   a would be chiller that s more successful at making the audience laugh than scream    in this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams   whose last two pictures were dreadful jean claude van damme vehicles     a creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses   hypothalamii     of humans and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum    how did this creature come into existence   and why does it feed on hormones    the   scientific   explanation cooked up by the four  yes   four  credited screenwriters   amy holden jones   john raffo   rick jaffa   and amanda silver   takes   suspension of disbelief   to new heights   even by monster movie standards    but as cockamamie as the science is in the film   it isn t quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics    miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination   turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip   complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears    give it up   penelope  it s a  monster movie     on the flip side   tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant   but his role is so thankless that it s hard to imagine it being played any more effectively    it s quite funny to see a film indulge   with the straightest of faces   in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well   and so recently   in scream    for example   in one early scene   a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night    ok   we all know what s coming   but as if we didn t need any more confirmation   he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away    everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie    and later   miller frantically runs out of a museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing    does she make a beeline for the front door    of course not  she runs into the ladies room and cowers in a stall    with all the cliches   it is only fitting the film s climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film   that of someone outrunning a fireball    if the relic is truly   the next evolution in terror   as the poster states   then the horror film  and humanity  is in even worse shape than we thought    
Neg, this is the worst movie i ve seen since the   so bad i walked out on it     jingle all the way      it is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap    it is crap through and through    nothing works in this film   as to be expected from joel schumacher   who has made only one watchable film in his entire career   that being   cousins        here s a man who admits he s a medicore director   a rather charmingly self effacing statement    but truth be told   he is much worse than mediocre    not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though    akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again    there is no plot anywhere   and the   dialogue   is unrelentingly shallow   preposterous   and boring    they set up mr   freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife   then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one liners    it turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death    but that s par for course    nothing in this film makes any sense   including half of arnold schwarzenegger s lines    as mr   freeze   arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once    this is the same problem he had in   jingle all the way     and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass    personally   i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn t retake scenes to make him understandable    compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in   batman & robin      apparently   james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold    uma thurman is not as bad   but nothing resembling good either    her poison ivy vamps around terribly   chewing up scenery left and right    and her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub snl standard   acting     as if she s reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment    given the   script     it s a wonder it didn t happen more frequently    there is no redeeming feature in this film    not george clooney as batman   chris o donnell as robin   nor alicia silverstone as batgirl    michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred   as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance    in fact   there was something unsettling about his appearance   which seems to have been accomplished without any make up tricks   looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man    unfortunately   every scene about alfred s sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance    they just go through the motions   losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart    the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle    you know there s a bunch of people   but instead of a melee   schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist    there s never a moment of awe   wonder   or mayhem    the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects   which are impressive   and probably expensive      even then   the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable    the hockey team from hell    not even the tv series got that stupid   at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that   batman & robin   showcases      frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do    blink   and you ll miss elle macpherson as julie madison   vivica fox as a   why is she even in the film   vamp in freeze s lair   with all of two lines     and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had    and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs   vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs   fries    she isn t even filmed well enough to look good   trust me   she s quite attractive outside of this dreck      and as if the film weren t bad enough to limp along with bad direction   bad dialogue   bad performances   and bad fight scenes   there are inconsistencies and illogic galore    i know it s nit picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs   why the character s arms aren t ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a one armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet   while holding on to another person no less     or where the moisture comes from when freeze s weapon creates tons if ice    that s all traditional comic book stuff    but why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by standers    why is there a big switch clearly marked     heat   in mr   freeze s lair    why do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr   freeze hand to hand    why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her    why do batman & robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency    and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones   why don t they wear masks to filter it out    i could go on and on       batman & robin   is a braindead   pointless   garish   loud film that should still reign as the   worst film of the year   by the time 1998 rolls along    note to warner bros      if you re going to make another batman film   please replace schumacher with nearly anyone    because it could actually get worse than this    what schumacher does not understand is that   comic book   doesn t automatically equal unbearable idiocy    the true equation seems to be schumacher + batman = unbearable idiocy    
Pos, towards the middle of   the sweet hereafter     a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend   careens through the steel guard rail   and disappears out of sight    then   in long shot   we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow covered field    it pauses for a moment before the   field   cracks under the bus  weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment   a single smooth second of time    compare that scene   if you will   to the last eighty minutes of   titanic     when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise   and you ll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films    the scene in   the sweet hereafter   epitomizes all that s right with independent canadian director atom egoyan s film    it s not sensational    we don t see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming   terrified children being bloodied and battered about    the bus doesn t explode or break into a thousand tiny pieces    it simply leaves the road and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake    it s a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm and distance    using a non linear approach to his narrative   egoyan shifts back and forward in time   connecting us with the inhabitants of the small british columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy    fourteen children died in the accident   leaving their parents and the town itself paralyzed with grief    the catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens   a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm     who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit    stephens   who   doesn t believe in accidents     functions as a concerned   involved observer   scribbling details in his notebook and providing the parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath    while stephens  initial drive may be financial   one third of the total settlement if he wins     his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come to grips with his own loss    his self destructive   drug addicted daughter has been in and out of clinics   halfway houses and detox units for years    egoyan s attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry    mychael danna   who composed the shimmering music for   the ice storm     contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles    equally impressive is paul sarossy s cinematography   capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides and low hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors  in one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room       the sweet hereafter     while undeniably grim   urges the viewer to grab onto life with both hands and not let go    it s a film of generous subtlety and emotion    
Pos, upon taking a seat at the theater   and surveying the crowd   i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises    i m twenty two   but have been accused of looking sixteen    yet as the film began   any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close knit   yet troubled sisters    director pat o connor   inventing the abbots   circle of friends   weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss   need   and the bonds between five sisters    the family is ruled by kate   meryl streep     an unconsciously strict schoolteacher   who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family    there is very little background given to the viewer   as we are thrust into a tense but loving home    squabbles take place one after the other   caused by years and years of history    perhaps one of the best things about this film   is its naturalness    no situation is over wrought   and characters react as real people do   to real problems    this probably is a result of the film being from a stage play    the play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright    what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples   both in lughnasa and africa    in fact   dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness    legs tap   and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster    only after the music stops   and the characters stand breathing heavily do we sense any trouble    in the quiet after the music we muse that it s sad that music has to cease   and families falter    the movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy   the narrator of the movie   as a young child flying a kite    he trips over a bump and loses hold of his string   and the kite floats off farther into the distance    drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained   and at another glance mischievous    the mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite   and kate s hold of the family isn t strong enough to hold off the winds of change    as michael stands   staring at his kite fly away   we hear the adult michael   looking back at the season that his world changed forever    the movie is not overpowering   but it gives us a beautiful window into the life   love   and trouble of a household of lonely women    note   this is the first movie review i ve ever written   any responses on it would be greatly appreciated          
Pos, urban legend surprised me    based on the last few films the genre has produced   including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer   disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween   h20     i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena    thankfully   legend rose above it s soggy premise to become not only a hip   scary and stylish entertainment   but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year    you re all familiar with the plot   a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who s identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be   you guessed it   everybody s favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks       the  only person you didn t suspect !  however   just because legend doesn t really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can t qualify as first class entertainment    it was   believe it or not   one of the funnest times i ve had at the movies all year    the thing is   i m not really sure what made this particular stab   pardon the pun   at the genre seem so fresh and alive    maybe it was the above par performances by the movie s two leads   jared leto and   cybil   actress alicia witt      or   it could have been the on  target direction by jamie blanks    more likely   though   it was because of the inspired premise    i don t think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman    urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener   not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film    a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when   gasp !   a gas problem   hee hee   forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill    one problem   though    would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif    i thought not    predictably   the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company    it s odd   though   when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody s on the other line    naturally   the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off    and the when we least expect it       whack ! ! !  a decapitation    it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car    so who is it this time    the obvious candidate is the slightly off kilter professor at the college the girl went to   none other than freddy kruger himself   robert englund     who teaches a class on urban legends    a ha    or could it be the fame hungry local journalist   leto   looking for a meaty story to put on his resume    like all movies of this nature   one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit    and it turns out to be   of course   the one you didn t suspect    i m not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is   but i must give credit where credit is due    and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been       fun     * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi   ca  
Pos, warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest   craziest and hard hitting movie in his career    based on a story concocted by himself   and also written by beatty   bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system    beatty stars as senator jay bulworth   who s going through a nervous breakdown    after hiring someone to kill him   he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what s  really  happening in american politics   much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy   platt      instead of everyone hating him   the american public love him    however   inside his party   more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin    and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina   berry      it s remarkable that this film was released at all    much more open than the rather subdued primary colours   bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name    the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny   and also somewhat true    it s great that beatty isn t afraid to let loose on a subject    talking of beatty   he s excellent in the role of the demented senator   clearing having fun    and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed    even in dick tracy   he was the most straighten face actor       then again   he was the only characters face we could completely see      the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping   which he does with gusto   and also quite well      and seeing beatty as a  homeboy  has to be seen to be believed    it s nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself    second best is oliver platt as the flustered   coke snorting assistant   who goes over the top when he finally snaps    halle berry is fine   and sexy   as the intellectual nina   who comes to like the senator    also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent   laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she s also played   and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife   who all contribute to the fun    and   this being a political film   the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance   as   * shock *   himself    the writing and directing   both by beatty   are above par    the direction is very nearly sitcom like   but suits the film perfectly   and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well    the script is funny   and the raps are actually well produced and humorous   and quite clever    they re not cringe inducing   at least    the script makes many points about society in america today   and isn t afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system    best of all   the film is thought provoking   but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather   and is very entertaining    there s also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes    bulworth is a film with many advantages   and few flaws    perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping   but beatty does it so well it s irrelevant    in fact   there s very little against bulworth   except for the language which is very heavy   but then again it should be expected    bulworth   then   is well worth watching    a david wilcock review   1999     you know   for kids     norville barnes  
Pos, we all know the fate of   child s play     which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially   sequel hell    with the newest installment in the quasi popular series currently out   that would be   bride of chucky     and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend   which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five     it s kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original   a task which is a retread for some   and for others   namely myself   a chance to see what all the fuss was about    alas   the original   child s play   actually isn t that bad    even seeing it in the tiny   claustrophobic   and mechanically challenged theatre at my college wasn t the horribly dull experience i thought it would be   not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd   which you almost need to watch a film like this   and if you don t believe me   try and watch this flick by yourself one day     but because as a whole   this isn t a bad movie    it s not great   but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don t have   1   a rather nifty premise   and 2   a sense of humor   both which save this from horror hell   which is precisely where   say     i know what you did last summer   has recently gone    the premise of   child s play   is that a serial killer named charles lee ray   brad douriff   is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard boiled detective   chris surrandon   see what happens to some oscar nominees       and before he dies   utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid s doll called chucky   a doll which has got to be the scariest looking kid s doll i ve ever seen    the next day   a bum who s stolen it sells it to single mother karen barclay   catherine hicks     who then gives it to her young son andy   alex vincent   for his birthday    of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll   but certain twists come up    like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll   that being andy    and soon enough   chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun   and people are discovering that chucky isn t just a kiddie doll one by one    the idea is a neat one   ripe for lots of comic terror   and luckily it utlizes a lot of that    it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive   they tell people about it   but when he tries to prove themselves   chucky does nothing   and everyone thinks they re crazy    it plays with this   as well as the whole child like thought that dolls and toys come to life   and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments    even if there s an entire sequence devoted to cliches   a woman alone in a house hears a noise   goes to investigate it   and finds nothing   but wait for the kicker a second later !      there s also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat   and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes   leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience    the ending is rather fun   as well   albeit a tad too drawn out   about four different endings   maybe five     and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line up   making them easier to sympathize with    if there s one horrible thing about many horror films   it s that the protagonists are morons who you can t help but shout obscenities at   and for the most part     child s play   steers away from that    and most of all   the chucky character is a good one   not just because he provides instant comic relief   look !  that doll s moving on its own !     but because he s a generally scary character    if there s anything really wrong with   child s play     it s that it s too trite and has too less self esteem    at almost 90 minutes     child s play   features way too less to be a real classic of horror    it throws itself into a simple three act set up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it weren t for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll    if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting   it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism   which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film       which  isn t necessarily a bad thing    as such     child s play   is content to be just the short   typical horror film   but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasi campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short   typical horror film    
Pos, when i first heard that romeo & juliet had been   updated   i shuddered    i thought that yet another of shakespeare s classics had been destroyed    fortunately   i was wrong    baz luhrman has directed an   in your face     and visually stunning piece with this film    it revolves around the two rival families   who in this version each run multi million dollar enterprises    these rival companies/families are the capulet s and the montague s    the younger generation of these two families have formed gangs   who despise one another    as the storylines goes   romeo montague   played by leonardo dicaprio   and juliet capulet   claire danes   meet at a fancy dress party   and it is love at first site    i never believed love at first site was possible until i saw this film   the scene in which romeo s eyes meet juliet s through the fish tank is one of the most memorable    of course   they cannot publicly reveal their love   for their families are arch enemies    so they marry in secret   this is where things begin to go wrong    the story   as with all good shakespeare   ends in tragedy    the cinematography is spectacular to say the least   and the soundtrack provides the perfect atmosphere in which to   lay our scene     as the film says    there is very little to criticise    the performances are convincing   and several of the film s younger stars may find that it provides a launch for their careers    the modernisation of the script is ingenious and clever    despite the well known storyline   this latest version still manages to cause tears among many members of the audience   especially the younger generation     and this is certainly a great credit to the film    
Pos, with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up   loading their guns   kissing each other and uttering what sounds like   rock and roll !       actually   it s   lock and load       you can t help thinking tarantino    and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery   the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie & clyde to natural born killers    but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction   exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run   normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon       inspired by true events      we ve heard that one before   and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated        or so strangely poignant    for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality   who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged    beginning with their final arrest   the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris   luke perry     a policeman   and pam   ashley judd     a factory worker    they fall in love and marry   but pam s increasingly erratic behaviour   going on spending sprees   slashing herself with a knife after an argument   begin to trouble the solid and stable chris    when chris gets sacked   they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up    then   chris begins to rob banks        luke perry accomplishes the not inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer    moustached   with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation   he is perfectly cast as the long suffering husband       it s another of john mcnaughton s coups of casting against type   after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory      but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage   and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness   making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person    if the performance falls short of greatness   however   it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema   whether it s in betty blue   tom & viv or georgia    as in those movies   there s the danger that the performance seems mannered   a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece    judd doesn t entirely avoid this pitfall   but pam s  craziness  is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more  normal  chris    when pam reacts to her father in law s death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones   chris  face is the picture of pained restraint    of course   it s the question of what is  normal  that is asked in normal life    mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity    it is the rational chris that loves guns     shooting is about precision   control     and the  crazy  pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog   who is then called chaos      chaos and you and me        we re a real family     she notes wryly      it is chris  methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber   his well planned disguise as a bearded   roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness      in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery   a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background     buy more      the perfectly respectable consumption crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases   and both of them into desperate situations    it s not a perfect film    some of the dialogue is a touch too banal   perhaps intentionally        the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam s crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film    indeed   as in mcnaughton s seminal film henry   portrait of a serial killer   it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism   the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre   that gives this determinedly unflashy   moving film its great strengths    mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet   coolly  realistic  method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer    the suburbs   with their miles of white fenced houses and identikit malls   take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness    in its very different way   this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick s badlands    while pam shares the yearnings of malick s heroes to escape from ordinary life   chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a  normal life    their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies    but these are dreams defined by   constrained by   and even doomed by   the limitations of the  normal    conventional world    pam s final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs   where wild bushes grow    symbolically the frontier   the outer limits of her society   but also quite literally the end of the road   where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement    the flying inkpot s rating system   * wait for the video     * * a little creaky   but still

Neg, wow   a film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever    i m amazed that someone thought this was a story that must be told on screen    many blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their race    i think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves   and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sex crazed buffoons    even i m offended by it    bill bellamy is a   player   which means he sleeps with a lot of women and lies to them    what a pleasant main character    one day   his friends decide that they want to find out how to be a player    why they decide this   one day   i have no idea    how many years have they been friends and why all of a sudden would they want to learn    anyway   bellamy agrees to teach   and his wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house to house having sex with women    this is the bulk of the film folks   guys riding from house to house   one keeps getting out to have sex   while the others sit in the car    since russell simmons is producer   and since the official title of the film is   def jam s how to be a player     i was ready to be jumping up and down and stomping my feet and beating the person next to me because of the comedy    amazingly   aside from gilbert gottfried s 90 seconds of screen time   there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such a manner    instead of jokes   there s just an endless stream of profanity and naked breasts   and naked breasts aren t so bad   but naked breasts alone don t make a good movie      be sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well    gilbert gottfried s character serves as one in his very brief appearance   asking for explanations as to what is being said    they should have brought him along for the entire film    [r]

Pos,    a private matter   is based on the true story of sherri finkbine and the events in her life during the 1960s    after becoming pregnant   for the fifth time   she learns that some tranquilizers she had taken have seriously deformed her unborn child    she and her husband decide   with the help of her doctor   to have an abortion    but this is the 1960s   and abortion is illegal    her doctor has made arrangements to have the procedure performed withing the law   by claiming that the child is endangering the mother s life    everything is about to work out just fine   until sherri has the uncontrollable urge to talk about her situation with a local reporter    this sets off a media frenzy and immediately sherri is the most hated woman in the world    she and her husband are fired from their jobs   reporters are surrounding their home at all times   and most importantly   no one in the country   and eventually other countries   will perform the abortion    this causes emotion problems for all involved       a private matter   is a fascinating story and it s hard to believe that this only happened 30 years or so ago    it s only flaw is that not once is there ever a satisfactory confrontation with sherri and any of her opponents    one woman passing her on the street telss her to burn in hell   and when sherri appropriately yells back     just tell me what i m supposed to do     the woman has no answer    no one apparently had an answer   they just wanted to control what should have been only the choice of sherri and her husband    this is an important film   telling an important story    it s not just about not wanting another child   it s about not wanting a child who will cause severe changes in their family   none of which could be beneficial    sydney pollack served as executive producer for this made for hbo movie    
Pos,    love is the devil   is a challenging film   munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot   perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist s psyche rather than the artist s lifeline    watching it   i was enthralled with the look of the film   the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre   personalized filter    everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon   the film s subject   looked at it personally    but while i was engrossed   i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film   awakened from my trance by some inner distraction   and began to try and follow what s going on    exactly what was i looking at    watching this film   i wasn t sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous    directed   and written   by john maybury     love is the devil   is stylish masterpiece for the senses    everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing    the camera angles are ferociously askew   and the close ups are uncomfortably too close    the editing is deft   occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds   but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs   or rather   intruders to bacon s world and psyche    as such   there is no real story    i ve not heard much about francis bacon that i didn t read prior to the film   but what i learned was this   he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s   drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like    he was one of the first to really come out of the closet   and in interviews   he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty    as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi   he s like a foppish and self absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero    he lives life the way he wants to live it   to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him    it s as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself     champagne for my real friends   and pain for my sham friends     he says one night at the bar he frequents         love is the devil   chronicles the latter part of his life    bacon   well known in his mid life   awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor    he walks in   unafraid of what he finds   and discovers a thief   george dyer   daniel craig      bacon gives him an offer   if he spends the night with him   he can take anything he wants in the morning    george agrees to this   and off to bed he goes   but ends up staying with him   for whatever reason    the film shows their lives together   at least in reference to one another    while creating bacon s world of friends   like   high art     this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood     the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant    bacon is haughty and bizarre   george is simple and doesn t understand bacon in the least   especially not his paintings    while watching this   that s basically all i thought was there    the film has a hypnotic feel   free of any restraints of form   and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about    once the film is over   it s easier to piece it together    i kept on thinking about this film   wondering what the point to all of it was    someone doesn t merely make a film of all style and no substance at all   and if they do   they do it by accident   but still allow some substance to creep in    thinking about it   i remembered how the two fed off of eachother    i thought about how bacon was a masochist   in love with cruelty   in one scene   he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight   and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer s head splashes across his face   in another scene   he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein s   battleship potemkin       and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain    he drove him over the edge   and for him that was love   even if it wasn t for george    i guess that explains the title    a bit    that s great and all   but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning    i wish it hadn t reduced itself to making some point about humanity   about how love is the most selfish thing in the world   and it is   if you look at it a certain way      or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man s twisted pysche    it s almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man s uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience s throat    that way you don t reduce your film to something it s just not    i can t say i totally enjoyed   love is the devil     though    despite all of the things i respect about this movie   it s still rather uncomfortable to sit through    even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes   the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through   especially after an exhausting first hour    though hypnotic   it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times   as if it were taking advantage of one man s truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it    as such   i respect the way the film looks    it s beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that   along with   what dreams may come   and   dark city     it s the year s most visually stunning film    in fact   if a better script had been forged   i d almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film   complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever    and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi   it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs    i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance    then i would have had something to hold me over even now    
Pos, a couple of months ago   when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net   my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold  yawn     followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key   not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss poor trailer    then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u   s           unique       excellent         must see    well   i thought still skeptical   i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here     here    of course   was still three months away    i ll admit   when i trotted off to see this film   the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow    i d heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled   but his films were definitely not on my must see list    that   let me tell you   has changed completely    i knew this fact only five minutes into the film   after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet    the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick    seriously    i ve never been a big john travolta fan   but he   like cage   perfectly suited his role in the movie           sorry    make that  roles  in the movie    even travolta s great performance   however   paled in comparison to cage s character portrayals    my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler s hideout    half drugged out of his mind   he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son s death from castor s perspective     doesn t it just break your heart     he mutters coldly    now don t go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie   it s not    that s what really makes this movie unique    it s an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters           not a common mix at all    suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though           that s  the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other         and  never hit    several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press  rewind  and watch it over again    the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double sided mirror is just plain brilliant    whilst cage s and travolta s performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies   the lesser characters are just as intriguing    joan allen   who usually sticks to the straight drama movies   plays her part perfectly as archer s long suffering wife    i like the fact that her character didn t end up toting a gun at the end of the movie       it  would have wrecked her potrayal    gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy s mistreated girlfriend           make that * one of * castor troy s mistreated girlfriends    other movies would have used her character as just window dressing       a  sex object   but instead her character is very strong and independent    dominique swain   who plays archer s daughter   also does a nice job   though her character is not as explored as much as allen s or gershon s    faults   well       there were some i have to say    first   the movie s ending   whilst being very good overall   was a bit too drawn out for it s own good    after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can t help but think     geez   are you guys nuclear powered or what        there were certain bits that weren t handled properly   like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform/prison   more explanation here would have been nice    overall   this movie was not perfect    but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect    many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made           i  certainly hope so    
Pos, after the press screening of   moulin rouge     i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues    everyone seemed a bit numb   understandable after sitting through a barrage of often incongruous sounds and images    a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it    another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production   while a woman who flat out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye    when one fellow quietly stated   i ve never really been a fan of musicals     the statement surprised me because   even though the story is told almost completely through song   i didn t think of it as a musical    there is so much going on in   moulin rouge   that   musical   seems too small a term to cover it       moulin rouge   is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o  adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience    australian director baz luhrmann   the man behind   strictly ballroom   and   romeo + juliet     fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork   opulent imagery and songs ranging from   the sound of music   to   smells like teen spirit      sumptuous and beautiful   vulgar and overdone     moulin rogue   travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the   random   setting    oh   and it has a story as well       it was 1899   the summer of love           christian   ewan mcgregor   is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris     to write about truth   beauty   freedom and love     where he encounters a group of bohemians   led by henri de toulouse lautrec   john leguizamo      christian meets satine   nicole kidman     a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue   and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor    at once fragile and vivacious   the dazzling red haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying    christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well   which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession    working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler   jim broadbent     christian writes an opus modestly named   spectacular spectacular      zidler quickly finds a backer   the wealthy duke of monroth   richard roxburgh     but there s a catch   the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine    as if all that isn t enough   satine has a cough   and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold   it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land    like a teeter totter     moulin rogue   moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime    one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night   becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales    together they dance   while serenaded by the man in the moon   alessandro safina provides the vocals     apparently transported from the classic georges m   li   s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky    other scenes merely traffic in everything and the kitchen sink overload    the cavorting of toulouse lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy   accompanied by cartoon sound effects   is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like   bewitched   beat into the ground    of course   sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind       we never heard from baz to turn it down     one of the actors told the los angeles times       it was always    more !  more !      the director even sent a note to his cast reading     i dare you to make me say you ve gone too far      the musical numbers reflect his attitude    one knockout piece   the   elephant love medley     incorporates the beatles    all you need is love     u2 s   in the name of love     dolly parton s   i will always love you   and elton john and bernie taupin s   your song      need more    how about   diamonds are a girl s best friend   spiced with portions of   material girl      luhrmann s cast offers a wide variety of approaches that   together   add up to something messy   but often wonderful    ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian   emphasizing the sincerity of the love struck poet    mcgregor s singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments    once labeled the   ice queen     nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling   yet tender   performance    she handles the songs adroitly   although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range    veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler   wait until you see him perform   like a virgin      as the buffoonish duke   richard roxburgh proves to be the film s weakest link   although i m sure he was simply following instructions    i suspect   moulin rogue   will be one of those love it or hate it films    while i didn t completely love it   i most certainly liked it a lot    over the course of a year   i see well over 300 movies   and most of them look like xeroxes of each other       moulin rogue   is an original   and an original   even a flawed one   is a thing to be cherished    
Pos, albert brooks saves the day   just in the nick of time    with a very poor summer for movies   brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up   and does so in a positive way    while this may not be his finest work     the muse   still shakes up some delightful humor    in albert brook s latest comedy   he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter   brooks   who s losing his edge   as his business partners say    in desperation   he goes to see his friend jack   jeff bridges     who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past    he asks jack for some help   and recieves word of a real life muse   that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career    so brooks seeks the muse named sarah   sharon stone     and is suckered into buying her expensive   food etc   as a sort of payment    the real punch line however   doesn t come until the end    it really makes you wonder   how screenwriters really get their ideas   could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street    the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner    speaking of brooks   he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter    every time he graces the screen   i can t help but start laughing    albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character    the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone    she wasn t likeable at all    brooks had the right idea with her occupation   but she never pulled through    in a way   she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak    luckily brooks could clean up the mess   and cover for stone s mishap    it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance   because   the muse   had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy    on a brighter note   andie macdowell was also charming as brook s wife    she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress   because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she s in    the funniest moments in   the muse   in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese    i mean imagine   brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice   like it was something out of the ordinary    it was just plain hilarious    it just adds to the satire joke   of how directors get ideas    brilliant move by brooks    as i mentioned before   the film is a satire much like it s proceeder bowfinger   which came out a few weeks before    unlike bowfinger   this is not a mean spirited film that s desperate for jokes   it s rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood       bowfinger   had it s moments   but had quite a few problems that were never worked out   but   the muse   still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour    by the end of the film   you re glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it    for once i m not fully disappointed   because the film didn t slow down   it kept moving   even with some flaws    thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort    i think he ll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future    
Pos, at first glance   it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8 year olds    that s true of home alone 2 and i d bet money that it s true of home alone 3   opening soon      but home alone actually has a lot going for it   and the cartoon slapstick doesn t get in the way    the mcalisters   all 15 of them   are going to france for the holidays    four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse    the littlest kid   kevin   is the victim of the older kids  cruelty    kevin s patience runs out when he learns that his plain cheese pizza has already been eaten   and he s going to have to starve    he attacks his big bully brother buzz   who had been teasing him    the fight disrupts the already chaotic dinner   spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table   a few cousins   and an uncle    the knee jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin    nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased   but they all point their fingers when he fights back    the ultimate punishment comes from mom   catherine o hara   who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night    on his way up the stairs   he tells her that   families suck   and that he hopes never to see any of his family again    that night the power goes out   knocking out the alarm clocks   so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport    in a surprisingly plausible setup   kevin is mistakenly accounted for   and the family heads off without him    it s interesting that   in a subtle way   his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children    first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling   and second   they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class    they re two thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child    meanwhile   kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true    he s finally rid of his family !  life is a dream come true    he can jump on the beds   watch r rated movies   eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips   and dig through his big brother s secret box    slowly   the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane    he grooms himself   he does the laundry   he goes shopping     i bought some milk   eggs   and fabric softener        he also starts to miss his family   not just for their company   but for the security they bring    the furnace in the basement is a scary monster   the old man next door is a snow shovel murderer   and two crooks are trying to break into his house    macaulay culkin is cute but he isn t much of an actor    still   we can see that kevin s character grows   thanks to some good direction and editing    for example   acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night   just as   santa   is getting in his car    kevin asks the man to pass on his request   he wants his family back   to the real santa    he learned how to deal with the furnace    you turn on the lights and it s not so scary anymore    he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow shovel murderer   who actually turns out to be a nice man    they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid    finally   in the last 20 minutes   kevin confronts his last fear   the bandits   head on   literally      this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick   and after the movie s genuine dramatic setup   it is dessert    it s a lot of fun   and it doesn t overwhelm the rest of the movie    on the whole   home alone is a great holiday movie    john williams  original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls   and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings    but it does have its flaws    the smallest problem is that culkin doesn t act very well    as i said before   he is cute   but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin s insight into his character    the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda   the villains threaten kevin s life about five times    instead of   i m gonna get that kid   they say   i m gonna kill that kid      some might argue that the tone is the same   but i strongly disagree    mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux pas    i ll probably never see home alone 3   and i wish i had skipped home alone 2   but i do enjoy home alone almost every year    don t let your impressions of the others detract from the original   which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick    
Neg, call it a road trip for the walking wounded    stellan skarsg   rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it s difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly   boozed out presence    yet this ever reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen   a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama    playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets   unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late    that s an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for   focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father   tomas   skarsg   rd   and his alienated   openly hostile yuppie daughter   kaisa   lena headey   gossip      they haven t spoken in years   and wouldn t even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen   scotland by automobile if it weren t for kaisa s mother   charlotte rampling   under the sand   rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer    in a soap opera twist   mother has only a few days to live       only in the movies   right      too blitzed to even step foot on a plane   tomas hits the open road with kaisa    loathing each other all the while   they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out    whenever he isn t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be    despite his sloshed viewpoint   tomas recognizes that the apple hasn t fallen very far from the tree    kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke   sabotages her personal relationships through indifference   and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper    ain t they a pair    unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one note and repetitively bitchy dialogue   screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward    lost money   roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around   nosy cops   and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative    by the time they reach the hospital   it s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father daughter conflict   they re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe    this revelation exists purely for its own sake    aberdeen doesn t know where else to go    weak   unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa    if lena headey were a stronger actress   perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody   haunting cinematography   rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world    the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional      headey s too busy acting   using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance    if she were paying any attention to skarsg   rd   maybe she d figure out that doing less can reveal so much more    it s worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001   jonathan nossiter s captivating signs & wonders    it s not just because skarsg   rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films   they re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen      the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant    in aberdeen   rampling is a luminous diva   preening and static in her hospital bed    despite skarsg   rd s solid performance as tomas   his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow    there s genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders   allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity    nossiter s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain    if signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas   at least it s willing to stretch beyond what we ve come to expect from traditional drama    aberdeen is never half so ambitious   content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies    when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life    the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan s trite but occasionally useful grand canyon   where steve martin s hollywood mogul pronounces     all of life s riddles are answered in the movies !    even foreign films are taking that advice to heart    
Neg, capsule   gal is a 50s ish london cockney gangster who has retired to spain    his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he can t refuse    a standout performance by ben kingsley as don cannot save what is essentially a set of cliches recycled from old westerns       0    4 to +4    roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast     who would have guessed that the most savage mad dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by        ben kingsley      my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark   henry fonda in once upon a time in the west   or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it    they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild   sympathetic   or even ineffectual character roles    the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious    that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast    gary   gal   dove   played by ray winstone   has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain    life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing    but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one two punch    the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa    the second punch comes from gal s past    back in london gang boss teddy bass   ian mcshane   tv s lovejoy   is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal    he sends his most rabid henchman don logan   ben kingsley   to fetch gal    don will accept any decision gal makes from   yes   to   certainly      however   if gal says   no   don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy s ex porn  star wife deedee   amanda redman      in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody s skin    kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness    there are some serious problems in louis mellis s and david scinto s script that should have been caught before filming    when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success    beyond an ability to use skin diving gear   no special talents are required of him    any local hood could have done what gal is needed for    additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault   flooding the vault    no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether   but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool    in spite of the provocative title   the story is cliched and overly familiar    i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade    the story is usually of the reformed outlaw   a robert taylor type   who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability    the old gang   however   wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git   im    it is not a great plot    in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards    perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film    it is an old plot dressed up to look new    if the plot is old   at least the style is creative    this is director jonathan glazer s first film   but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout    his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences    cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes    we see one side of a person s faces    but the other side fades into the darkness   a sort of metaphor for the half world these characters in habit    half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden    we yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog    at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking   the heavy accents   and the cockney language    sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre   the london crime film    the plot may be new to british crime films   but it would be overly familiar as a western    further respectability comes from ben kingsley s high powered performance    i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the  4 to +4 scale    
Pos, elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mid 1500s    it is a time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings    internally   the catholics wage war against the protestants    meanwhile   spain   scotland and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power    little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth   cate blanchett   will be their greatest hope for survival    the film charts elizabeth s tumultuous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom    as a protestant   she is the last person any of the catholic royalty would want to be queen    but her half sister queen mary   kathy burke     deathly ill and unable to conceive a child   pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne    mary gives her her blessing on only one condition   that elizabeth renounce her faith and uphold the teachings of catholicism across the land    once declared queen   elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault   both by her own subjects   including the duke of norfolk   played with steely eyed grace by christopher eccleston   and by forces abroad    slowly but surely   the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns and forges a new path for her kingdom    elizabeth is surrounded by a keenly drawn cadre of subjects and advisers    her closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham   geoffrey rush   in a perfectly subtle performance      also on her side is sir william cecil   sir richard attenborough     her well meaning but misguided chief adviser    with few people she can trust   elizabeth must prove her self worth any way she can   even if it means being the iron fisted ruler she secretly despises    blanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth    she portrays the young queen with just the right balance of gawky self consciousness and shrewd charisma    though not a classical beauty   blanchett is able to entrance the viewer with just a coy smile or an impish smirk    she is at home with her character s playful tendencies   particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend and lover lord robert dudley   joseph fiennes      whether fending off unctuous suitors or   playing   the houses in court   blanchett s elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike    almost as interesting as the character of elizabeth are shekhar kapur s visual delights    he and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted a film with a rich color palette that is a feast for the eyes    rolling green hills   extravagant ceremonial galas   dark and foreboding corridors    all are depicted with a real sense of artistic appreciation    the castles and cathedrals of europe have rarely been doted on so lovingly as they are here    though writer michael hirst s script gets a little murky at times   and his injections of humor get a little overplayed   elizabeth pulses with the right amount of dramatic and cinematic verve to make it just deserving of a theatrical viewing    as a whole   the story survives because elizabeth s struggle is one which deserves attention    by the time she makes her shocking   but very sensible   final declaration   we re ready to bow to elizabeth as our own queen    
Neg, for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones   it is surprising to find the messenger   the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess    in the early to mid 1400 s   there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman    the church was a dismally dark and oppressive place    france was involved in   the hundred years war   against england    there was no strong political leadership in the country    morale was low   there being little hope for the future    it was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing   voices   and seeing   visions      convinced that these were messages from god   she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him    the message   if he would give her an army to command   she would deliver to him the crown    he does        and she does    then   once seated on the throne   he abandons her to her english captors    director luc besson   the fifth element   may have co wrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material    the inconsistencies of the cast   the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes   the inappropriate musical score   and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable    his biggest miscue was to cast his wife   milla jovovich   the fifth element   in the title role    ms   jovovich   looks spectacular as joan   clad in battle armor   astride a similarly protected horse    if looks were enough to fully convey a character   she would have been brilliant    since it isn t   she tried   and failed   to act the part    her joan is unbalanced     inspiring   the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed    john malkovich   being john malkovich   fares a bit better as the dauphin   who joan would see on the throne as charles vii    an easily manipulated man   his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death    faye dunaway   the thomas crown affair   gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin s mother in law and chief advisor    the army under joan s command are comprised of comical figures   more stooges than soldiers    the one exception would be tcheky karyo   la femme nikita   as dunois   the man who was leading the attack prior to joan s arrival    trying to plan a systematic campaign   he sees his leadership authority negated by joan s insistence on following her   visions      dustin hoffman   sphere   has a small inhuman role as joan s conscience which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial    dressed like cloaked monk   he leads her to doubt herself and her   revelations      as well she should    scriptures do speak of revelation    god   via his gift of holy spirit   is able to communicate to men    three of the nine manifestations of holy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation    they are   word of knowledge   word of wisdom   and discerning of spirits    even the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his   holy men        who spake as they were moved by holy spirit   i   e    by revelation        but the scriptures also caution us       beloved   believe not every spirit   but try the spirits whether they are of god   because many false prophets are gone out into the world      1 john 4   1 [kjv]  joan s end     being burned at the stake at the age of 19     the frenzy   mob rule   and blood lust her inspiration wrought   and the death   pain   or suffering which followed her campaign all point to a devilish influence rather than a godly one    while her conviction and intense believing remains an admirable quality   she was   as others have been before and since   misled by the spiritual master of deception    as a messenger   she was quite effective    she was just confused as to whose message she was carrying    
Pos, i m not quite sure what to say about mars attacks !   which is obviously the work of a deranged genius    when tim burton s twisted alien invasion comedy really works   it s breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure    and when it doesn t work   it s just dull    i m not even sure it works more often than it doesn t   but where it counts    that is   when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come    mars attacks !  is brilliant    mars attacks !  is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s   and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer s independence day    old alien invasion flicks   disaster movies   and big budget special effects extravaganzas    but unlike independence day   which was a painfully middle of the road appeal to the hearts   minds and wallets of america   mars attacks !  has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it    the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings   mars attacks !  portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are    the title sequence is just splendid    an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation    the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past   and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman s thundering   theremin driven score is absolutely jaw dropping    it s so overwhelming that   i swear to you   i had trouble breathing    the movie lays low for the next 40 minutes    we get a glimpse of the alien leader   resplendent in a purple sequined cape   when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world    naturally   the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming    but mostly   the first act is spent developing characters   setting up mildly comic situations   and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton    it s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens   because burton s just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars    anyone who comes to mars attacks !  expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed    with few exceptions   these characters are dispatched as the film progresses    jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer   rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr   strangelove s buck turgidson   glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady   and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house s   kennedy room     a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big haired   pointy breasted sexpot   lisa marie   the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood      in an earlier scene   it s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy    sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j   fox is her newsman husband    the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles     they blew up congress !    and plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace    jim brown and tom jones are the film s vegas based heroes   and director barbet schroeder   reversal of fortune   has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president    also on hand and underutilized are annette bening   pierce brosnan   pam grier   lukas haas and natalie portman   the latter two also show up in woody allen s everyone says i love you      the real stars   of course   are the computer generated martians   and they re fantastic    with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull faces   round egg eyes with red pupils darting this way and that   these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate    joe dante s gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory   but burton s little monsters are more inventive    the film s raison d etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind    the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault   easter island is turned into a bowling alley   and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans    the sheer level of mayhem is staggering   especially when the aliens make their first attack   blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons    parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg 13 rating    it s earned    the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy   and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day   although mars attacks !  was in production long before that film s release    cinematographer peter suschitzky   who makes the most of wynn thomas s wildly imaginative production design   thomas helped define the spike lee style     actually took time off from his mars attacks !  regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg    cronenberg s movie will almost certainly be more somber    it won t be released in the u   s   until early next year    but mars attacks !  is surely a similarly elegant nightmare    this is not a nice movie       and which studio executive was duped into giving burton $70 million to make it      by setting the film s final scenes in the nearly empty   holocaust ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided   burton s invasion epic suggests that the world we ve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead    the victims of his invasion are naive   greedy   or disastrously self absorbed    and a good thing   too   since the movie s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish fulfillment fantasy    the surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers   who triumph by determining that the alien invaders    the ultimate elitists    are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture    ultimately   this messy masterpiece is the year s funniest comedy and a weird   winking affirmation of the power of the people    
Pos, if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue   we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia    although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories   mostly in ironic way   like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle s high school reunion     some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones    until that happens   1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed   when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel   materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters    contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times    one of such movies   one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen   is william friedkin s to live and die in l   a    the money isn t just the symbolic motive in the film   it is the major elements of the plot    rick masters   willem dafoe   is an ex convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l   a   being too intelligent to fall into police traps   and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career   masters managed to elude law for years and became well  connected    richard chance   william l   petersen   is a secret service agent   adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters    however   his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another    finally he sets up a final sting   but his superiors deny him the necessary money    being frustrated   and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich   bill pankow     he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier    their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent   but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway    like french connection   one of his previous masterpieces   this friedkin s movie was inspired by real life    gerrald petievich   author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay   spent many years working as a secret service agent    that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency   not much utilised by hollywood    secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed   the beginning scene where the movie s hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan s speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times    ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie    willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath   whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn t seem like affliction in the reagan years   on the contrary   those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable    compared with him   and all the other side characters that want their   piece of the action     two heroes on the side of law seem like losers    instead of being a classical good guy   secret service agent richard chance   portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far   is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement   his sidekick   who should serve as those   better judgement   is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end    in such surroundings of moral decay   the not so happy   yet surprising ending doesn t seem out of line   although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered      the dark atmosphere of l   a     city of glamour and moral decay   is nicely captured by william friedkin s directing skills    the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters   portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro   dean stockwell   debra feuer   darlanne fleugel and steve james   gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece   great car chase    that scene alone   with lot of realism   thrills and surprise twists   is worth seeing the rest of the film    the soundtrack   provided by now almost forgotten band   wang chung     is also one of the more memorable of that decade    in every case   to live and die in l   a   is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it    
Pos, it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an acquired taste    indeed    while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungee jumping   they require no less amount of physical stamina and concentration    i felt rewarded at the end of henry fool   this movie creeps up on you at a slow 139 minutes   i mean creeps and despite the final shot s ambiguity   i left completely satisfied    henry fool     used to have an   e      arrives at garbageman simon grim s house   claims the vacant basement apartment   and almost instantly inspires simon   urbaniak   to take up writing henry   martin donovan look alike ryan   is an ex convict   a once great author who has been   exiled and marginalized   by the publishing community because of his criminal activity    simon s poetry turns him into a local sensation   as it causes mute women to sing   high school girls to swoon   and councilmen to rile against its   pornographic   content    meanwhile   henry seduces both simon s dependent mother   porter   and immature sister   sundance queen posey   with philosophical babble   which is by turns brilliant and inane   and breathy animal lust    these story elements result in climaxes both inevitable and unpredictable   the teacher student relationship formed between henry and simon eventually reverses itself    henry fool is sprinkled with hartley ian flourishes   simon drinks milk from   udderley s     the big teen hang out is called   world of donuts     simon wears his garbageman s uniform throughout   the editing style is decidedly elliptical           which is key to the conclusion s said ambiguity      the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first   self consciously   quirky     the introductory scenes are a chore    these people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion   a belief in themselves   and because they have long term goals   henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner   but they aren t pop slackers    the story is rather classical   the tutor is a better talker than a doer   raised on books   the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of       shades of film school          the finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small   and the final third does test one s patience   yet henry fool is tight   hardly excessive in its length    how refreshing to see a movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character    and unless i nodded off   not a single building exploded    this   hartley s seventh feature   is contemplative about   the artist     fortunately   we never get a sampling of simon s work   and it s a testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers  pens    
Pos, kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue    all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow   and you instantly know what he s thinking       detective story   features one of kirk douglas s finest performances    he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night    the film is based on a play   and this is quite evident   as most of the movie takes place in the one room flat that the detective s work in    the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife   but through a series of events   he never quite makes it there    the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider   a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate    however   this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas s wife   a connection douglas himself is not aware of    many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film    secrets i would not dream of giving away    with a name like   detective story     one would assume the film would resemble an episode of   nypd blue     but it doesn t quite work out that way    however   we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time    lee grant   virtually unrecognizable   plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting    her scenes with bendix   another detective   provide the movie with a few laughs    the performances all around are fantastic    douglas may be the leader of this ensemble   but he s not the center of attention all the time    we get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases    which brings me back to douglas    he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him    we can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime   but has finally realized that what he s really done is gotten back at his criminal father    how he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing    kirk douglas is the kind of actor we don t seem to see to much of these days   he s a tough guy   but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior    
Neg, look ! the new version of   psycho   came out and the world didn t end !  i guess gus van sant really isn t the bringer of the apocalypse !  unfortunately   though   that   psycho   didn t end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it    van sant s controversial   re telling   of alfred hitchcock s classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere   even before it premiered      without benefit of an actual viewing   many have said that the film will   at best   suck    being an   almost   good critic   i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film   at best   sucked   and that concludes the use of the word   suck   and   hopefully   the thoughts that i am a brain dead orangutan      director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it   shot for shot   using the same   exact script   with a few minor alterations      the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary   even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time    suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original    sadly   that did not occur    it is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin   from the original   psycho     but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen    in moore s case   the film would have been helped if   the x  files   gillian anderson had been cast instead   especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression !  from the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence   moore is scully !  mortensen   who i liked in   g   i    jane     opts to play sam loomis as a cowboy/hick   which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point    sam has a twang and a cowboy hat   but that s about it    mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory    anne heche   in the janet leigh role   does a few good things in her brief time on screen    at least her marion crane has a little life in her   which can t be said for most of the rest of the cast    the best work   though   comes from vince vaughn   as the demented mama s boy   norman bates    he s not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins   but he is effective both in being naughty and nice    the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn   where they simply talk    there is some solid acting there   something that is not carried through the rest of the film    van sant has made a boring film    all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 aren t as eye catching now    what passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they don t impress or excite    van sant   in what i assume is a grasp at originality   decided to put some stream of consciousness images into a few famous scenes   was that a lamb in the middle of the road      these images   included with some questionable editing choices   took away from the scenes themselves and caused   at first   bewilderment and   later   laughter    definitely not hitchcock s intention !  at least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmann s original famous and terrific score    if a film like   psycho   does not frighten   then what s the point    aside from norman   the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience    there are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting    in the end   however   the new   psycho   is a noble attempt   but   alas   a dismal failure    
Pos, note   ordinarily   moviereviews   org will not give away any critical plot points of a film that could be interpreted as   spoilers      however   being that music of the heart is based on a true story and that moviereviews   org  feels the film can not be properly credited without such revelations   plot giveaways will appear in the following review    if this bothers you   please note the 3 star rating of the film and stop reading now       what does it take to play carnegie hall    practice      it takes two hours for music of the heart to   play carnegie hall     both figuratively and literally    like the children it portrays   the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a show stopping performance at the legendary concert hall    roberta guaspari   academy award winner meryl streep   has two kids   a husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean    her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school    she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors    that is the pattern like plot of this production    ultimately   the film chooses a zero sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an all time high when the men in her life finally vanish    the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful    roberta s character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat    also lacking depth is the film s   bad guy     a narrow minded music teacher   josh pais   who rejects roberta out of principle   the movie never explains exactly which principle that is   and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around    the next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre    they are highlighted by one child s return to roberta s class   coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can t be around anymore because   my mom said           and a glowing concert    not knowing the running time   you may expect the credits to role at this point    but they don t    instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent    director wes craven   known for his works of horror   uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing    one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic   but        last night          and roberta s two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father s absence    the city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie    roberta s mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype    the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens   predictably one of roberta s students is gunned down and killed off screen    one thing the film does lack is subtlety    the fact that a little boy was playing   we shall overcome   on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference    the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience       of course   in horror films the foreshadowing and between the line moments are meant to be overdone   so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game      even with all its flaws   music of the heart is a beautiful film    that is not an excuse for the movie s poor beginning    but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall   i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage    in december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history    the performance included a dead on elvis impression   robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies    so   how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life    he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience    perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santa s favorite food   this movie has an amazing finale    
Pos, part one of   the strangest movies ever made   series at www   mediajunkies   com  by scott watson  [light spoilers   nothing you shouldn t read]  existenz has been called   a gooey matrix     and while this is a correct description in some ways   in others it is completely off    the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal     real   reality    a major difference is that   the matrix   has a base reality that is obviously the true reality   while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true    and oh what a reality it is    david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies   naked lunch   crash     but this one is one of the strangest    maybe it s because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre    technology is organic   but only some of it    cars are normal    gas stations are the same    cell phones are glowing bug like appendages    you jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus   referred to simply as a   pod        high technology has been replaced with organic creatures   and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters    a famous game designer   allegra geller   a fine looking jennifer jason leigh     flees a demonstration of her latest game   existenz   after an assassination attempt    she is on the run   from who   i m still not sure     and has to save her pod by playing her game with   someone friendly      that someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard   ted pikul   jude law      unfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement for playing   a bioport    sort of a hole in your spine   ok   exactly like a hole in your spine     a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail looking wires from the pod into you   allowing you to play the game    luckily a bioport can be installed easily   they install them in malls     so off they go to get one    after a crazy series of events at the local country gas station   they are able to plug in and play existenz    the plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies   reality distortion   chinese restaurants   and multi appendaged amphibian things     it s a sign of the times        but the plot   while cohesive in it s own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe    cronenberg just slaps this weird organic tech world into the viewers lap   and it s up to you to figure out how all these things work    and that s the true joy of this film   entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place    you learn a little bit piece by piece   oh   they make pods out of those     and it s just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you    there are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around   including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards    also the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz   the specifics of which i will leave for you to discover    there s lots of little things that set off the weird o meter   like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store   the two headed amphibian creature   and why that guy at the gas station s name appears to be   gas      it all adds up to a supremely far out trip   and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrix s virtual world        oh wait   i already do    
Pos, there s some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn t and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did       lucky numbers   is a perfect example of this because it s such a blatant rip off of   fargo   and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me    i know i m in the minority here but let me explain    the film takes place in harrisburg   pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter    john travolta plays the local big shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards    russ is married to crystal   lisa kudrow     a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema    she s a selfish   nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl   not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market    crystal s cheating on russ with their collective boss dick   ed o neil     the tv station manager    she doesn t seem to genuinely like either of them   but it s all she can do in this one horse town    much like   fargo     this movie tells the story of a man who s going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick    he enlists the help of his english friend gig   tim roth     the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery    along the way a subplot involving a two bit thug named   accurately     dale the thug     michael rappaport   gets mixed up in the process    there s also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down    i m not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you re not expecting    this is a farce   which is basically a straightforward   adult oriented comedy but doesn t go as far as a classic black comedy should    where as   fargo   was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny     lucky numbers   is just funny because you can t take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously    it s all a big cartoon basically   but it s funny and i can respect that    travolta is great in his role and even though he s not a really likable character   he s trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he s a creep    he s like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill    crystal is just the opposite   she s constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself    kudrow is perfect in this role since she s spent 8 years on tv as the dim witted phoebe on   friends      here is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe    i have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money    like   jackie brown       an elmore leonard adaption     the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally    the screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus    more and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic   cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do    the ending itself is great    it s surprising and funny and makes you feel good    you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies  worth of stories into two hours  time and didn t fall apart   although many other critics might beg to differ      i liked it   and i could see it again   isn t that what makes a movie good    
Pos, those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo s novel les miserables    i don t know if a lot of people have   though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel    i haven t even seen that    going into this film   i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters   i even expected the film to be a musical      walking away from it   i m kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material    writer/director bille august s film version is a straightforward   beautifully told film    liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean   in the beginning   he has just been released from a 19 year prison sentence    he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior    the priest s words of wisdom influence him   and he makes a vow to change himself    nine years later   we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo   nobody knows his real name   and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago    conflicts arise when inspector javert   geoffrey rush   is assigned to vigo    valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him   and javert remembers jean to be a convict    javert is hell bent on upholding the law   and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice    along the way   valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman   fantine   uma thurman     and vows to take care of her daughter   cosette   played later by claire danes      les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture    the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast   and the sets don t look like sets   they look like real towns and villages     gabriella pescucci s costumes are noticeably spectacular    basil poledouris  soundtrack is thick and usually well placed   though it does get a bit heavy at times      many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality   such as the climax   which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening    augusts keeps the story simple   which i hear is a good thing   since the novel is so complex   and easy to follow    he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately    i was also impressed that he didn t go overboard with flash and style   which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days   such as baz luhrmann s vicious tragedy william shakespeare s romeo + juliet      this film feels solid and whole   and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested    liam neeson is terrific in the main role   neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well   and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective    thurman   in her small role   is very good   and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non glamorous role such as this one    rush is absolutely incredible as javert   i don t remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here   he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances   and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense    i can t be as charitable for danes   however   though i know she is a talented actress   here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit    les miserables is   as i ve said   a solid   intelligent motion picture    my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy   and perhaps too staged    each scene is grand and huge   and exploding with poledouris  score   but i didn t always want them to be    for the most part   les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture    it s a good movie   and tells its story well   but august tends to hand feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle    however   in a film this exciting and well produced   a few minor flaws are easily overlooked    
Pos, titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it s upsetting that it isn t    the film   which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it  sunk    pun intended   is a labour of love for cameron   who wrote and directed the film    we all know that big budget dosen t mean great film   see waterworld   1995     but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic    but sadly   titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece   although it is one of cameron s best films    the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic    they find a safe   and inside a picture of a woman    the woman in the picture   an old winslet   tells the explorers that the picture is of her    the explorers invite her over   and she then tells her story of titanic    in the flashback   dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson   who   after winning a poker game   wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic   leaving liverpool to go to america    also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater   winslet   who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen t love at all   cal hockley   zane   so her family can remain rich    she nearly commits suicide on the ship   but jack comes to the rescue   saves rose   they fall in love   and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them    oh yeah   and the ship sinks    and that is the main problem with the film   and which stops it from being a work of genius    the story and script   both by cameron   are both weak    the story is full of cliched characters     the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry   the poor boy with heart   the stuck up mother   and poor dialogue   the script consists of lots of in jokes of how the boat won t sink   and most of the dialogue is pretty basic   it s a shame really   as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film    without good dialogue   a film could become a very long   very boring film   like camerons own terminator 2   1992   but   luckily   there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear    firstly   there s cameron s direction    there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic   and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic    but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end    there is a lot of mayhem and panic   all done very well by cameron    it s a scary sight   watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below    thanks to cameron s direction   then   the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes    to support the directing are the excellent cast   working very well with their underwritten characters    dicaprio is good   although he only looks 16 17 years old    his performance of a over excitiable   yet also well mannered boy is excellent   and he also has some funny lines    winslet is great also   and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth    zane is deliciously evil as cal   saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash    the audience really does come to hate him    he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he s in   like dead calm   1988   but he does it really   really well    also worthy of note is kathy bates   edward scissorhands   1990   as a loud mouthed american    finally   the icing on the  great things  cake are the special effects    cameron is a whiz with effects   just watch aliens   1988     terminator 2 and true lies   1994   and they are used very well throughout    the sweeps of the ships are awesome   although digital domain   who did the effects   cannot animate human movement too well    the humans seem to move to  smoothly    there s just something odd about them    you can tell that they have been animated on a computer    of course   the ship sinking scenes are awesome   with bodies flying all over the place   and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed    titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film    titanic   then   is a wonder of directing   acting and cgi   but not writing and story    again   like most of camerons films   the editing is loose   cameron edits himself     and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts    titanic   then   although not the godfather of movies it could of been   is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius    enjoyable   scary   and even sad   titanic is a film cinema was invented for   filling the screen with incredible images   and assaulting the ears with awesome sound    a superb film   but sadly not perfect    overall rating=    
Pos, after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard   out steps a steel gray   human like creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit    spencer   the boy who observes this   having seen his fill of science fiction flicks   figures this thing must be a robot from outer space    with the exception of disney and a few others   most studios view children s films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit    star kid stands out as that rare kids  film that is undoubtedly low budget but is also highly imaginative    remember   the robot    it wasn t one at all but rather a   phase one assault cyborsuit      the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors    the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit   and the cyborsuit   nicknamed cy   has plenty of spunk    cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like   cool      upon hearing that   command     cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop    and when cy speaks   we see spencer s view   the backside of cy s lips and eyes    as 12 year old spencer   joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue tied kid    even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit   he has his fears but he learns to overcome them       if you run away   things don t get better   whether it s bullies   spiders   or girls     his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three    turbo   joey simmrin     the school s chubby bully   beats up on him   spiders frighten him   and   most embarrassing of all   he can t speak when in the presence of his would be girlfriend    with his cyborsuit on   he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy    spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey   played by a smart mouthed ashlee levitch   who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker    stacey derides her brother   whom she barely tolerates   by referring to him only as   the fungus      this whole setup for spencer s downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment    the beauty of mazzello s performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he ll not soon forget    the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics   but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing    the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately    when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire   michelle   lauren eckstrom     his eyes open wide in revulsion       mate with her !

Pos, capsule   bleak and point blank    just the way it should be    makes its case with cold blooded precision and intelligence       serial killer chic   is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary   and one of the more stomach turning ones    i ve never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers   and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry    i wasn t sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero/antihero    thankfully   that s not the way henry works    the director   john mcnaughton   took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work    it doesn t provide cheap jack explanations for henry s behavior   it shows him up for what he is   an unrepentant and un idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him    at the film s opening   henry s friend ottis toole has a sister   who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago    in a viciously riveting scene   he admits matter of factly to having murdered his own mother   and she covers his hand with hers    they are damned together from that moment on    henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun    the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it   there s a scene where the two go to buy a new tv    the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words   and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron    no preface    it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker    in a scene which many damned the movie for   unseen   they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household   playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment    the movie itself   however   does not glorify the killings   but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work   only irritation    henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting    michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame   just standing there   and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well    the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton   but he decided to give them something more memorable   and consequently the film nearly didn t see release    the film does not glorify or justify    it just shows us   with unflinching coldness   what henry was    i m hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of   victim   or   hero      then again   probably   so would henry    
Neg, eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights    as the movie s writer   director   executive producer   and star   murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails    but at the same time   he ll receive all of the credit if it succeeds    should you sacrifice your hard earned cash to support murphy s risky gamble    well   that depends on whom you trust more   me or eddie murphy    here s what murphy thinks     i think the audience is expecting a good time    they gonna get sexy    they gonna get funny    they gonna get drama    they gonna get all of that    i think it s the best movie i ve done     paramount radio network      here s what i think   harlem nights is charmless   unoriginal   disappointing   and almost without question   the worst film of the actor s career   i haven t seen best defense      and guess who s to blame   !  the movie s problem is not murphy s direction   harlem nights is a fairly good looking film    no   the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled    murphy s awful script is the culprit    let s count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting       1   murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture    yes   he even outdoes his own work in raw    practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word    and after 15 minutes   it gets irritating       2   murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast    richard pryor   redd foxx   michael lerner   and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes    each of them shines occasionally   but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle       3   the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men    murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life   which is really neither here nor there    but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3   000 movie screens across the country   it s another matter altogether    you re forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff    for instance   murphy punches della reese in the stomach    and he shoots jasmine guy in the head    this is a mean spirited movie   folks !  lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore   but only because she doesn t have any scenes with murphy    thank god   he might have run her over with a bulldozer       4   murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date    the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film    murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality    sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair       5   the plot is a shameless rip off of the sting    if you re going to make another sting movie   you ve got to do something original    murphy s tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem   circa 1938   fails to add anything new to the formula       6   to get laughs   murphy makes fun of stuttering    you know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped       7   murphy s idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life    for what    for shooting reese s little toe off !  needless to say   murphy shows little   if any   promise or imagination as a screenwriter    in all fairness   however   a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie    danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take    aiello stands out in the large   ensemble cast   he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character   a racist detective with mob ties      aiello s zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice    another bright spot is arsenio hall   who has a hilarious   show stopping cameo as a cry baby gangster   hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy    in fact   hall s ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie    unfortunately   his character is completely irrelevant to the plot   murphy should have given hall a much bigger role    of course   i ve already mentioned that i didn t care for murphy s character   but i have to admit that i did love his neckties    they are simply spectacular  almost worth the price of admission    
Pos, i like movies with albert brooks   and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks    lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies    his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today   inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator    you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film   while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent   talk films   which are finding their way into theaters    the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with   but even if we can t   brooks has the talent to make them comfortable   and therefore we laugh    teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won t find an albert brooks movie very funny   but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will    put simply   brooks  comedy is intelligent    mother is albert brooks  latest film   and it does not disappoint    brooks plays john henderson   a middle aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce    he makes an attempt at dating   but fails miserably    he then has dinner with his brother jeff   rob morrow     a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life    jeff has a good job   a loving family   and most of all   a warm relationship with their mother beatrice   debbie reynolds      after dinner   john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice   and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky dory the dialog is    in comparison   beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him   and john gives it right back to her    at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john s life   she says     i love you     and john replies with     i know you think you do      the thing is   beatrice is not overt with her criticisms   but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit picking and guilt loading    it s the kind that goes something like     yes   dear   i think you do that wonderfully   but            it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy    there s always the big but    john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women   either because of his flawed self esteem caused by his need for validation   or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner    he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home   he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out   and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is       a great experiment     he calls it    brooks  own brand of humor really shines in this film   especially in the interaction john has with his mother    there s a scene where john has just arrived at his mother s house   and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito   and having explained to his mother about the   great experiment     beatrice asks     now explain to me again why you don t want to stay at a hotel      she still doesn t get it   and it is absolutely hilarious    in the same scene   we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh    she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over    when john points out the ice on the sherbet   beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze       you ve named the ice      asks john    he s also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator   such as a twenty pound block of cheese       the freezer was a good invention     says john     but it s not supposed to be used for everything    that s why it s smaller than the refrigerator      it s something most of us find strangely familiar    brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur    for example   in defending your life   his and meryl streep s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion    when they re finished and walk out   brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line     and so the moral is   if you have to fart   go outside !    you don t know what the joke was because you couldn t hear him during the entire scene   but i must have laughed for the next five minutes   it seemed so out of context    in this film   brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene    i don t want to give them away   but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past    john s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn   and we as the audience learn right along with him    his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with   but as john spends more time with her   we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth    watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way    on screen   brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character   you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world    in a way   he s very much like yosarian of catch 22   expect with something of an attitude    casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect    she assumes the part with ease   even moving and speaking a little slowly   and is just so adorable it s hard to get mad at her character    this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her    as his first choice   brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice   but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband   who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer s disease    that may be just as well   since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely    rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother s favorite and   for all his success in his job and family   is slowly exposed as a mama s boy    the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes    a solid connection is not really made between john s troubles and his reasons for living with his mother    additionally   the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals   and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting   how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this      beatrice   you must think i m some kind of moron    john   no   i think your someone who thinks i m a moron    beatrice   well   it takes one to know one    
Pos, i m not quite sure how best to go about writing this review    i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson s political satire   wag the dog     but in retrospect   this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it    quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through   and it didn t do that    they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all too true attack on the way the american political media works   and it didn t quite do that either    a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick s   dr    strangelove   in the tradition of political black comedy   and it most definitely didn t do that    that said     wag the dog   is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them    the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean   robert deniro   to distract the american public from the accusations that the president   who is up for re election in two weeks   sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office    the accusations   the script suggests   are probably untrue   but as brean so pointedly puts it   that isn t particularly relevant   the scandal is likely to derail the president s campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood    brean   along with his assistant   anne heche     decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss   dustin hoffman   to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special effects trickery to make it appear that the u   s   is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor    as i said     wag the dog   is not quite as laugh out loud hilarious as i had expected   but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here   such as when   in an echo of a familiar movie clich     the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting   inspirational music   then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform   we have the right to fight for democracy      another scene shows us how   with modern editing equipment   an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village    the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team s attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt    william   old shoe   schumann   woody harrelson     an ex military officer who turns out to be a first class psycho    of course   not everything goes as planned   the cia   for example   realizes what s going on and strikes a deal with the president s electoral opponent to report to the media that the   fighting   has ended   forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis    still   even with the cia s involvement   the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable    regardless of the official word from the president or the cia   wouldn t the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is   in fact   no fighting going on in albania    the film never addresses this question   nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical   such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt    schumann   we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it    there was also an instance   towards the end of the film   in which one of motss s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away    with these plot holes     wag the dog   doesn t quite work as a satire of american politics   but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place    brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical   rather   they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off    the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end   as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret    motss and his hollywood buddies   meanwhile   seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project    in fact   one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss s increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war   in his mind   it is the greatest work of art he has ever created    i think it s fair to say that   wag the dog   underachieves a little bit   more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four star film and a classic satire    still   the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one    wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks   what if the war wasn t even real    with this premise and the talented cast   the film still delivers more consistently than most   whatever its flaws    
Neg, if you ve been following william fichtner s career   and there s absolutely no reason why you should have     you might have noticed that he s played some rather similar roles over the years    like sully in   the perfect storm     tough   gruff   and a little bit scary    or law in   albino alligator     tough   gruff   and little bit scarier    or colonel william sharp in   armageddon     or dwayne engelman in   strange days     or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of   pearl harbor     as the abusive father of danny  here is an actor who gravitates towards tough   gruff   hard hitting roles    which is why his performance in   what s the worst that could happen      is such a shock   such a delight    in the film   fichtner plays a blonde haired   meticulously dressed   overtly effeminate   dog loving detective    as alex tardio   fichtner s performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it    it borders on offensive but doesn t really manage it    and it borders on clich   d stereotype but doesn t quite succumb to that definition either    in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming   fichtner isn t perfect  you can see him struggling a little at times   concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air   or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personal  but he s pretty damned good   and silly   and without question the best thing in the film    in fact   had it not been for fitchner s sudden and bizarre appearance   and his jarring screen presence thereafter   i would have walked out   for   what s the worst that could happen      is mesmerizing in its awfulness   a poorly written   haphazardly edited   and totally unfunny   yes   it stars martin lawrence and danny devito so how could that be possible      moviegoing experience    fichtner s performance doesn t exactly save the film   and it s not like i m recommending   what s the worst that could happen      solely on the strength of the actor s dramatic turnaround   but his contributions do raise the film s rating from no stars to one and a half    thumbs up to fichtner then   and thumbs down  way   way   down  to everyone else involved in this sorry mess   a movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesn t even warrant discussion    
Pos, it s not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts    but that s just what happened to me at uhf   weird al yankovic s big screen debut    uhf is a television parody a la airplane   and like airplane   the movie is extraordinarily stupid    but it s dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb   it s so silly and outrageous it s hilarious    the movie stars weird al as george newman   a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination   the type who fantasizes he s indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns    george is basically a loser   his daydreams and smart alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks    but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station    george revives channel 62 with innovative programming   shows like   wheel of fish   and movies like   conan   the librarian      as the station s ratings rise   it comes into competition with channel 8   the leading vhf network affiliate    as r   j    fletcher  channel 8 s ill natured   hard nosed owner  veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy   he really hams it up with his snorts   grimaces   and scowls    uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television   including game shows   tabloid talk shows   children s shows   dizzy news women   and movies  everything from rambo to close encounters    the funniest scene   the one that made my head spin   is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed    like most movies in its genre   uhf is hit or miss    for every gag that works   at least one fizzles    for instance   weird al s mock video of   money for nothing   by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt   although it does have some nifty computer animation      but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail   we know another gut wrencher is on the way    in fact   uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane type movie since        well   since airplane    much of the credit goes to weird al s exceptionally inventive script and to the movie s winsome cast    weird al seems a little stiff at the beginning   but because he s not afraid to look silly   he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character    the real standout is michael richards as stanley   the dim witted janitor who becomes the host of his own children s show     stanley spadowski s playhouse      stanley s off beat   mixed up personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an over night star    he is an endearing mixture of good natured innocence   high energy enthusiasm   and puppy dog cuteness    and above all   he s a good janitor who adores his work    another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips    the cast also features gedde watanabe   the chinese foreign exchange student in sixteen candles   as the karate master who hosts the hit series     wheel of fish      also aboard for the ride is fran drescher   who plays pamela finklestein   channel 62 s roving reporter    unfortunately   as weird al s girlfriend   victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing but whimpering   whining   and sulking    her character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether    while uhf is not an absolute must see   it s definitely the ticket if you re looking for a wild and zany   whacked out comedy    the movie is good enough to see in the theaters   but it may work even better on television   the very medium at which it pokes fun    
Neg, man   this was one wierd movie    similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn t decide which genre it is    the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone   which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship    the last half hour    this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided     screw it   let s just kill everybody      from then on   forget sci fi       this  movie becomes 100% horror    what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way    instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare   this movie just uses loud noises   sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore           yawn         everyone s  seen it all before and knows when to expect it    the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew    there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed   but what did this    then finally after being painfully restored   the new crew views the video    the acting isn t too bad at all           considering what the actors had to work with anyway   as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of    there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though   like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space    this movie could have been so much better    it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with    there was just nothing new here that any of us haven t seen before in aliens or hellraiser    
Pos, most sequels don t do what they re supposed to do like   toy story 2   does    far too many of them end up re hashing the original and adding very little    is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors    thankfully     toy story 2   is a wonderful exception    i can t remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one    it s yet another sign that pixar   the acclaimed animation studio behind   toy story   and   a bug s life     is still at the top of its game    woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit   toy story     and things have changed a bit since the last one ended    woody   voiced by tom hanks   is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp    in his absence   he has assigned buzz lightyear   tim allen     now comfortable in his role as a toy   to take charge    unfortunately   woody s trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale   and is stolen by an over zealous toy collector   wayne knight      off to save him are buzz and members of the old   toy gang     including mr   potato head   don rickles     rex the nervous dinosaur   wallace shawn     hamm the piggy bank   john ratzenberger     and slinky dog   jim varney      while in captivity   woody makes a startling discovery   he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950 s children s show entitled   woody s roundup      he meets the show s other characters   which include jesse   joan cusack     his cowgirl sidekick   the wise old prospector   kelsey grammer     and bullseye   his trusty horse    they have all been anxiously awaiting woody s arrival   as once their set is completed   they will be sold to a japanese toy museum   and finally escape storage forever    this means woody now faces a difficult choice    with his friends coming to rescue him   does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy   or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever    as in the original film     toy story 2   contains first rate animation   and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there    reportedly   the film was originally slated for a direct to video release   but after seeing the improvements that had been made   disney rightly decided to release it into theaters    the film is well worth seeing on the big screen    the colors are bright   the textures sharp   and even the human characters look more   human      the animation is consistently seamless   with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable    there are so many impressive sequences that i d find it impossible to list them here   but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al  s toy barn   the store owned by woody s captor    pixar s rendition of the family dog is also nicely done   with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it    the voice work is also perfectly complementary   and as with the first movie   does much to help further character development    tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz   making you forget who is doing the voice    it was woody and buzz up there   not tom and tim    all the cast members from the original reprise their roles   and each is excellent    several new voices have been added   with joan cusack   kelsey grammer   and wayne knight doing fine work       toy story 2   is strong in characterization   and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie    woody faces difficult choices   while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn t yet realized his status as a toy   forcing him to see what he used to be like    the new characters are also developed quite well   especially jesse   who narrates a sarah mclachlan aided flashback illustrating how she was loved   then forgotten by her owner    it may be computer animated   and it may have sappy music   but it s downright touching    the script   despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers   is endlessly clever and inventive   especially considering that it s a sequel    the reason   toy story 2   works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original s success by re doing the same story and using the same characters    not this one    we get character change   new characters   and new issues brought up       toy story 2   is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself    there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here    the humor is sharp and witty   with something to amuse both kids and adults    there are funny asides to films such as   star wars   and   jurassic park     among others   new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock  em sock  em robots   and appearances from other pixar efforts   a bug s life   and the 1997 short   geri  s game         geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody s broken arm      the action is fast and furious   and the chases   in the street   in a toy store   in an elevator   on a baggage carousel   and in an airplane   keep getting bigger and better       toy story 2   never grows stagnant   because there is always something new to hold your interest    the more you pay attention to it   the more rewarding it is    it s rare to see a film like   toy story 2   come along   because it s the kind of film that s almost impossible to dislike    it s created purely to entertain   and though i enjoy a thought provoking drama as much as the next person   it s nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do   send us out with a smile    it s a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing   toy story 2     it s the rare sequel that manages to expand on   and live up to   the original

Neg, often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into   the call of the oboe   o toque do oboe   is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray    many elements of the film are solid   and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know   but they simply don t convert into a solid work    although a setting is never established   it becomes apparent    the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day    the community is a dull one   where every day is a downhill slide from the last    over time   the people have taken to themselves    the town cinema is closed   no tourist has passed through in years   and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger    so what happens when a   tourist     paolo betti   does arrive one day    he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock    it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby    when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance   the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years    it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers   and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film   thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages    the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner   leticia vota   who also happens to be engaged to the town s police inspector   a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance s involvement with this musician    the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray    it features a character who literally rises from his grave   a woman who has a phone conversation with god   and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character   to an almost humorous drunk    technically   this film is a nightmare    the music score is poorly edited into the film   so it is often choppy   rough   and abrupt    the lighting is poor at best   which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes   and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words   and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases    this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue   but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words    in addition   the pace of the film seems uneven    it opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one s patience    the film then moves into a faster pace   that again slows towards the end   as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark    there was   however   potential for this film    it is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music   and the re unification of people    these are all topics that could easily fill a movie    perhaps   if there were no freak show   and the technical aspects were to improve   there might just be a thing of beauty at the end    most importantly   though   the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren t such a bore    until then   there seems to be little more hope for this piece   than that boy has by simply crying out   mommy   while he wanders astray in a park

Pos, originally entitled dancing about architecture   i   e       talking about love is like dancing about architecture       but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box office dud dancing at lughnasa   this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names   playing interesting and well written characters   within a vignettes styled plot arrangement a la robert altman    plot   follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love   finding themselves   regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are   and who they want   and appreciating the fine emotional art of love    critique   charmingly effective romantic drama   this film offers insight into various types of relationships   presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast   and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties    how do people fall in love    why do people fall out of love    how do people fall back into love   once they ve been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club    all of these questions and more   are touched upon in this film   within several types of variant relationships    meet a hip   young couple going through their first date    a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships    a married woman   finding herself   while cheating on her husband    a husband letting go of his inhibitions    an older couple dealing with a past   love   of the man   a secret recently uncovered    a son dying from aids   joined by his mother at the hospital    there are many nuances to this picture   and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate   but more importantly   there is diversity    diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels    some related to the younger couples  issues    others with the married    there s a little bit of everything for everyone in here    and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year   i would relate myself to yet another predicament    just like love itself   this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels    the actors in this film are all also very   very good    sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve   as is gena rowlands   as the aging wife with trepidations    jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance   while philippe is as pretty boy as ever    anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re ignite her love life   opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk show host   jon stewart    even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film   and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination    the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached   was the part surrounding jay mohr   the man dying from aids   and his mother   ellen burstyn    the actors were fine   but somehow   the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else    the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me   but i guess that s just hollywood    this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors   5   5/10   and happiness   4   5/10   in concept and style   but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness    the characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care   as opposed to this film   which offers rich and believable characters   living real lives and talking about real issues in today s relationships    all in all   this movie offers many interesting characters   talking and living genuine and engaging love lives   wonderful performances by its solid cast   too sweet of an ending   but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless    little known facts about this film and its stars   according to a story in the london sunday mirror   sean connery asked for only $60   000 for his role in this movie   as compared to his usual fee of $14 million   because he liked the script so much    on top of that   he convinced his co stars

Pos, robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire   one with class and style    the film   set in old detroit in the year 1991   stars peter weller as murphy   a lieutenant on the city s police force    1991 s detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor   security concepts inc     whose employees   the cops   are threatening to strike    to make matters worse   a savage group of cop killers has been terrorizing the city    on murphy s first day of duty   after his transfer from another precinct   these cop killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one       orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m   p   a   a      after the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead   s   c   i    recruits his remains for their new   robocop   program    using the remains of murphy s body as a foundation   their scientists build a cyborg   made of both flesh and metal    the cyborg   robocop   is half human   murphy   and half robot   the s   c   i    engineers have erased murphy s memory and replaced it with a computer program   or so they think      with his lightning quick reflexes   immense strength   and impenetrable armor   s   c   i    envisions robocop as an indestructible super cop   the solution to detroit s problems    the remainder of the plot follows robocop s crime foiling and vengeance on his murderers    as a science fiction action thriller   robocop is extremely effective    dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense   shocking gore   and spectacular special effects    several sequences in the film   such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist   are destined to become cult classics    because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing   it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience  in other words   in a movie theater    although the special effects and action are exciting   they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre    rather   robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society    the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative   terrorism   board games   and television news broadcasts with air headed anchors    these news broadcasts   which are exceptionally clever   recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore    the satire in robocop   however   is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood    1990 s america   as portrayed in the film   may seem far fetched but is in actuality   i think   only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society    the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd    verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary    unfortunately   robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre    the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior   the terminator   and aliens    robocop s main problem   aside from its dumb title   is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy s character    we never learn the degree to which murphy   as robocop   is human and the degree to which he is a robot    does murphy have any human spirit or free will left   or is he merely a computer following a program    the script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action    moreover   it almost completely ignores the question   and tragedy   of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine    robocop also contains several bothersome loose ends    as you watch robocop   you experience deja vu   you feel as if you have seen the film before    in many respects   robocop is reminiscent of several other films   including the terminator   return of the jedi   and even death wish    however   to its credit   robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip off    
Neg, supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898    john patterson   val kilmer     the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation   tried to rid his operation of the lions   but fails    a world renound hunter   remington   michael douglas     is called in and the battle   man against lion   begins    this film has a great soundtrack   and wonderful scenery    the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin    we only see one side of each character    kilmer is a bridge builder and that s all we see him as    these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesn t even appear to be too upset about it    and the plot    it s jaws   but with lions    again we re presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should    it appears to kill men because it just likes too    why    who knows    i guess there wouldn t be much of a story if it didn t    the problem is that there isn t much of a story even though it does    
Pos, the disney studios has its formula for annual   full length animated features down so pat that it s hard to remember which one you re watching at any given moment       mulan     their 36th animated adventure   is the latest case in point    once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character   female as usual   disney is one of the few studios whose heroines  ariel   belle   pocahontas   and now mulan  get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years      add the requisite love interest and a wise cracking sidekick or two   pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes   an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror   a rousing anthem   a cutesy   montage backed crowd pleaser     pose a few threats to our engaging lead   and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits    bob s your uncle !  better make that walt s your uncle        kids will no doubt go ga ga over   mulan     or at least the fast food tie ins     but familiarity can   after a while   leave grown ups  this reviewer included  wishing for a little more    maybe an animated feature without  shock !  horror !   the  songs   for example    or maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad      how about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether    it isn t gonna happen    like disney s previous entries     mulan   is slow to make its mark    the animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element   a madcap dragon wannabe   in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth   courtesy eddie murphy s animated vocal talents     plays like an inappropriate if necessary   formula wise   afterthought    however   after about an hour everything comes together and the formula   like it or not   clicks    highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow covered pass   which   due to the sophistication of today s computer generated imagery   is hard to tell from the real thing     a memorable   show stopping musical interlude     i ll make a man out of you     penned by matthew wilder and david zippel     and last but not least   mulan herself    voiced by ming na wen   mulan is disney s strongest female character to date    when hordes of huns pour over china s great wall and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace   the emperor decrees that every family in the land dispatch one man to serve in the imperial army    since mulan s father is infirm   but proud   the high spirited mulan steals her father s armor and   incognito   signs up to face the mongolian menace    attracted to   but not distracted by   her commanding officer shang   b   d    wong     mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts   wit   and physical ability    she s a woman of the  90s a couple of millennia ahead of her time    
Neg, the first image in   final fantasy   the spirits within   is a computer animated close up of a human eye    it s a beautiful piece of work   remarkably detailed and quite convincing    when the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye   however   things change    the young woman has mesmerizing hair   although it hangs too artfully   even by movie standards   to be believed    the facial features are more detailed than any computer animation seen to date   but the result is more reminiscent of a very well crafted doll than anything human    she is pretty   but bland   and not nearly expressive enough to come off like a person    all the characters in   final fantasy   are like that    of the core group   the younger white men and women are all athletic   attractive and indistinct   like applicants for a tv reality show    the black man is taller and burlier   and the aging scholar is bald   with wrinkles and a beard    none of them appear to be based on individuals   they all look like the products of general descriptions given a police sketch artist    it gets worse when they talk and move    why is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi   he of the great twisted face and snaggleteeth   coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll    why   for every fluid physical gesture   do we also see herky jerky puppet style motions    more to the point   who decided a full length computer animated movie featuring   hyperreal     their term   not mine   humanoids was a good idea       final fantasy   is based on a phenomenally popular video game i ve never played   with a story straight out of japanese anime   which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed    if you re a fan of either   please spare me your letters   as i will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials    with an expression challenged cast     final fantasy   mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit    the result is ugly   confusing and boring    note   the following reveals the basic plot    if you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie   i suggest you read it    earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls    most of our planet is devastated   with humans living in a few protected cities    while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies   aki ross   voiced by ming na   and her mentor   dr   sid   donald sutherland     believe in a more organic approach    they operate on the notion   quoting straight from the press kit     that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained    aki and dr   sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force    the waves will   in effect   cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion    they have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave    they are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out      are you still with me    there s only a little more    aki is infected with the alien force    dr   sid has developed a method of confining the contagion and keeping it from killing her   but the defense wall won t hold much longer    already   the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams    aiding aki and dr   sid are the deep eyes   a group of hard as nails types that would have felt at home with the troops in   aliens      capt   gray edwards   alec baldwin   heads the task force that consists of a wise guy   buscemi     a tough woman   peri gilpin   and a gentle giant   ving rhames      throwing a monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass   in this case general hein   james woods     who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens back to the stone age   even if it destroys earth as well    so there you have it    like most of the anime i ve seen   the plot combines apocalyptic settings   lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality   all wrapped up in a save the earth bow    but i m bored with apocalyptic settings    i understand why so many live action films employ them   they re cheap   but animated films can show anything   so why wallow in an industrial trash heap    the action scenes and shoot em ups don t satisfy either    the humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can t bring them to life   in fact   their efforts merely emphasize what we re missing      aki is especially disappointing   with her lack of expression and flat delivery   she looks and sound like a brunet version of weena   the eloi girl from 1960 s   the time machine      drab color choices and aliens that appear to have been created in jell o molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces    students of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind   final fantasy   the spirits within     but i found it sub par across the board       futurama   does more effective battle visuals   the kids in   south park   are far more expressive than these mannequins and any old episode of the contemporary version of   the outer limits   does better doom and gloom sci fi    so who needs this    not me    
Neg, the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as  anywhere but here      there isn t one thing about this mother daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest    it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives   as for some reason they couldn t figure it out for themselves    if the film looks familiar   that is because   the slums of beverly hills   98     went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances   in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with    alvin sargent s script was weak and annoyingly claustral    wayne wang s     the joy luck club     inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn t convey    pushy mother adele august   susan sarandon   forces her 14 year old daughter ann   natalie portman   to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross country with her to beverly hills    the daughter resents her twice divorced   unstable but exotic   schoolteacher mother   bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life    the daqughter doesn t even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can t stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio    so it becomes a question of who knows best   as the ladies fight it out between them   until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner    adele s dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn t look that good   as she lands a job in a slum school   has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids   and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive    daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there    during one of many arguments with her free spirited mom   they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed   she runs away   only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop   michael milhoan     who offers her wise counsel    with the cop s zen wisdom passed onto the daughter   she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla    during their stay in beverly hills   she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer   a t   s    eliot   corbin allred   reader    but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality   as everything seemed staged and unemotional    when she learns her cousin benny   shawn hatosy     who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin   she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn t clearly shown why she wants to stay there   and for that matter   it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly    the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams    i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say   is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one   able to recognize mother s faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself    mother has a series of setbacks   like being dumped by her dream boat dentist   bochner   she met on the beach   and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part    but mother learns that her daughter has grown up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her    she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do   is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do    this of course results in the corny ending   showing that mom s heart was always in the right place   only she went about it in the wrong way    this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing    
Neg, there s only one presidential election every four years   but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as  the  thriller of the year    in 1997   we ve had absolute power   air force one   shadow conspiracy and murder at 1600    this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford   trying to bring us a complex plot of cover up and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys    here s what happens this time    it s night at the white house    a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt    the next day she s dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in    how do we know he s a hotshot    we ve seen the traditional action flick opener    the clever hostage negotiation scene    it s not so clever this time   consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex government employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street    snipes is off to the white house   where he finds the secret service head   the shiny bald head of daniel benzali   won t cooperate with him at all    in fact   if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda   snipes wouldn t have been allowed in the white house at all    alda helps snipes out further   assigning a sexy secret service agent   diane lane   to act as his liaison        a very dangerous liaison    well   not really   i just wanted to say that    almost immediately   a suspect is found   an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos    snipes doesn t buy it   and launches into an independent investigation of his own   one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the president s son    snipes  partner   an always  wisecracking dennis miller   calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane   who at first doesn t believe snipes   eventually and predictably comes around   and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information    for the first hour or so   murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting    sure   we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that   but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon    snipes and lane don t make for a bad action team   but with nothing to work with   they re just cogs in the bad movie machine    dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie   they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood   and that s saying a lot    when you get to the last half hour   the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer   busting out the old break into the building underground climax    and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why   you ll wish you never sat through this movie at all    the   1600   in the movie s title doesn t represent an address   it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide    serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century !  
Pos, there was a lot riding on this movie    everyone even moderately interested in the   scream   series was dying to know how it would end    what would be the   final act      this is the end of an era for them   a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet   talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies   and   for kids under 17   those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into   scream   while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves    no need to worry     scream 3   is endlessly inventive and entertaining   a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name   reinvented the horror genre   and continued in the self referential   post modern tradition of quentin and co    so   how does the story go    as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe   sidney prescott   neve campbell     now all grown up and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche   is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress   but rather in upstate california   living   understandably   alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems    she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone    but that       s not where the movie starts off    instead   in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar   and conceptually horrifying   sequence in   eye for an eye     1995     cotton weary   liev schreiber     now a big star   drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls   demands the location of sidney       s home   and   when he doesn       t get it   threatens the life of cotton       s girlfriend christine   and cotton can       t do anything to stop him    the rest of the sequence is particularly clever   setting up a constant throughout the picture   the killer has a high tech electronic voice changer that tops that of the first two    not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice over artist roger jackson   ha   ha     he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters   including sidney   and the returned gale weathers   courtney cox arquette   and dewey riley   david arquette      at the same time   stab 3   the third film within a film based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college   has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro   whereas the account of the first two films was true   the franchise within   scream   has now become totally fictional    nevertheless   we learn   cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production   as himself to be killed off in the first scene    so   it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie      either the actor portraying them   or the real thing    sometimes both    clever   indeed    but   who goes next    no one knows    three different scripts were penned   we       re told   to keep the true finale off the internet   a nod to the   scream   2 fiasco a few years back   and no one knows for sure which one the killer read    still   all the while sidney stays concealed in her home   only visiting dad for the first half hour of the film   while also having horrifying visions of her mother   which takes us back a bit to sidney       s fear of becoming what her mother was      or   at least   what her mother was secretly    when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent   she       s chased onto the set of stab 3   wandering through   woodsboro     written and directed as an odd   surreal   nightmare indeed   this is one of   scream 3         s finest moments    okay   over the years   i       ll admit that i       ve become quite the   scream   fan    no   i don       t have the ghostface costume or the director       s cut laserdisc   but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo   and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films   yes   i said   dramatic element       sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with   scream      throughout the film   though   i noticed a much more subtle approach than the other two films    granted that there       s stabbin a plenty going on throughout   but there       s considerably less blood   less gore    honestly   i like this approach    it       s more classical   more rebellious   constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven    he knows when to hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze with energy   illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience    some critics have noted that   scream 3   seems to take itself more seriously this time   maybe so   or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger   arlington road     who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts   saw an opportunity for true irony      maybe even a little bit of satire      if the film worked in a few more clich     s    what puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film   i       m afraid   is the ending   or   rather   the identity of the killer    it does the job   i guess   accomplishes what it should   bringing the three films full circle   but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived   too arbitrary   after a second viewing   which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation   the killer       s identity still seems a little too random   but his motivation came across more sound this time around   and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying    all in all     scream 3   does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy   it is not the worst of the films    as a trilogy     scream   was a lot of fun   refreshing   humorous   offbeat    almost sad to see it go    but then   it does seem best to quit while you       re ahead   and   scream 3   does a fine job of providing closure to its characters    for now     scream   holds the title as the finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid    not too shabby    
Pos, this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff s play   hospitality suite     its  about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention   whose chicago company has sent them to wichita   where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel   where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna   someone named dick fuller   who is the head of a big industrial corporation    he is someone they have never met before   but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account   it is their only reason for coming to the convention       the big kahuna   revels in salesmen talk among the three white christian males   two of them   larry   spacey   and phil   devito     who are veteran salesmen   having teamed together for the last twelve years   while bob   facinelli   is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department    these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna   as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite    the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job   and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life    the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why    what comes into question is their opinions on life and death   on god and morality   and on how they make a living    these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch    their dialogue is acerbic   witty   and analytical    following in the long tradition of salesmen films    from death of a salesman   the tin men   and glengarry glen ross   as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high    in this case   it is landing the big kahuna    they each are trying to see why he s on top and why they are chasing after him    what makes this film different than the others   is its blatant religious message   comparing orthodox religion to what they do   as both must sell their product    and how after each one s psyche is stripped clean by the other   there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each    the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna   but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen    larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life    bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ    his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in    bob is a baptist   who takes a very non questioning and literal attitude about religion    to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin   according to the way he reads the bible    when asked by larry why he married his wife   he seems puzzled and can t even say because he loves her   only that marriage is something sacred to him    the contrast in their personalities is stark    larry is all business   he simply wants to close the sale    he comes into the room pumped for the convention   using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman    he criticizes phil for being so placid   for getting such a small suite   for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp   and for being burned out    he tells him to go on a vacation    get a woman    while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change   now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife   after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long    he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in    he has always been a charmer   shaking everyone s hand   trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale    larry is more aggressive as a salesman   he is always a heart attack away from every big sale    in contrast   bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him    this is his first time for him on the road    when dick fuller doesn t arrive at the party the salesmen throw   larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering    when told that he spoke to the secretary   larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account    but when they start talking to bob   whom they forced to act as the bartender   they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man s name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus    bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards   and that he invited bob to attend    larry and phil can t fathom how bob didn t make a sales pitch    but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller s attention about their company s product as they sent him off to meet fuller   and will await his return in the hotel room    these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass    the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room   as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives    these three performers were outstanding   each understanding what their role called for   each coming through with a marvelous performance    the only problem with the film   is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience    but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics   give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see    
Neg, topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil s advocate   movies that have a brilliant beginning but don t know how to end    it begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other    there is liz   who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment   prue who is getting married   geoff   liz s boyfriend   neil   her previous boyfriend   ant who has written a screenplay    for the first hour   we get to know these people through everyday activities   as they talk on the phone   go out to dinner   hang clothes on the line    the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them    at times   the events border on the ridiculous   like the screening of the film   but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives    this doesn t sound like a brilliant premise for a film     we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related     but it s the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing    unfortunately this level of honesty isn t maintained    with about half an hour to go   a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama    such a disappointment after such a brilliant start    the actors are all quite good with ms   danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive    the energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable    a lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film    it seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles    that is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock    up till that point   i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place    while the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility   it s unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film    not just the events   but also the tone of some of the end is wrong   clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it    this is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film    as stated above   the first hour is superb and even the end is above average    it just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss    
Neg, various films seen at the seattle film festival    it s all true/three men on a raft   u   s   a     1942/1986   director   orson welles  a recently uncovered one fourth of orson welle s planned   docu drama   of amazing stories around the world named it s all true   this short dealt with welle s attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft    while several clips of the film are seen   the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle s attempts to film it   despite studio problems   a staggering workload   and extremely ill fortune on the set    impressive photography   but really only interesting to film historians    sadie thompson   u   s   a     1928   director   raoul walsh screenwriter   raoul walsh   from the john colton play   rain     based on w   somerset maugham s story   miss thompson   cast   gloria swanson   raoul walsh   lionel barrymore silent  after the discussion of the newly restored version of frank capra s lost horizon   where several scenes had been restored using stills   i was interested to see sadie thompson   where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago    this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story   miss thompson      this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen  little awkwardness   and a very clever script    the actors   gloria swanson   raoul walsh   who also directed and wrote the screenplay   and especially lionel barrymore   as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie s soul   but really wants to get her between the sheets   is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel    swanson adds real life to the character   adding an worldly   affectionate air to the bawdy sadie    unfortunately   the ending is rather poorly tied up   it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live action film   or the original script    the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on   i cannot believe maugham s short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia     the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we ve been waiting an hour and a half for    still   it s entertaining right up to the end   certainly barrymore s incredibly hammy performance   which   nonetheless   works   perhaps due to the silent screen   is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells   bakkers   and robertses of the religious worlds    a c movie   worth 2   50 if you can find it    the pied piper   czechoslovakia   1986   director   jim barta screenwriter   kamil piza  this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids    it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate   and with a lot of political comment along with it    perhaps economic content is a better word  it certainly doesn t show capitalism in a good light    nor human nature   nor anything else   for that matter    as you may have guessed   this is not a tgif film   this is the kind of film you are glad is over    not that it wasn t interesting for technical reasons   this is stop animation that is very well done    all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts  except for the animated stuffed rats    boy   sounds like a real comedy vehicle   doesn t it    add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison   and you have something to give the wee ones   and some of the mentally unstable larger folk   to keep them up at night    some gore    don t bring children to this one    don t bring adults to this one   unless they re fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped    blech       no fun whatsoever    meier   west germany   1986   director/screenwriter   peter timm cast   rainier grenkowitz   nadja engelbrecht   alexander hauff   thomas besvater sub titled  this film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier   an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money    his uncle   also in the west   sneaks meier out of the country   unknown to the east germans    meier   however   is less than thrilled   his girlfriend   his friends and his job   which he likes   all exist in east germany    after a round the world trip   his boss think s he s on leave in bulgaria     meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id   and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew s work  while everyone think s he s still living in east germany    of course   something goes wrong  and the ending is very funny   but it takes the film too long to get there    the humor is spread too thin   and much of the plot is too obvious   as is the acting      still   a good concept for the comedy   and the last five minutes are pretty funny    c    $2   50    the right hand man   australia   1986   director   di drew screenplay   helen hodgman cast   rupert everett   hugo weaving   arthur dignam   jennifer claire   catherine mcclements  after a lifetime of movie going   and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival   i ve learned several rules which   while not absolute   should certainly be given deference to    1   be wary of french comedies    these people like jerry lewis    2   ken russell is never going to grow up   no matter how long you wait    3   any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as   old pouty lips   is probably not worth watching    4   when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography   watch out !  australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo   but since weir and miller left for foreign shores   finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult   not impossible  witness malcolm last year   task    well   i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night   and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards    it s as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30 s about tragedy among the gentry   and falling in love with people below your station   and horses    lots and lots of horses    the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship   which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing   because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir    unfortunately   said son   a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times   kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident    highlights include the amputation sequence   the doctor s daughter   who has the hots for the son   tasting his urine for a diagnosis   their tender kissing with a window between them   while it s raining  you d think a woman studying medicine would know better      the photography is good   but i kept wishing for b&w  everything seems sepia colored anyway    actually   i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead   but that s life    grade   z   avoid like the plague   unless you re looking for inadvertent yuks    
Neg,          because i m a scientist    that s what we do !        dr   alexander mccabe   bob gunton     in response to why he created evil bats    alright folks   stop me if you ve heard this one   genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals   assisted by a specialist in the particular animal s field   must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth    oh yeah   the military is on their way to bomb the town as well   so they are running short on time    sound familiar    such is the plot of the destination films release of bats    dina meyer stars as the   bat specialist   sheila   who is pulled from her research   along with her annoying sidekick   played with irritating deftness by leon   in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently    with the help of the local sheriff   lou diamond phillips     a cdc official   carlos jacott     and a scientist   bob gunton     sheila discovers it is indeed bats   who have been genetically altered by gunton s character to be more aggressive and omnivorous   in order to be used as a military weapon !      i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film    there s not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good    in this respect   the film never disappointed me    this film reaches a level that transcends the   so bad it s good   level and borders on the downright insane    the effects are awful   the script is contrived   and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously   i think      i challenge anyone to sit through the scene   where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner   with a straight face    thankfully   the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with    dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in   johnny mnemonic   dragonheart   and starship troopers        the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit     and this one is no exception    while one never really gets the impression that meyer s character could be a bat expert in reality   one never really cares to doubt it either    she gives as good a performance as could be expected   plus she s nice to look at for an hour and a half    lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here   as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero    although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what s going on in town   for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats    the only bad performance in the film is that of leon s    he is relegated to the   i m not sticking around here !    character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays    anyone who can t immediately tell that bob gunton   the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films   is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised   but i highly doubt it    even if he hadn t been the villain in just about every film he s ever been in   so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever    in fact   his death is welcome   because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale    if the plot doesn t sound ridiculous to you yet   then check out these little tidbits   a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol    an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor s orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated   causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force   killing several townsfolk    a government official blows off shelia s instructions   to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats  cave that will kill all of them off   by pulling a night job   resulting in the death of an entire military unit    a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it    finally   to top it all off   this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it s single screen theater   for reference   our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens   and we re lucky to even get kevin smith s dogma      the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill conceived bat puppets    while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing   making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what s going on     the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low key    therefore we the audience get loving close ups of the most unrealistic   rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film    being able to see the puppeteer s arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse    after all of this   if you still decide bats might be the movie for you   don t say you haven t been warned    trust me when i say that it s a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through    i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in    she s definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these    
Neg,    party camp     is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i ve seen in awhile    a late rip off of the   meatballs   series   the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk    that s really about all that can be said about the   plot   because nothing much happens   except that the main character   wise cracking jerry   andrew ross     has the hots for a cute blonde   kerry brennan     and there is a big contest in the climax    how fun !  since     party camp     has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved   the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative    it s not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality   but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this   the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex    even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick    at least   then   it wouldn t have been such a chore to sit through    never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat    the comedy was easy to spot   but it wasn t the least bit funny    it was groan inducing    constantly throghout   i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything    so what saves     party camp     from the dreaded zero star rating    well   that s simple   jewel shepard   as a flighty bimbo   was admittedly fun to watch    although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash   at least if the film had centered on shepard   she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid   low budget teen comedy    
Pos,    the tailor of panama   is a different kind of spy movie    despite the presence of pierce brosnan   there is nary a hint of james bond flash here    instead of big action scenes   leering super villains and empty headed femme fatales   we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation    based on the novel by john le carr     who also co wrote the screenplay   the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year   a solid   well told story    brosnan plays andy osnard   a british operative walking on thin ice    his british superiors ship him off to panama   making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement    osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co workers and his new home base    when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that   since the creation of the panama canal   the structure is the sole connection between north and south america   he barely keeps from yawning    brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007   investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end    searching for a way to get information on the government   osnard sets his sights on harry pendel   geoffrey rush     an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite    harry claims to be a transplant from britain s renowned saville row   but osnard knows his secret   the tailor is an ex con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle s shop in an insurance scam    he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt   having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm    osnard offers harry a way out    he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele    eager to comply   harry offers what he knows   then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing    before long   he is forced to spy on his loving wife   louisa   jamie lee curtis     an aide to the canal director    harry s little lies build   eventually taking on a life of their own    osnard turns in reports about the   silent opposition     a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal    the bogus revelation proves explosive   leading to meetings in washington d   c   over how to best protect the vital waterway    meanwhile   osnard wallows in his newfound status   enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co worker    and harry grows ever more fretful   fearing the consequences if his clients   not to mention his wife   learn about his lies    geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry   fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings   all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor    rush makes harry a credible figure   presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity    after gaining fame playing larger than life characters   rush flips everything around for this role   using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems    although she gets far too little screen time   jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her    of the central characters   she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self confidence    curtis is one of my favorite female actors   whiplash smart   sultry and charismatic   she deserves more than supporting roles    speaking of supporting characters   there are some great ones here    harold pinter is amusing as harry s uncle benny   who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways    also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker   who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr   strangelove school of armed patriotism    but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson   both outstanding as two wounded activists    their presence adds weight to the story   reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men   there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal    director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location    instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop   he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there    the metropolis   described by one character as   casablanca without heroes   pulsates with life   underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people       the tailor of panama   succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment    
Neg, about an hour or so into   the jackal     a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence   and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out   i hope she gets killed now !    at that point it hit me   i didn t care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn t really like    when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he s being played by sidney poitier   you know something s rotten in the state of denmark    every year   a couple films like this are released    you know   the cheap   action packed international espionnage film   featuring a semi promising premise   some big name actors   usually bruce willis     and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago    this was the third one of  97   following the very lackluster   the saint     which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe   and the surprisingly fun   the peacemaker     featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain       the jackal   tries to mix both elements    and you thought   the saint   was bad       the jackal   is loosely   very loosely   i hope   based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i ve yet to see     the day of the jackal     which featured   apparently   a suave hitman called the jackal   played by edward fox   trying to assasinate charles degaule    well   welcome to the 90s   where a sorta suave hitman   also called the jackal   bruce willis     trying to kill the head of the fbi       or  is he    after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother   killed in the opening scenes     the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere   from helsinki to virginia   setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he ll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion    and like the saint   the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people    the agent working on the case   cater preston   sidney poitier   yes   that sidney poitier     working with a russian agent   valentina koslova   diane venora   lady capulet from   romeo + juliet       gives up early on and meets with an ex ira man   declan mulqueen   richard gere   putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of  97   who s in a massachusetts jail   but who has apparently seen the jackal   who has been eluding the law forever    soon   he s out working with the two untrusting agents   and trying to help them catch him    there are numerous problems with the film   and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on    the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller   but save a couple moments   the film never achieves suspense   or even a sense of intrigue    sure   the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense   but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register    the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience   or even an entertaining one    it doesn t help that the plot is designed to be complex   but falls into so many problems   like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances    the script of   the jackal   is a complete mess   mostly because it can t decide what it wants to focus on    is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer    is it a film about a nasty   amoral hitman who s in everything for the money    or is it a combination of both       the jackal   aims for the latter   but never focuses in on either character    the connection between the two feels completely edited   so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan   you wonder how he recognized him so fast    the worst part is the little past they try to give declan   most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend   isabella   mathilda may     given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then    the supporting characters are worse    sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role   that of a man who is just stern sometimes   and other times more giving and likable    what is poitier doing here    he s one of the best living actors !  does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this    diane venora s russian character is almost as bad   with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth   and a plastered on expressionless facade    it s not that anyone s bad here   it s that they have nothing to do    the plot is a joke   feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time    the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain    there are several times where he s in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself   the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill    take a scene where he s being followed by some agents into a parking garage   he quickly sprays his car another color   and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it    doesn t killing someone attract more attention than it does distract    and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place    geez !  is there anything good here    well       a  couple things    i did like willis s icy expressions   he may not have been real suave or anything   but some of his looks are worth a chuckle    richard gere has a couple of good moments   making his character as likable as he possibly could have    and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous   completely inane but fun kinda way   most notably   a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder   jack black     and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man   which has its share of a couple good jokes   most particular a kiss by willis    but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go   they re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is   the jackal      director michael caton jones   who directed the far superior   rob roy     has made a film that is made very couple months   one that is unentertaining   unintriguing   and pretty much cold   but will nevertheless make money because   hey   the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro clancy kinda way    every now and then   the filmmakers get it right     clear and present danger     which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way     but   the jackal   is an example of when they go completely wrong    
Neg, boy   what a great movie ! !  keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together   the director of the fugitive   andrew davis   back again to give us another thriller   and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot    how could this not be a blockbuster    all die hard keanu reeves fans   read on    ol   much ado about nothing   plays eddie kasalivich   a machinist studying at the university of chicago    to help pay for the rent   he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university    by happy coincidence   he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics    this project holds great promise   taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in    a potential solution to the earth s energy problems without the pollution cost    surely nobody could have any problems with that    morgan freeman is paul shannon   the project s sponsor    he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public    he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly    so he murders the project leader   blows up the project   great but short scene here   sort of like a mini id4 city devastation thing   and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi tech hush hush location    unfortunately   our intrepid machinist and an english physicist   weisz   manage to get away and now follows a fugitive like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script    this movie is just dying for a comparison with   the fugitive      both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn t change much   i guess we can t really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere    the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones   chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward    credit to them   but we aren t really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters    where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy   eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves  character is never given the time to develop    it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences   which frankly   get quite boring after a while    harrison ford was   the man against the world      he was alone in a world where he didn t know who to trust and it came across real well    in chain reaction   keanu reeves isn t alone    now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia   vulnerability and confusion    we don t get this    we get him thinking he s still in speed   only now our sandra bullock has an english accent   probably doesn t drive a bus   and hardly contributes anything to the movie    the producers here probably thought     hey   what if keanu and rachel don t hit it off too well    let s rope in that morgan to help us out      well   keanu and rachel didn t hit it off well on the screen   and most unfortunately   morgan freeman doesn t help much either    the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder    it s not really his fault    once again   andrew davis just doesn t take the time to build his characters    someone must have convinced him that this time round   cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken    the flying inkpot rating system   * wait for the tv2 broadcast     * * a little creaky   but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good   bring a friend     * * * * amazing   potent stuff     * * * * * perfection    see it twice    
Pos, capsule   the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi day festivities    mira nair s film is pleasant enough with a little human drama   a few family secrets   some sadness and some happiness    you have seen it all before   but perhaps not from india    the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable       low +2    4 to +4    mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala    her newest film   written by sabrina dhawan   is very similar to previous films like betsy s wedding but it is set in new delhi    a wealthy family is having a wedding    an indian wedding is a multi day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial    even more than in the us   it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get together    the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members  individual story lines    aditi verma is marrying hemant   an indian engineer working in the us    she had previously had a relationship with vikram   her supervisor    latit   her father   played by naseeruddin shah     is juggling many problems   not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey    dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration    even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice   one of the family servants    several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex   family secrets   or both    there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love    some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films    western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna    on the other hand it was not clear   to me at least   if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films    this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english    the latter will   however   help with an international release    sabrina dhawan s screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog    we have seen films with plotting very much like this   but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference    director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life    i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the  4 to +4 scale    
Neg, contrary to popular belief   not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece    some of them aren t even good    some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful   un indien dans la ville     presented as   little indian   big city     and remade into that crap tim allen flick     jungle2jungle       and this    what could have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick       french twist     the   cool   american title   not the real one   which was   gazon maudit     literally meaning   twisted ground     or something like that   deals with a married couple with kids   and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them    loli and alain chabat   victoria abril and alain chabat   are not exactly happily married    always on business trips   alain chabat more than once cheats on her   and she eventually finds out    and one day   she meets a butch mechanic   marijo   the co writer/director josiane balasko     and they two kinda hit it off    so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious   sleeping with marijo    but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo   but she s also realizes she s still in love with alain chabat    so   of course   she does the obvious from that   she decides to keep them both    she ll be   and sleep   with each of them for 3 days each   then on sunday   she ll rest by herself    after all   she needs it if she s gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel    the film goes on for over an hour and a half   through stupidity after stupidity   moronic twist after moronic twist   and soon there s the little ironic   ! ! !    ending    i know it s a completely different culture   and i m quite familiar with the french and their cinema   but this is just bad    none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in   fargo     a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point     and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience    what s shocking is this was not only one of france s biggest hits   but it was nominated for a lot of cesars   french equivalent of oscars      the writing and directing is really the big problem with it    josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role   but her little sex comedy isn t very humerous   entertaining   or even deep at all    even woody allen s not very good   a midsummer night s sex comedy   is intelligent   well written   and possesses some depth    this is shallow   unfunny   and pretty annoying to watch    the film moves at the pace of a snail   and is damn near painful to watch    thank god for the fast forward button    the acting   however   isn t bad at all    the actors do the best they can with the bad material   and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script   and the fact that she s stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids      and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband    but   french twist   is just pretty lame    it s not overly horrible   and has a couple very   very   very brief moments    but it s just a really crap film   and an example of an ill advised distribution of a foreign film    
Pos, i know that   funnest   isn t a word       fun   is a noun   and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective    but that s the word that came to me right after viewing   chicken run      no wonder   this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions   like   that was the funnest movie i ve ever seen !    so to hell with webster s      chicken run   is one of the funnest movies i ve seen in a while    i can t remember the last time i ve seen anything funner    the chickens at tweedy s farm are up to something    living in a concentration camp like atmosphere   they are led by one plucky hen called ginger   voice of julia sawalha   who continually comes up with plans for escape    and always gets caught   subsequently spending day after day in the coal box    one night   a brash american rooster flies in over the fence   calling himself rocky   mel gibson     famous flying rooster and circus performer    rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly   and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs   tweedy   miranda richardson   decides to abandon the farm s egg selling plan for a pie selling plan    she orders a huge pie making machine   cackling     chickens go in   pies come out      what sort of pies    chicken pies   of course    co director nick park and his studio   aardman animation   produced three oscar winning short films     creature comforts       the wrong trousers     and   a close shave      the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit   a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures    part of what made the   wallace   films brilliantly entertaining was park s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new       the wrong trousers     for example   pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks   and   a close shave   owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories    but in the hands of park and his team   the stories felt fresh and inspired   and not the least bit contrived    now teaming with co director peter lord   park has created a similar creature in   chicken run      the plot is largely lifted from   the great escape     watch for a quick reference to the ball bouncing scene     with some spielberg inspired action sequences providing the excitement    thing is   the film doesn t feel like it s been lifted from somewhere else     chicken run   feels fresh   alive   like nothing else ever done    part of it is the original idea   who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners of war movie starring chickens    park and lord milk the incongruity for all it s worth   the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious   and to them   it is    but they re * chickens *   so it s funny to us    another thing that helps   chicken run     and most of park s films   succeed is the animators  subtle way of giving nods to the very films they re cribbing    there are references to   the great escape     obviously   and   stalag 17      the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both   raiders of the lost ark   and   indiana jones and the temple of doom      there s even a nod to   the blues brothers     if you can believe it   and the filmmakers even get in a little light hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor   taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson s nationality and film history    the   braveheart   reference is a hoot if you catch it    when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one     chicken run   is downright brilliant in its execution    consider this   since july of last year   i ve seen dozens upon dozens of   blair witch project   parodies   on television   on the radio   and online    out of all those   maybe one or two were amusing   the rest tiresome    why    because once you got past the thought that   they re parodying that&#8216   blair witch  movie     most of the parodies had nothing to offer    no insight   no original idea   no greater purpose    they were only funny if you had seen the movie   otherwise   you got nothing    conversely     chicken run   doesn t lean on its parodies    the film references are never the sole focus of any scene    if you ve never seen   indiana jones     the chase sequence is still fun    even if you have no idea who mel gibson is   rocky remains an interesting character    park   lord   and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it s understood   and as a result     chicken run   is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious   but not quite vague either    enjoyment of this movie doesn t require knowledge of film history   but if you ve got it     chicken run   is that much richer    the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances   and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it s hard not to fall in love with every one of them    ginger is perfect   spunky and opinionated   but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind   and julia sawalha   known as the cute mousy girl on   absolutely fabulous     nails it    she has warm   human chemistry with gibson   whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung ho veneer    the characters  inevitable romance doesn t feel contrived   but sweet    poor mr   tweedy   tony haygarth   suspects the chickens are organizing in some way   but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out   and his overbearing wife certainly isn t any help    jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs   a hen that runs away with most of the best one liners   all while perpetually crocheting a sweater     and two supply trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing dancing sequence    they even come up with an inspired riff on something that s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades   the chicken vs   egg dilemma    one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome   but as with most of   chicken run     it comes as a delightful surprise    the film manages to cross all barriers   it should be accessible to both children and adults   brits and yanks   rats and chickens    the animation is first rate    remember that this was all done the old fashioned way   with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit   and you see just how truly remarkable   chicken run   really is    this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios  animation great   precise and unwavering attention to detail    as in such top notch family fare as   a bug s life   or   toy story 2       chicken run   has something to offer in nearly every frame    certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes   but a active   attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the details    anyway   the movie s just a boatload of fun    funnest damn movie i ve seen all year    
Pos, i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x files    first   let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie    the producers are not stupid   making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable    you have to reach for a larger audience    therefore   the movie is quite user friendly    altough   non fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange    but fear not   duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on    you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera    in any case   the answer is no    i am not a fan of the x files   i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium    however   since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie    i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie   i am glad to report that i learned nothing new    everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others    i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie    warning   major spoilers follow !  please do not read to fully enjoy this movie   you must not be able know what is coming   what exactly is over that hill and what that weird   hummm   sound is all about    you have been warned    the x files is what a summer should be    exciting   scary   great special effects   unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary   and good performances    this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank    from start to finish   this movie does not let go of you    when i compare it with last summer s movies the best way to describe it would be   take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon    this flick is scary   not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes    in fact   the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue    you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd !  the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid    you know   when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair   or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt    so yeah   the x files is scary    and guess what    you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed   computer generated   babyzilla   it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster    do not think that the x files is a monster movie    in fact   the creature is there for maybe three minutes total    no   the x files is definately a mulder episode of the series    scully is at his side   of course   but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time    she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny   but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much    no   this is mulder s time in the spotlight    by now   you have heard of the scene where mulder   showers   independence day    if you have not then i will not spoil it for you   let s just say that due to recent events mulder should be   showering   godzilla instead    to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there       who  cares !    if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about    the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous    the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill    the script is spotless   every thing that happens happens for a purpose    if you are confused by something   do not worry because it will all become clear later on but   and i cannot stress this enough   pay attention ! ! !  unlike most summer movies   the dialogue is twice as important as the effects    miss one vital piece of information and   like most people who talk during movies   you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense    also   to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies       don t !  the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation    there is no time to take a breather between scenes because   again unlike most summer movies   godzilla anybody       the x files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots   every scene is crucial and serves a purpose    who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a   big emotional scene   between godzilla attacks    so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose    but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie   the x files is    what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited    cool effects    it s got some    pulse pounding    hell yes !  strangely enough   i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non fans will have a good time    it does not provide answers to the show s many questions   the status quo remains nearly the same and   no   mulder and scully do not get together    rating   four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer   several jump right out of your seat thrills   many   whoah   i never saw that one coming !    moments   four   holy shit   where the hell did that come from   and one heck of an ending    you may wonder where this movie lost half a star    well   i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck   the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop    it s pretty obvious the film s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time   but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving    
Pos, it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare   the best movie of the year would be a summer vehicle   a jim carrey vehicle at that    and so it is     the truman show  is the most perplexing   crazed   paranoid and rib tickling morality play i ve seen since i don t know when    don t credit carrey    it starts with andrew niccol   gattaca     who created the script ten years ago    the story   replete with sublte religious and philisophical undertones   is about a man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience       ironically   it was within these past ten years that   reality based   television have become a predominant fixture into our culture    who knew      one upping niccol   it was when unlikely candidate director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place    weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone   deftly mixing capra with kafka   throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling    it was weir s first stroke of genius to create seahaven   a suburban paradise/prison that would make spielberg cower in shame    for example   bystander extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of  dog fancy     the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to  not  leave the island    credit weir for his second stroke   the casting of carrey    carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn   on   and act goofy whenever the camera is near    not here    his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on    and although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination   just as well   the academy rarely honors goofy comedians   excepting robin williams     he stretches enough to alter his hyper silly image considerably    playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey s life    no pun intended    better in a smaller   more pivotal role is ed harris as christof   who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13   work the problem   people   character with dustin hoffman s megaglomaniac producer in  wag the dog    and then only slightly svengalian    it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and truman s well being    yes   in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son   and has provided the best universe he could provide    he thinks    rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone   mrs    dalloway   as carrey s true   forbidden love     sylvia   very effective in another pivotal small role    laura linney   congo   and noah emmerich   copland   have the unfortunate task of playing truman s wife and best friend   their sitcom ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development    the exception is at the very beginning   where they speak into the camera   wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman   and for society in general    there are other little problems with the script    are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years    was there any reason as to why in one scene   it rained solely on truman   even though it never had to    how is it they hire hundreds of extras   and none of them could drive a boat   and yet truman   fearful of water   is helming a sailboat effortlessly    and couldn t christof have turned off the wind   to strand truman at sea    these little contrivances   however   do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work    the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show   and we are drawn to truman s mundane existence for no other reason than it is there    the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut    upon leaving the theater   i was looking up in the sky   wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome    just checking    
Pos, known as the most successful   highest grossing romantic comedy in history   director garry marshall apparently struck gold with   pretty woman     which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but   thanks to positive word of mouth   was able to reach upwards of $175 million in theaters alone    the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film s two charismatic stars   richard gere and julia roberts   since the story itself is none too original or even believable    the other winning element that makes   pretty woman   so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence   which is rarely as palpable in today s films as it is here    edward lewis   richard gere   is a suave   extremely wealthy business mogul who   at the start of the picture   breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument   and abruptly takes his friend s car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel    stopping the car along the street   he asks a woman   obviously a prostitute   for directions    agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks   edward ultimately accepts   they strike up a conversation   and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor    this meeting does not lead to sex   however   as edward confides that he d rather just have someone to talk to   and offers her $300 to spend the night    just as well   since the hooker   named vivian   is a beautiful   generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear    the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned   when edward finally offers to pay vivian three thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area   keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get togethers    since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips   which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers   the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act   edward and vivian will finally   truly   kiss    allegedly planned as a grim   downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director     pretty woman   has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale   a la   cinderella      the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been    you honestly don t need a high iq   or any iq   for that matter   to guess how the film will end   and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha    the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less than gratifying   and the screenplay is no award winner    and yet   amidst all of these qualms and flaws     pretty woman   is an astoundingly charming motion picture   and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers    you d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go   and there are a few select moments   not even whole scenes   mind you   that are as romantic as anything i ve seen on film in the 1990 s    additionally   the film belongs   and its success can be attributed   to two people and two people only   and they are richard gere and julia roberts    playing sex symbols throughout the  80s with such pictures as   american gigolo   and   an officer and a gentleman     gere branches out here to play a more quiet   almost shy   but still alluring   character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet   and vice versa    julia roberts   in her breakthrough role after 1988 s well received   mistic pizza   and 1989 s   steel magnolia     for which she was nominated for an academy award   is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian   who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers   not for her line of work   but more for her sheer intelligence    it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake   but screenwriter j   f   lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing    after   pretty woman     roberts   along with meg ryan   became the reigning queen of romantic comedies   with her latest being the just released   runaway bride     which repairs gere and roberts together once again     and no wonder    roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy   but also one who can efficiently do drama   and in almost every film she appears in   it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co star    an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co workers that vivian is actually a prostitute   and he then approaches her   making sexual advances    no only does this make vivian feel cheap   especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional   eloquent young lady   but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way   and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading   and if she likes this particular path    on the more dreamy side   the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold   especially one in which edward enters into the hotel s lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress   but also her inner   and outer   glowing beauty    another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward   who is asleep   and placing it on his lips   since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days       pretty woman   does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene   which is a happy ending   as you d expect   and wouldn t have it any other way   that somehow does not work   perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances    this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film   though   because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem    helped along by a warm   memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo   as vivian s best friend and roommate   and a fabulously catchy soundtrack   in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie s overall fulfillment     pretty woman   is a sparkler of a motion picture   and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy    
Neg, note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    at the end of the day   those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros   made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere    this highly anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening   where it would have gone head to head against the rival studios  heavy hitters   its eventual demotion to a less potent mid august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio s lack of confidence with the picture    and with good reason    this is a joyless exercise of a film   held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement   thrills or wit    remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving   the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year s case study in style over substance   joel schumacher s much loathed batman & robin       indeed   both films even feature appalling   ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes      uma thurman   who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit clad   karate chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg   was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster   imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage    unfortunately   the same can t be said here   where she and cohort ralph fiennes   our new john steed   taking over for patrick macnee   demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever   fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they re on board a sinking ship    at this rate   usually splendid actor mr   fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man    his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days    the duo * look * the part    and admittedly the avengers is   more than most   heavily dependent upon style    but they re no fun to watch   and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture s caper esque plot    when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat   i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs   peel    no   not kate beckinsale   although the notion now intrigues me     but gwyneth paltrow   who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot on english accent    if nothing else   it d at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt    the story   such as it is   involves the ever bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter   sean connery     an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate controlling contraption       they also sip a lot of tea      overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists  superiors   it sounds far better than it plays   and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post production tinkering   it s clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds    the avengers was never about gripping drama   and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously   but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac   it s all decidedly uncompelling    mr   connery   who s onscreen barely long enough to register an impression   approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation   simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest    at least it all looks good    this is a genuinely handsome production   with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt    in particular   the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention   adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain    there are a handful of striking visual moments in the film   including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water   but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates    by the time the film s climax had arrived   my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain   but with the quickest escape route from the theatre    not coincidentally   the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie s remarkable trailer   a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself   the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year    it s everything that the avengers is not    saucy   clever   engaging   and entertaining    a crushing disappointment   the film is one of the worst outings of the year    too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad   too polished to overlook its deficiencies    there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers   but i sure hope not

Neg,    america s sweethearts   has an intriguing premise and a great cast   but it isn t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be    almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co script writer billy crystal   who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co hosting   comic relief   charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg   two other paragons of self indulgence      crystal ignores a simple   but crucial   rule   for a screwball comedy to work   the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting   because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous       america s sweethearts   takes place at a press junket   where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters    it s a promising set up   but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules   thus dissipating the tension of the situation    by the end of the film   all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on   but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed    john cusack and catherine zeta jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison

effectiveness    press junkets are a haven for control freaks    studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel   with food and drink always at hand    generally   on the evening of their arrival   writers are bussed to see the featured film   then ferreted straight back to the hotel    the next day   writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews    every 30 minutes or so   a producer   director   writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions   with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things    the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression   writers are free to ask what they want   but understand that if the studio dislikes a question   they may not be invited to future junkets    representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions    they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew   with the studio filming the exchanges    the   reporters   are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars   but to play it safe   the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs    placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired   but the screenplay undermines the conceit    the junket is moved from the handsome   but highly confining   four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas    for most of the film   the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds   completely safe from the eyes of the press    when they do deal with journalists   the   it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters   premise is de clawed    gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll   they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and   at the screening of the movie   everyone connected with the film goes nuts   all without any repercussions    lee certainly isn t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts   in fact   he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids    is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors    hell no   they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie    all of which underscores how billy crystal and co writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise   the comedy in   america s sweethearts   is based on barely in control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters   except that it doesn t matter because any publicity is good publicity    and thus the very set up for the film implodes   leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter    so what about the cast    julia roberts   at her best playing the underdog   is utterly charming here   although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit   and not a very convincing one   by the way      catherine zeta jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic    by casting himself as the publicist   billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on   comic relief     stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks    in supporting roles   hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed   too broad      seth green is amusing as a toadie   stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair   though he has little to work with    come to think of it     little to work with   is the operative phrase for this movie    as a hollywood satire     america s sweethearts   is toothless    as a romance   it is at best a minor pleasure    such a good cast   such a waste of their efforts    had it not been taken long ago   a better title for the film would have been   much ado about nothing      
Pos,    living out loud     is the type of motion picture we don t often see   it is a film about mature   intelligent adults   instead of the usual american film   in which children basically dress up in grown up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven year olds    judith   holly hunter     a fortysomething living in new york city   has been having a difficult time with life lately    she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband   martin donovan     who had been cheating on her    she cannot sleep   haunted by terrible memories   often imagines off the wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place   and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers   liz bailey   queen latifah     perform at a local club    judith s life does start to brighten a little when   one night when she gets home to her apartment late   strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator   pat   danny devito     a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently    both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other   seeking comfort with the other person   but while pat starts to form a deep love for her   judith only wants to remain friends       living out loud     which was written by richard lagravenese     the bridges of madison county       who is also making his directing debut here   is a wonderful film from beginning to end   one that is honest   genuinely funny   and poignant    the three central characters   that of judith   pat   and liz   are all written to be free thinking   complex human beings   and are all likable   but flawed   people who are constantly interesting   as is the film itself    one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen    sometimes it results in comedy   and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching    one sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself   reading a novel    an older woman comes over to her   mentions that that is a great book she is reading   and then goes over to join her own friends    as the woman sits down   she looks over to see judith by herself   and motions for her to come join them    instantly   we realize this was simply in judith s mind   as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends    holly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here    hunter   of course   was brilliant in 1993 s   the piano     for which she won an academy award   but in this film she is even better   i think    she finds the right note for each scene and holds it    and devito has never had such a humanistic role before   which i was surprised about    usually he is used as the butt of a joke   or as a caricature   but in this film   has a living and breathing   sympathetic person to play    topping it all off is latifah   also a singer   who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself   and has a juicy   natural supporting role as   in some ways   judith s role model    another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived     happy   ending   but   in staying with its realistic tone   manages to be upbeat   but truthful    the last shot is an especially powerful image    nothing is said   but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all    the relationship that results between judith and pat is true to life and sincere    as we watch these two people talk   and get to know each other   all that we wish for them both is to be happy   even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved    and as     living out loud     which is one of the best films of the year   proves   sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for

Neg, breakdown is an moderately entertaining   if underwhelming   thriller    kurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor   taking the scenic route to california through redneck country    however   while in the middle of nowhere   their jeep decides to break down   leaving them stranded    a friendly truck driver   warren   walsh     offers to give them a lift to town    although jeff rejects the offer   he wants to stay with his car     amy agrees   hops into warren s lorry   and promptly disappears    jeff wonders where the hell she is   and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life   the plot thickens and jeff goes on a chase to find his wife    although comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance   1972   and the vanishing   1993   plot wise   the latter two are far superior character and script wise    kurt russell is o   k as jeff   although he can seemingly only pull of one expression   which is angry    throughout the whole film   he looks angry   or just pissed off      quinlan is o   k again   but again she can only pull off one expression   which is looking dorky    throughout the whole film   she looks dorky    j   t walsh   who   sadly   recently passed away   is fine as warren   who we soon find out is a kidnapper   although his actual character is pretty weak   and not really menacing enough    the supporting cast do their best aswell   with rex linn as a doubting sheriff   and the other kidnappers    the story   written by first timer jonathan mostow   who also directs   is o   k   if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid    some of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy    there are some flaws with the plot also   as the characters do the complete opposite to logical   presumably to keep the story  exciting    and also the fact that the story just isn t strong enough to sustain the audience s attention    the picture moves along very slowly also    it almost threatens to drop dead    the picture does pick up towards the end   but by then it s too late    mostow directs the action sequences well enough   however    the film doesn t really come to a satisfying conclusion   either    the ending tries to be bleak   but just comes off annoying    breakdown could of been a far more enjoyable picture had it had a stronger cast and director    instead   it just turns out to be merely average    a missed opportunity    overall rating= review by david wilcock  
Neg, cradle will rock is the latest effort from director/actor tim robbins    while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995   dead man walking     he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here    the story is confusing   and filled with many subplots   so i ll try my best and explain it as simply as possible    the film is based on a   mostly   true story about a federal theater in the 1930s   that produced a play   the cradle will rock   that apparently was offensive to some   so the government shuts it down    it s during the time of the depression   and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs   or are poor    between this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots   about those who work in theater   or those associated    also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience    tim robbin s just keeps piling on political views   and characters   that we just give up on the film   or in some cases walk out    for robbin s it may be a nice achievement   but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue   and fancy outfits    i thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast   unfortunately are all uninteresting   except for a few    let me recap what each important character does   so please bear with me   it s the least you can do   especially if you were considering seeing this      i ll begin with those involved with the play    there s orson welles   angus macfadyen   who of course is the director of the play   the producer john houseman   cary elwes     marc blitzstein   hank azaria   the writer of the play   emily watson   a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock    outside the play there s the   ventriloquist   bill murray   who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk   joan cusack     another subplot involving a painter diego rivera   ruben blades   who s unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage   john cusack      there s a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories   susan sarandon   philip baker hall too name a few   but those that i mentioned   were the most significant to the story    anyway   most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted   except for emily watson   who does another great job   and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack   who always delivers through thick and thin    now although most of the film was weak to say the least   there were some nice moments and some involving subjects   but all this is overblown    sure the free speech segment was a nice feature   but not when it becomes repetitive    the whole film is like this   and it s basically nothing but a headache    on the brighter side   tim robbin s direction was masterful    his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson s latest magnolia   only smoother in my opinion   but even that can t make a movie that much better    although it has it s moments   not many of them   but they re there     cradle will rock stays true to it s title   because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over    
Neg, director doug ellin s kissing a fool   released earlier this year   is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story    like a sitcom with jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laugh track on it   the movie meanders along insulting the viewers  intelligence in almost every frame    the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines you ve heard before         i m not wearing any underwear     the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster   max   in what she assumes will be a sure fire come on line      max   chicago s biggest playboy   decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam   short for samantha    max and sam possess two irritating personalities   and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience    max is played without any style by david schwimmer    schwimmer   whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality   makes an unlikely lover    his costar   mili avital as sam   is cut from the same cloth   so they can be argued to be a matched pair    after all   people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other   ditto for similar looks   so why shouldn t the personality challenged be attracted    the implausible plot has max asking his best friend   jay   jason lee     to hit on sam as a test    jay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him   but stop short of the actual act    max   being promiscuous by nature   worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does    the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work    neither the script nor the actors make this test believable       the 64   000 question is   how do you know you re with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life      jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film    finally   there is the film s attempt at physical comedy    jay s ex girlfriend natasha   vanessa angel   becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else    natasha rips jay s shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa    as she throws her hair on his bare chest   she demands he pull it    this is supposed to be funny    most films have some saving grace    some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture wasn t    kissing a fool   on the other hand   has nothing to recommend it    kissing a fool runs 1   45    it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers

Pos, like the wonderful 1990 drama     awakenings     starring robin williams and robert de niro     at first sight     directed by irwin winkler   is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight     directed by irwin winkler   is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks    since   awakenings   was so very good   and made my top ten list the year it was released     at first sight   is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall   but is still an intelligent and vibrantly acted drama    the film begins as amy   mira sorvino     a stressed out new york architect   decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country    at the hotel she is staying at   she makes a massage appointment and after a long   soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions   she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil   val kilmer     only to find out later that he is actually blind    amy doesn t really care if he has a handicap or not   and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love    once she has returned to new york   amy begins to research on virgil s certain type of retinal blindness   which he has had since three years of age   and out of a stroke of luck   comes into contact with a doctor   bruce davison   who believes he can repair virgil s sight   even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history    at first reluctant   virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery   much to the hesitance of his overbearing   but loving older sister   kelly mcgillis      ultimately   the surgery is a success   but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees   since he has never visually seen anything before   only touched objects    he moves into amy s apartment and she is eager to stand by him   but virgil s maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship    on the basis of the overall story     at first sight   is indeed a film that has been done many times before   and owes a great deal to its predecessor     awakenings      what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance    however   what helps   at first sight   rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy    usually   romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy dog sort   the recent tom hanks/meg ryan starrer   you ve got mail   immediately pops to mind     but with this film   i grew to care more about the characters and their plight    the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil    the massaging sequences were strangely erotic   maybe even more so than the later actual   love scenes     and as their romantic involvement quickly developed   the film was both entertaining and sweet   and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two    these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known   with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting   peaceful life in the country to amy s eventful life in the   big city      the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board    val kilmer   usually cast in the   macho   type of role   was always believable as a blind person   and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears    it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity   but to sympathize with   and he pulled it off    mira sorvino   who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995 s hilarious woody allen comedy     mighty aphrodite     for which she won a well deserved oscar as a kind hearted   but ditzy hooker   is a standout here    although she has made some mediocre film choices since then   1997 s   mimic     1998 s   the replacement killers       she always has managed to come out unscathed   and it is with   at first sight   that she finally has another juicy role to play    in a truthful climactic scene set in amy s apartment between she and virgil   sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today   and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces    kelly mcgillis   who could have easily come off as the   bad     one dimensional sister   instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother    finally   nathan lane   who is usually a little too over the top   is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist    the one misstep of   at first sight   is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil    very little is ever said or discussed concerning it   and when the surgery occurs   it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes    perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences   but i would personally take realism   even if it is graphic   any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder    in   awakenings     the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed    because of how strong the screenplay   written by steve levitt   is in the way it deals with the main relationship   and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino   the film s few problems can be swept over to the side    the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is   no doubt   in respect to the real life couple that the film was inspired by   who are still together after many years   even though the setting of the film was changed to new york      since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies     at first sight   comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace    
Pos, martin scorsese s films used to intimidate me    because of his reputation   i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks    as much as i enjoyed them   i usually felt like i missed something    i learned from scorsese s casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story    no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies    for example   in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other    there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on    or toward the end   when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building    again   the simple   mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing    i don t mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good looking    but he simply uses the best tool for the job    it shouldn t have surprised me   then   that kundun   a film about a mystical religion   actually turned out to be quite straightforward    the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama   the spiritual and political leader of tibet    the movie s title is another name for the dalai lama which means   ocean of wisdom      his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story       one of which makes an interesting statement   pay attention to the film s opening shot and watch where it is repeated      we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old    his curiosity and self assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama    a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before    several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items    the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own    the boy picks correctly   proving that he is the new   and the old   dalai lama    scorsese and long time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk    before selecting an item   he would look at the monk   perhaps for some sort of confirmation    sometimes he picked right the first time   and sometimes he made a second choice    either way   whether through reincarnation or quick human perception   the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise   perceptive leader    >from this point on   the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama s spirit and the future leader of a nation    it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child    in the u   s   it might be grounds for a call to social services    but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage    neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable   well rounded person    certain patterns take shape over the years    for example   the dalai lama is fascinated by technology    radios   clocks   and telescopes are some of his favorite toys    when he is old enough to accept his leadership   he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet    he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain   including herd animals    it s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter    but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet s gigantic neighbor   china    tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china   as   first the propaganda   then the political pressure   and finally the armies   come across their common border    the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama s life is in danger if he stays    the movie ends when   after much agonizing   the dalai lama leaves tibet for india    the story doesn t lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do    it just doesn t fit that mold    if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie   perhaps more like seven years in tibet   which is good in its own right      the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that    the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events   not vice versa    perhaps because the pace is slower   we have more time to notice the beautiful art   vestments   and architecture of tibet    a mandala     tibetan sand painting   with beautiful   vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie    the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold    the bricks are a rich reddish brown   not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans    even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie   which is usually light blue   is the red and gold of tibet    philip glass composed the music for kundun   and he was the perfect choice    for those who don t know of glass   his music is like a tibetan mandala    his building blocks are lots of small notes   tiny grains of music   which are first grouped   then repeated in patterns    these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition    people won t be flocking to kundun for it s great ending   or talking about its outstanding plot   but it does have a lot to offer   an interesting lifetime   exotic sights   rich cinematography   and innovative music    it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person    on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese   who gives the film a strong   beautiful   consistent look    
Pos, on re watching italian writer/director dario argento s much lauded murder mystery tenebrae   i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with    in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles   but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his   giallo   murder mysteries    while it s certainly not perfect   repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller    the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal   anthony franciosa   where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book   tenebrae      with the police on his back for leads   he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems    the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa    he brings grace   charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real life horror around him    the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension    argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral   ambivalent   shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business    tenebrae is perhaps the most multi layered of argento s scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here    it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play    in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso   the full length italian language version   and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes    needless to say for argento fans   there is no denying the director s brilliance as a stylist    many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork    they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light   rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria    instead   tenebrae s set design and lighting paints a sleek   clinical   chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world    and the soundtrack s mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment    so tenebrae has much to recommend it   no question    still   constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative    some critics argue that logic doesn t matter in argento films   but damnit   it matters in all films to the point where viewers don t deserve to feel cheated    by the way   if you don t want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs    about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which   properly handled   could have proved ingenious    we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who   we later discover   is none other than the author peter neal    he is insane   apparently    the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it s time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife    he is finally revealed to us as this   second killer   in the film s bloody climax    but argento muffs the twist   both technically and narratively    you see   we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer s house    but thanks to poor editing   its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway    bad cutting puts the timing way out    in other words   he s almost in two places at once    during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring    by the film s end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant    the injury    he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock !  thus   the revelation of the   hero   as a killer   and anti hero   in the final scenes may still prove shocking   but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled    helpfully   in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along    but there too is a problem   as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least    the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa s mind   his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage    tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies    for instance   a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike    we would assume the rider is the same boy   but it turns out to be some male character we aren t even introduced too !  that s careless filmmaking   pure and simple    why   you may ask   do i go on about the story s flaws    because when it comes to visuals and set pieces   argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world    take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae    an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where   almost unbelievably   it jumps a high fence and chases her across town    finally   as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine   she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer s lair    it s an absolutely masterful sequence   tense and exciting   and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone    and that s exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating    too often   it seems   argento s films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts    mind you   if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look    and if you re a fan of argento s unique style of giallo thriller then it s essential    see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli    it s a stylish   great looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative    a shame   because it doesn t have to be that way    take argento s more recent stendhal syndrome   1992     where with the aid of co writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache    proof that he can do it   if he tries        
Neg, one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton s 1925 silent film seven chances    now i ve never seen seven chances   as i m more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan   but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this    o donnell plays jimmie shannon   the manager of a pool table manufacturing company    he also fears commitment   and despite dating anne   renee zellweger   for over three years   he s unwilling to marry her    his reasons    well he s a guy you see   and well   guys are like stallions   and they apparently don t like to be roped or something   hey   that s the movie s explanation        i d marry renee zellweger in a second      eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose   and when he does   it s the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever    he essentially says to her     you win   and hands her a ring    the audience should now hate this character    i did    then the meat of the plot presents itself    jimmie s grandfather   peter ustinov   completely wasted   dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business    however   in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers   jimmie must be married before his next birthday   which is just over 24 hours away      having blown his chances with anne   jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a   business proposition      the movie wasn t half bad by this time   surprisingly    it wasn t boring me   and even managed to read my thoughts at one point    ustinov s character left a video will   and while he s reading the ridiculous clause in it   i thought to myself   what is this   brewster s millions        as soon as i thought it   hal holbrook s character actually says   what is this   brewster s millions      it was quite surreal    something happens though during the film s final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive    up to that point   all of jimmie s prior girlfriends had turned down his   business proposition   which i felt was good    at least the film wasn t painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers    when jimmie has no other options   his goofy friend   played by artie lange   making a career out of playing the goofy friend   places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story    at this point   100   000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride    these women arrive at jimmie s location and immediately start bullying him about what he s looking for in a woman    when he s had enough of their unjustified attacks   he tells the angry mob that there s been a mistake and he won t be marrying any of them    as a result   the women proceed to chase him around the city   in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off    this goes on for the rest of the film    it s just chris o donnell running from 100   000 obnoxious   greedy   angry and stupid women    my groans of disgust could be heard for miles    the film finally ended   thankfully     but to this day i m still groaning    the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video    it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1   85   1   cast and crew info   and special dvd rom features    the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc   which contains scenes not in the film    apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o donnell around the city   and at one point o donnell is leaping from the tops of buses    so that was bad enough to be cut   but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good    ugh    
Neg, there s a 1   000 foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact    i d say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies   which are getting more irwin allen  esque with every release    the early wave of this revival   while just as cheesy and laughable   at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes    deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama   with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking    the repeating cycle is as follows    the president   morgan freeman   will go on tv and tell the country that there s a remote chance a comet will strike the earth   but that the nation s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem    then we get to see the plan in action   in some sequence utterly lacking suspense    the mission will barely fail   and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth   and there s a remote chance it will strike   but that the nation s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem    it goes on and on throughout the movie   but every time freeman goes on tv   we know his plan is going to fail    how do we know this    because we ve seen the tv ads for deep impact   ads that feature freeman telling the nation that   the comet is still headed right for us   and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading    ladies and gentlemen   that is the movie    successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow   but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30 second tv spots    television is what s wrong with deep impact    the main character   played by tea leoni   is a low level broadcast journalist for msnbc   and that s the mere tip of the product placement iceberg   who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy    she thinks it s an instance of an ex secretary of something or other   james cromwell   resigning because of a mistress   and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area    when she goes nosing around cromwell   he begs her to keep it under wraps       i know you re just a reporter   but you used to be a human being      she figures out what s really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search   where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction  level comet    upon a top secret meeting with president freeman   leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference   at which she gets to ask the first question    and everyone knows   if you get to ask the first question   baby you re a star    leoni ends up in the anchor chair   broadcasting every step of the comet s collision course with earth    and i m sure it s comforting for her to know that   even though the world s ending in a matter of months   she s a cable news personality    so there she is   narrating the six astronaut mission to blow the comet up    such personalities as robert duvall   jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged out process    but as anyone who s seen the commercials knows   the astronauts fail    they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces   which means even more destruction to the earth    yeah   thanks   nasa    that s when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren t picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years    they even have animals   two by two   ready to climb into the cave    if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed   deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie    instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife   while people pack the highways out of town    the reasoning is   of course   that if a comet is going to strike   they might as well be out in some scenic rural location    and   amusingly   the highway is spotted with people in u haul trucks    i m sure it s comforting to know that   even though the world s ending in a matter of minutes   the u haul people are doing the most business of their lives    
Pos, what surprises me most about the long awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker    the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis !  i can hear batfans everywhere protesting     first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman   and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! !    and   indeed   this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play    nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding   oscar worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman    nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown   romero played the joker in the  60s tv series      on one hand   nicholson s joker is extremely funny    his murderous escapades and manic outbursts   which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts   bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film    but on the other hand   his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind    the joker s cruelty and demented   diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister    this guy is off his rocker   and he not only knows it   he flaunts it !  but enough about nicholson as the joker   i m sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman    like many   i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader    but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting !  keaton delivers    he is convincing as the tormented millionaire   bruce wayne   and beneath his hard   black body armor   he is mysterious and formidable as the batman    even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character   keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city    visually   batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team    the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak   gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as   the dark knight returns   and   the killing joke      burton s film is a feast for the eyes   the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen    the sets   costumes   and make up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations    nicholson isn t joking when he boasts     wait  till they get a load of me !    his grimacing smile   green hair   and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous    keaton s wardrobe is equally appropriate    batman s cape   mask   and body armor make him look threatening   frightening   and invincible bringing to mind not adam west s campy costume in the tv series but peter weir s outfit in robocop    production designer anton furst s sets are a wonder    gotham city is dark and foreboding   almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york    the batcave is cold   bare   and desolate    the world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption    the movie s gritty bladerunner/robocop look is a joy to behold    the plot   on the other hand   is not as rousing    the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting    it takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear    batman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology   but it fails to give us enough of either one    as i mentioned earlier   the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker   but it never fully establishes batman s psychological motives and underpinnings    in terms of action   batman is not as thrilling as you might expect    burton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story    more than anything   batman is a mood film    while batman may not completely absorb and excite you   it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books    thanks to its distinctive look   the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world    
Neg, adam sandler isn t known for appearing in deep   thought provoking films   but he s still a really funny guy    most of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them   but because they let sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out    big daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandler s comic performance   and it s a miserable failure    sandler plays a thirty something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy   played by cole and dylan sprouse      as one might expect from the synopsis   director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences   including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say   good bye   to one another   in addition   there s a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor   urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself      there s a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters   and the film features passable performances from sandler   joey lauren adams   as the love interest     and the two young boys   but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny    
Neg, all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos   please raise your hands    thank you for identifying yourselves   now would you all please go away    your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade   and it shows no sign of abating any time soon    it isn t just the strobe light quality of your twenty cuts per minute editing   or the numbing over use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised   featuring the music of         no   it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected   banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles    welcome to the club   scott kalvert    your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one dimensional   serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole    dicaprio stars as jim carroll   the new york poet/songwriter/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based    as the film opens   jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey   mark wahlberg     pedro   james madio   and neutron   patrick mcgaw      one night   jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine   and shortly thereafter to heroin    jim s addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral   as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach   bruno kirby     kicked out of his home by his mother   lorraine bracco     and drops out of school    along with mickey and pedro   jim becomes a victim of the street   living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower    the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years   but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner    screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll s posse   resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic   but now with equally unsympathetic friends    as a film   the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale   a 100 minute long   just say no   public service announcement   but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie    jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie   but i suppose that his pseudo sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out    perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those   good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd   that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be   i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd    without a character who changes in any appreciable way   the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung out cohorts   all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack    director scott kalvert doesn t have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work   so he substitutes silly slow motion photography   self consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing    on only one occasion   when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in   are any of the gimmicks effective    mostly   they just draw attention to how hollow the story is    they also don t allow leonardo dicaprio s performance to be as strong as it could have been    for every impressive moment   like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money   there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics    dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors   particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex junkie who tries to help jim straighten out   but kalvert won t let character interaction define this story    he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star   shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting    at isolate moments   the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio s talents    far more frequently   it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like    
Neg, as you should know   this summer has been less than memorable    with a total of 4 decent films   it s not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing    with that said   you can pretty much predict what my opinion on   the 13th warrior   will be    the film is based on the michael crichton   eaters of the dead     in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king    after tarveling for many months   he comes across a gang of norsemen   who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog    so   they start picking men   and are left without 1   thus ahmed is choosen    so far it sounds interesting right    not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes    after that   they basically run around killing    that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film   because once your story is introduced   you have the rest of the film to start developing it    obviously that s not the case here    even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure   you will be disappointed    since all the action takes place in fog   it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances   and to poor camera work    can t the camera men sit still    i d like to actually watch a film in focus   but again   they failed to deliver that as well    the film moves on and on until the point   where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you re eating    with corny dialogue   that the characters laugh at for some odd reason   a script that goes nowhere   dull action sequences   a predictable ending   and worst of all weak characters   there s basically nothing to like here   except for maybe the set designs    that s the only thing that honestly caught my interest    when i heard that john mctiernan   the director   wanted his name kept out of the project   that made me wonder why    well now i know    crichton s greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product   which led to a big arguement    what s there to argue about anyway    the film couldn t be saved   no matter how much they spent or casted    seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money   i wouldn t be surprised to see   the 13th warrior   become a hit    please do me a favor and save your money at all costs   or else you will be lost in the fog   like the film itself    
Pos, carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town   she goes to college in california    there she meets the residential advisor pauly shore   who is a city boy    when gugino goes back home for thanksgiving   she brings shore with her   and her parents   lane smith and cindy pickett   are less than thrilled    dan gauthier   gugino s boyfriend from high school   proposes to gugino    gugino isn t ready for anything like this so she makes up the story that she is engaged to shore    she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end    forget jurassic park   cliffhanger   the firm and last action hero   son in law is the film to see this summer    son in law is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers   especially fans of the wiez    when son in law is long gone and forgotten   the blockbuster summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see them then    this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it    nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen    although the basic story line has been done many   many times before   the film is still fun to watch    the laughs are plentiful   especially when the wiez is around    the way some of the jokes are done are new   even though some of the jokes are old    there are also several new jokes that   at least   i haven t seen before    still   when presented right   even old material can be funny still    this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesn t contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price    the cast for this film does an excellent job    pauly shore   encino man   is the star attraction of this film    he is great   and knows how to entertain the audience    pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are hilarious    this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role    carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl    she makes her character believable   on some levels   yet interesting at the same time    the person who played the grandfather   mason adams   i believe   also does a great job    the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on the screen    patrick renna   who played gugino s little brother   was a little annoying   but no where as near as macaulay culkin   and for only part of the time   so i can forgive him    tiffani amber thiessen   a killer among friends     saved by the bell     does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen    she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on television    she wasn t given overly much to do in the film   but what she had   she does a good job with    
Neg, come on hollywood   surprise me    stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue   sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset    the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls    personal   because his niece is one of the victims    it s a slobbering psychopath   of course   but this time there s a twist    freeman notes that each of the young women who ve disappeared are all strong willed   assertive   and more successful in their careers than the average girl    we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova   whose aim is to   dominate   these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem    anyway   one of the women manages to escape   ashly judd   and teams up with freeman to       well    you know the rest    a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs   with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants   may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story    perhaps   but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue    so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further   okay    and as for comparisons to seven       oh  please !  kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass    maybe the novel was a stinker to start with   but whatever the case   it s the writing that s clearly at fault here    one   these characters have very little to say that s engaging or interesting    two   the script has no sense of humour    three   while the notion of a psycho s victims being smart   successful women is an interesting twist   the execution isn t even half as good as the idea    thus   ashly judd comes across all out of focus   instead of being the heart of the story    we can t feel her rage    some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she s the no bullshit 90 s type   but these conversations barely register    and as for freeman   kiss the girls is his second dog in a year   first chain reaction   now this    for an actor of his calibre   this is most worrying    young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction esque things to do in denver when your dead    but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this    not much   and you can hardly blame him    there s a few well staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls   dives and jumps   and the effect is startling    but the script is beyond rescue    what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe   safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up    complacency rules   it s been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters   real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue    the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie   positive proof that the best things in life aren t free              
Pos, countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously   had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally    luckily   movie reviewers aren t burdened with such legislation    otherwise   small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer    in case of star wars   1977 science fiction epic by george lucas   the consequences would be even more severe   because that film is very special for tens of millions   if not hundreds of millions of fans    in any case   objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews   because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best   if not the best film of all times    those who don t usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery    the author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold   objective standards in reviewing this film    like so many previous reviewers   i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago   and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since    perhaps it was childlike fascination with   until then unimaginable   wonders that happened long time ago   in a galaxy far away    or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots   with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before    anyway   watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life    and it was also unmatched for many years to come   because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas  epic    star wars wasn t just important movie for me   or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment      it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema    until than   american motion picture industry was in a limbo   social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood   and new authors filled the void   mostly by using hollywood s financial and technical resources to create serious     personal   or   artsy   movies    as a result   audience   traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate   didn t want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen    george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue    the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm   and huge financial success of the movie   later backed by supplement industry of toys   books   comics   role playing games and other merchandise   slowly began to change the face of hollywood    serious   adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion   and were replaced by industrial products of   blockbuster   philosophy    one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre    until 1977   science fiction movies were mostly in b production domain    in late 1960s   bigger budgets for science fiction didn t look so strange anymore   thanks to the great success of 2001   a space odyssey    but the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism   and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production   mostly dark   dystopic movies    however   in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies   even among the audience that usually doesn t like it    as a result   seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away   although some good   dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s    after that   science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment    ironically   the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of   new hollywood   generation of young movie authors who made   artsy   and   personal   films in early 1970s    george lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138   and nostalgic drama american graffiti    both movies were considered   personal   in its time   despite latter one becoming very popular    in a sense   star wars is an also very   personal   film   and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it   not for it    but unlike many   personal   movies of the era   its   personality   was in line with the wishes of the general audience    the plot   set   a long time ago   in a galaxy far away     begins in a time of civil war    the evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic    in order to quash any opposition   the empire had built death star   superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets    the information about death star   acquired by rebel intelligence   is being transported by princess leia organa   carrie fisher   when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser    princess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader   played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones     but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots   c3po   anthony daniels   and r2d2   kenny baker      those two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker   mark hamill     young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot    his adventure begins when r2d2 escapes   because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi   alec guiness      old man is actually the last surviving jedi knight   member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force    after some hesitation   luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess   while the old man would teach him the ways of the force    their small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely   where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo   harrison ford   and his furry sidekick chewbacca   peter mayhew      critics who don t like the movie   especially those who can t forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of   new hollywood     are prone to point the lack of originality    on the surface   they might be right   lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood   westerns   wwii aviation movies   old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s   yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa s samurai classic the hidden fortress    on the other hand   those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further   into collective subconscious of western civilisation   hinted by some mild tolkien references      the others would find the author s element within the story   star wars could be seen as an anti  establishment film   young   long haired   easy going   nature loving heroes are fighting against old   uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes    even out of its historical or social context   star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art    george lucas  direction is very good   with the clever editing and a well paced segments between action and dramatic buildup    characters are well drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients   both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster    we have a   coming of age   hero   damsel in distress   somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time     reluctant helper   benevolent mentor   diabolical villain and   finally   comic relief in form of two non human characters    some of the actors are very good   alec guiness in his most famous role to date   james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease   peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form    unfortunately   the same can t be said for the main leads   among the main trio of mark hamill   carrie fisher and harrison ford   only the last one had the character three dimensional enough to launch his further acting career    the thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology    often comparisons with 2001   space odyssey   another ground breaking sf film   were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas  superiority over kubrick    however   the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive   even after two decades   although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly     yet they aren t the most remembered trademark of the movie    that honour should definitely go to the   oscar    winning soundtrack by john williams   whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career    newer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release    yet   even if they are immune to the george lucas  magic they should watch this film nevertheless   perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture    
Pos, getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity    the film was directed by randal kleiser   who brought us such bubble gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon    but thanks to kleiser s surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script   getting it right is a pleasantly quiet   moving   and memorable film  one geared strictly toward a sophisticated   adult audience    getting it right stars jesse birdsall   emily lloyd s boyfriend in wish you were here   as gavin   a painfully shy 31 year old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who  gasp  is still a virgin    gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon   but expose him to a single 30 year old beauty and he s a mess    much to gavin s surprise   the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan   lynn redgrave     a rich   married   and lonely 45 year old    getting it right is the simple story of gavin s awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right   that is   to find the right woman to fulfill his life    getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in depth character development    gavin s self conscious voice over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche    we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self confident maturity    birdsall s superb   understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film   he seems convincing and authentic throughout    the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin s life    despite her limited screen time   redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin s middle aged seducer    for a supporting character   joan is unusually and impressively complex   thanks in large part to redgrave s magnificent performance    gavin is also pursued   or perhaps plagued   by minnie   the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat    after minnie and gavin meet at a party   she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life    helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role   and sir john gielgud   with his tongue in his cheek   embodies the height of arrogance as her father    gavin s eventual love interest is jenny   the adorable twenty year old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon   london stage actress jane horrocks  fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character    peter cook   the great british satirist   appears briefly in the film as gavin s uptight employer    the scenes of gavin s home life with his parents are also a treat    gavin s over protective mother   pat heywood     whom even woody allen would find overbearing   almost steals the movie    her life seems limited to just two activities   treating gavin like a 10 year old and preparing exotic but inedible meals   such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce    gavin and his father s attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing    getting it right   for the most part   is very well crafted   except for two minor shortcomings    first   the movie is about 15 minutes too long   and consequently it loses momentum at times    second   the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin s best friend   harry   and his unfaithful lover   winthrop    overall   however   getting it right is quite memorable for its humor   depth   sophistication   and outstanding acting    director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard   adapting her own highly acclaimed novel   deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth   maturation   and self discovery    
Pos, have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally   at any given moment   in life    or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world   or outside of it    these thought provoking questions are the subject of   final destination     which is the most riveting horror drama since 1999 s   the sixth sense      stylishly filmed and tautly directed by   x files   alum james wong   the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters   in accurately written   teen speak     rather than overwrought   highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn t use     all the while developing into a darkly foreboding   severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less successful   but still suspenseful epilogue    at the start of the film   17 year old high school senior alex browning   devon sawa   is about to leave with his 40 student french class for a field trip to paris    progressively getting a case of preflight jitters   he spots several mysterious   coincidences     including the departure time being 9   25   the same as his september 25 birthday   as well as hearing the john denver song   rocky mountain high   over the sound system in the airport bathroom       john denver died in a plane crash     alex grudgingly mutters to himself    once seated   alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff   and after causing a ruckus onboard   he   as well as six other students and a teacher   are thrown off    arguing in the airport lobby   alex s suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight   killing all 300+ passengers   including the rest of their classmates    as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode   the fellow survivors   whom he has saved   treat him in varying manners    carter   kerr smith     the hotshot jock   holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate    alex s best friend   tod   chad e   donella     wants to stand by him but can t because of his fearful parents    the teacher   mrs   lewton   kristen cloke     is frightened by him   believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster   as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker    only outsider clear rivers   ali larter     who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex s premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before   is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life    that is only the setup of   final destination     and the less said about what follows   the better    suffice to say   the film does   indeed   turn into a slasher film   albeit one that is more thoughtful than most   and replaces a knife wielding maniac for the never seen granddaddy killer of them all   the grim reaper itself    the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes   and   final destination   surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years    graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner   they manage to occasionally be so intense you don t know whether to shrink down in your seat   tap your feet in nervousness   or turn away    devon sawa   a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999 s underseen slasher comedy     idle hands     is even more of a charismatic presence here    the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival   which he comes to believe he wasn t meant to do   as well as the loss of the other passengers   is superbly and subtly acted on his part    one scene   in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful    ali larter   1999 s   varsity blues       in the other central role   is also effective   as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before   leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man  the exact opposite of her now deceased father    the other roles are not as fully written   and most remain rather one dimensional    the movie is mainly sawa s   however   and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles    tony todd   1992 s   candyman       as an arcane morgue attendant   pops up for a five minute cameo   but his appearance is rather supererogatory    and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye   while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy    ultimately   what is so good about   final destination   is that   within the confines of the slasher genre   writer director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner   and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten  two things that are rarely found in today s horror films    if anything   it s safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again    
Neg, i am a steven seagal fan    i only say this now because   mufti splenetik   isn t my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things    any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on    seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue   heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones   which we ll always hear when seagal does his limb twisting thing     rarely a female co lead in sight   unless it s a real life model wife who hasn t worked since weird science   and   usually the worst possible titles you can imagine    not to mention very straightforward plots   generally all round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather face himself in that same black outfit he s been in since nico doing his   my hands are sharp   nimble knives   thing   seagal the stoic   sir petrified ponytail   duke of dull    in the glimmer man   seagal breaks out of this formula   he gets a * sidekick *   attempts to banter   and puts on a new vest    he s also put on quite a lot of weight    small potatoes   you may say   a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to   but damnit   if it ain t broke   why fix it       more on this disappointed person s dashed expectations later      as jack cole   seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past    while he and his partner   played by keenen ivory wayans   are investigating a series of ritual killings   cole himself becomes a suspect   especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole    it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin   you just can t trust these homicide detectives     someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them   and hence   well   you know   that   glimmer man   thing    an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger   more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman   bob gunton     cole s former cia boss   brian cox   and deals involving chemical weapons    the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff   drawing   as with his other films   elements from the hotter films of the year   eg   se7en      it s the other changes that disappoint    for example   although there s a fair amount of violence in this movie   there s also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans   probably the best known of the wayans tribe   how many are there   exactly     from television s   in living colour      wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal s bead adorned and brocade draped cole   keeping up his   are you crazy   part of the dialogue with wasted zest    as campbell   wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner s eccentric habits   but the chemistry between the two is minimal   and seagal s wooden comebacks make for painful watching    a cook in under seige 2   seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble    he chants   refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies    again   a benign   if trite   plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual    heck   he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film    is that a lot to ask of the seague    too much    seagal s best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies   to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages   and to do it silently   and alone    not for seagal   the snappy one liners of arnold and stallone   nor the attempts to show that he can act   much less think    no kindergarten cop   no oscar   just simple   unadulterated deathblows    that s really how it must have started   like minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing   knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else    we trusted him    we got to know him    now   betrayal    i don t know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he s going to try to be funny again    i ll try   but it won t be easy    if you haven t watched the glimmer man yet   you might want to wait for the video to come out    it s easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences    after all   if we can t depend on our fantasies   what can we depend on    the flying inkpot rating system   * wait for the tv2 broadcast     * * a little creaky   but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good   bring a friend     * * * * amazing   potent stuff     * * * * * perfection    see it twice    mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan    everybody makes mistakes once in awhile    
Neg, i never understood what the clich     hell on earth   truly meant until very recently    i ve just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying   so horrible   so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as   hell on earth      after all   i ve never been to war   i ve never been the victim of any violent crime   i ve never really been broken hearted   and i ve never been audited   so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was   hell on earth    then i saw cruel intentions    in a perfect world   i would be in charge of all the movie studios    the very first thing i d do in this perfect world   would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20 something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv   and throw them in jail    but it wouldn t just be your average jail   not even a maximum security installation    i d have these producers   and everyone else involved in the production of these films   put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity    now you re probably thinking to yourself     is this really how bad cruel intentions is      the answer is no    it s actually much worse    watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumble s awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound    and then pouring acid on the salt    i don t know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum   tara reid   whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet   but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom    from that opening scene   where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz   to the conclusion which i don t remember because i had practically fallen asleep   cruel intentions is truly   hell on earth     right up there with war and tax audits    
Pos, it was easy to fear the worst    begin with a classic 1960 s television series   add a big budget and an a list star in the lead role   and stir    script   you ask    who needs one   kid        we ve got ourselves a formula    that was my fear   a bloated monster without any sense of direction    then   much to my amazement   everything that could possibly go wrong        didn t    the fugitive is as lean   taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years    under the direction of andrew davis   1992 s under siege     the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go    expect box office to go through the roof   deservedly   and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones    the premise is a simple one    dr   richard kimble   harrison ford   is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer   a man with an artificial arm    after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry   kimble finds himself on the run    his one goal   to find the one armed man   andreas katsulas   before u   s   marshall sam gerard   tommy lee jones   finds him    where the fugitive surprises the most is the script   by jeb stuart and david twohy    in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic   the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence   its attention to detail and its respect for the audience    in an early sequence   kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard   slick back his hair and change into a lab coat    on his way out   a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn t know is kimble to zip up his pants    it s a small moment   but it punches home the urgency of kimble s situation   and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget    later   while trying to lose himself in a parade   kimble thinks to drop his overcoat   the most likely way he d be recognized from behind    it s these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble s tells gerard that he s too smart to be caught   he may just be right    credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators    the bus crash which allows kimble s escape is a spectacular sequence   as is a leap from a dam into the water below    the action is crisp and brutal   and never romanticized    special kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single mindedness of the two leads    and what a pair of performances those leads are    tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard   because he manages an incredibly challenging feat    for the first third of the film   there is really no * villain * per se   kimble is on the run   and gerard is out to find him    it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent   vindictive inspector javert   but that never happens    instead jones plays him as a sharp   committed man who s just doing his job   so that when he responds to kimble s comment     i didn t kill my wife     with a matter of fact     i don t care     we know exactly what he means    it s not his job to determine guilt or innocence    it s his job to bring in a fugitive    this is a well  written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form    the only unfortunate thing about jones  stunning turn is that it s likely to overshadow harrison ford   and that s a shame    for his entire career   ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero    however   he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble   always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence    the fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing   and ford is up to the task    this summer has been loaded with action/suspense films   and most of them have been doing brisk business    however   it s time for clint   sean   and various dinosaurs to step aside    the chase is on    my advice is to catch it    
Pos, let s face it   since waterworld floated by   the summer movie season has grown * very * stale    with no new eye candy for four weeks straight   we ve had to sustain ourselves on the quasi nutritional value of cheatin  husbands   traveling chocolate salesmen   and computer  generated serial killers    sigh    thank god for desperado    the freewheeling sequel to el mariachi  director robert rodriguez s notorious $7000 debut  stars a cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist with no name    he s a man in black with revenge on his mind   and an arsenal in his case       the woman he loved was killed in the first film      so   he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers   sort of a tex mex version of the punisher   if you will    there isn t much of an emotional core to desperado    rodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo       and sergio leone        and sam peckinpah          some may wince at the body count  at least 100 graphic killings is a fair estimate  but it s all played for laughs    big   broad   hispanic laughs that   for me   recall the physical comedy of blake edwards and his pink panther films    sick   slick fun    
Pos, on april 12th   1912   the most astonishing shipwreck in the history of the world occurred    on that fateful night   the titanic sunk    now   more than 50 years later   a film has been made    and what a film that is    james cameron s newest movie is a landmark in storytelling   emotion   and special effects    it starts in the present   where bill paxton and his band of scientists explore the depths of the ship s wreckage    exploring an old chest   paxton comes across a nude drawing of a young woman    the drawing is televised and the woman   gloria stuart   whose portrait the painting is of comes forward and slowly but surely   the ship s story is told    leonardo dicaprio stars as jack dawson   a young man with a sketch book   a heart of gold   an intelligent mind   and not much else   he wins his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game   and is the perfect match for rose dewitt bukater   kate winslett      she grows to love jack   but seems unable to escape the slimy clutches of her arranged fiance    cal hockley   billy zane      the film takes its time   and by doing so   makes us care about its characters   and shows us the full aspects of human emotion    the leads shine   there is no bad performance   in fact   these do not seems like performances at all   but genuine people   trapped on the doomed vessel   facing certain death    watching this film   i was amazed at how vivid and real these situations feel   the time rose and jack spend together at a third class party   the naivety that jack feels when he skecthes rose nude   the terror felt by all onboard   as certain doom turns people into both cowards and heroes    this   the most expensive movie ever made   $200 million   is destined to make its profit back   and then some    it also has more emotion and warmth than any other film this year     even this decade    it is also yet another first   the first $200 million dollar romance   and every critic in this country will agree that it was indeed   money extremely     very       well  spent    
Neg, robin williams   this time without a beard   returns to drama in this sloppy   sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects    he plays chris nielsen   who meets annie   annabella sciora   and promptly marries her    they have two great kids   who sadly die in a car crash    just when it couldn t get any worse   chris gets killed in a car crash   and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert   gooding jnr      annie can t take the grief anymore   and kills herself       all sounding like good fun so far      the  penalty  for suicide is to go to hell   and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller   max von sydow      based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson   what dreams may come is clunky   manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar    this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made    everything is wrong about this movie   the performances are forced   and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters    williams puts on a convincing upset face   but that s all it is   a face    there s no emotion behind it    sciora s performance is lazy   and bogs down the whole film    she may look pretty   but she can t act    max von sydow is o   k as the traveller   if nothing special    cuba gooding jnr   thankfully   adds some bounce to his performance   and is certainly the best performer in the film    it s a shame that his character is so flat and 2 d   and offers no room for improvement    all the performers have to work with a soppy script   that tries it s best to get some emotion going   but never takes off the ground    there are  some  scenes which could be real heartwarmers   but the faceless characters don t help to get anything out of the performers    while films like e   t used great actors   music and direction to pull of a masterful heart tugging scene   what dreams may come is haphazard   expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically    instead   it s all rather boring    sure   the music is pretty   by michael kamen   and the cinematography isn t bad   by eduardo serra   but there s something lacking    the script doesn t help   filled with hopeless romantic clich   s   and dud speeches    richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories   sadly this novel would look embarrassed in a bargain bin   let alone being converted into a $70 million vehicle for robin williams    despite being set in heaven   what dreams may come is mightily depressing    the film rushes a happy ending   but everything before this is very   very sad and black   which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid    but there s one redeeming feature about this failure of a movie   the special effects    heaven and hell are truly incredible places   and the actors fit perfectly with the virtual sets    but despite this   what dreams may come   proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment of 1998    instead of raising questions about existence   it raises boredom    sadly   i recommend you give this film a miss    better luck next time   robin    a david wilcock review   1998     you know   for kids     norville barnes  
Neg, while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation   we had yet another shoddy   subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks    and   once again   we have one of the worst films of the year    the trend of the moment   and bear in mind it s a trend not a movie   is spawn   and if you ve seen the animated series on hbo you ll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man   an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment   he s been sent to hell    todd mcfarlane   the creator of the spawn comic book   must have had a tough time sitting through spawn   for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects   style over substance   ambience over anything else    not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects   the story   about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid   incapable manner   it becomes indigestible after a while    every character in this film is lifeless   vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student    the story begins   like in every superhero movie in this age   with a man living an idyllic life    al simmons   michael jai white     a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife   wanda   theresa russell   and daughter   has a tongue in cheek   wiseass partner   terry   d   b sweeney   and is content with the job his boss   jason wynn   martin sheen     provides him    the next element in the film is the part when things go awry    and as expected   everyone turns the tables on poor al    as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant   al is befriended by jason   and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene    inevitably   it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away    hence   jason s mischievous master mind plan   to ` conquer the world   is just commencing its initial stages   when al makes a pact with satan himself   agreeing to command the devil s army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again    so   our pal al has been uplifted to hell   and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place   his ol  partner terry forms a relationship with his wife    time passes    and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city   the ghetto where cog   nicol williamson   teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts   his motorbike   armor   etc        this character is merely a poor man s obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla    now the stage is set spawn   the new `enemy of evil  vs evil    and evil takes the cake   doubtlessly    john leguizamo s deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film s relief point    all this anguish   pain   half baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo   who steals the show and derives joy from his character   which is basically a compilation of so so one liners    and then there s martin sheen    whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years    his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent    as the megalomaniac boss   his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b movie   scrambled   and left in the shelf to rot    this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street    i d never thought i d be saying this   but at this juncture   charlie sheen s career is in better shape    spawn is a movie in which realism   or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable    for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling   jumping through roofs   and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better    it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie   a very bad superhero movie    continually the film kept on depending on special effects   and sadly   this is how pictures are being made    perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry    the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible    the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting    it is perceptible that director mark dippe   attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton s batman did touch   the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act    but bruce wayne had human elements to him    he was pensive   resourceful and had relationships   which made our perspective on him equally human    the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change   as if he s fatigued about being normal    and as all superheroes   batman   superman   the phantom   they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary    none of this is present in spawn    the fighting sequences are weakly executed   the dialogue is penny dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner s    as an example of this film s vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten   and then rescued by spawn   so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic    admittedly   i did laugh once in the film   and that s when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum    it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature    besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system   i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn    movies that present no admiration   no captivation   no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to    and kids will continue to see films like spawn   simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative   wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one    children are not muppets    and spawn unapologetically targets children    
Pos, written by mark rosenthal and lawrence konner  starring charlize theron   bill paxton   david paymer  as reviewed by james brundage  i m beginning to get fed up    over my four years as a critic   the thing which has kept me going is the moderate balance of films    the good balances the bad    i try to see both in equal proportions    but disney s mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which i haven t seen a truly terrible movie    it s a backwards machismo   i suppose   the urge to see the things which you so loathe   but i need to see a bad film every once in a while    and   you know what   mighty joe young doesn t qualify    far from being bad   mighty joe young is actually a family fun movie    it s enjoyable   appropriate   cute   cuddly   and all of those other things that i ve been seeing in every movie since a bug s life    mighty joe young tracks a 2   000 pound gorilla in the wilds of africa that is taken to a reserve in        california            for safe keeping    okay    a little unrealistic   but who ever said a kid s movie had to have the slightest hint of realism    the first half of the movie is a gorillas in the mist esque hatred of poachers woman of the wild motif    the second half is a straight up parody of king kong   awestruck onlookers and all    mark one down    i m feeling relaxed    it is   as a point of fact   an extremely un creative movie    but   as a vetern   i can say quite honestly that creativity doesn t count for as much as it should    so that saves mighty joe from my wrath   although my colleagues and cohorts and surely bashing this film at this very moment    this is not the film to take a girl on a date to    it s not the film for you    it s the film for you and your family    when you re right alongside your kid   all of the normal rights and wrongs slip away    the same thing happens when you watch a horror movie or an action flick    it becomes fun    all you have to do to enjoy mighty joe young is shut up and watch    
Pos, `we run tings    tings don t run we       sound advice from capone   paul campbell   to his squaddie   or partner     floyd   winston bell      jamaican film   shot entirely on video   featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo styled brotherhood morals   and a little gunplay      capone   a tough as nails super cop   gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home   while he was with his lady   and killed his partner in front of him    when he arrives   he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse   thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie   jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw     so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook      capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and   much to his disappointment   also finds out his childhood friend ratty   mark danvers   has been helping him    torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend   capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again    directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne   assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct     one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while    shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films   although the action isn t as hyperkinetic as most of woo s films are    the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though   and eventually begin to take on a life of their own   beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after      the make up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well   with flawless squib work on display from the effects team    the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue   spoken with thick jamaican accents   half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang     just adds to the interest    paul campbell   as the `loose cannon  capone   essays his role perfectly   displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times    mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty   the part time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together    unfortunately   carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective   largely because his underlings seem to run all over him     but then again   that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed    the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs   and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists   sly and robbie   who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones   maxi priest   bob dylan   james brown   grace jones   herbie hancock   bootsy collins   and carly simon among others      the end credit song   `we run tings    by the group red dragon   is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review    oddly enough   desmond ballentine   who plays the character deportee   is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta  reggae as the performer ninjaman   and he doesn t contribute a single song to the film   that i could see     which is virtually unheard of here in the us    at the time of this writing   third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us   coming off of a six month box office breaking run in jamaica   where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time   bringing in $21 million in jamaica   which is roughly $500   000 us      palm pictures   the company that released the offbeat   but entertaining six string samurai   is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market   i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters    chris blackwell   founder of palm pictures   was also involved in the production of another jamaican box office smash in 1981 entitled countryman   so i d say he has a pretty good track record    overall   third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo   ringo lam   tsui hark   and many other action films by directors from hong kong    if action films are your thing and you don t mind intermittent subtitles   then you can t go wrong with this film    the performances and the story are solid   if only a little cliched   and the action is tight    i m not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like   but apparently third world cop s honors are well deserved    
Pos, all those who were offended by there s something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie   a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch    and while this uproariously funny   gross out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste   it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end    american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage targeted fare this season    i must question the studio that releases a movie like this    the producers are aiming these films at the 15 24 crowd   but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r rated film    some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc 17   a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie    american pie was threatened with an nc 17   but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product   it was given an r   but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park    it is sick   perverse   and ultimately disgusting   not to mention extremely funny    american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night    jim   jason biggs     kevin   thomas ian nicholas     oz   chris klein   and finch   eddie kaye thomas   are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead    jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base   to which one of his friends replies   `like warm apple pie            of course   this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers   in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner    there are many moments   such as this   in which director paul weitz uses a game plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary   to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief    american pie is a hard fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it    i loved the young cast in this movie    consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with   obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects   and you should appreciate their performances    biggs is more than enjoyable   and chris klein   who recently played a similar jock in election   is obviously a young talent on the rise    but in a teen dominated movie   the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy   of television s sctv     who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim s uneasy father    scenes in which the familiar father son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie    after levy discovers jim s new use for apple pie   he tells him   `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age    but i never used baked goods      it is performances such as his   and bill murray s in rushmore   that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out    there are some less than original aspects of the film    a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex lax is something we ve seen before    if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers   then this is a decidedly unwise move   the same prank was pulled in the brother s dumb and dumber   and used to greater effect    secondly   the characters are forced into a half hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing    but at one point   in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it s own   biggs asks his buddies why he s going through so much pressure for something that s `not very important anyway      and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate   it still manages to be mature    in it s own way    
Neg, apparently   when crap calls   jim carrey answers    here he is   mugging it up in countless unfunny ways for the fifth time   his second go around in the role of pet detective ace ventura    that means more talking ass cracks   penis jokes and cries of   al l l l l l l l l l lrighty then      it all adds up to a sequel that makes the original resemble schindler s list in terms of dramatic merit   or lack of    granted   there are a few laughs amid the constant barrage of pre school humor   but anyone who appreciates good comedy will bang their head against the wall ten times for every minor chuckle    it s a painful experience for anyone with a brain    ace is distraught after accidentally dropping a racoon into a canyon   in a parody of the opening scene of sylvester stallone s cliffhanger   jim carrey being the only person who can make stallone look like a college professor in terms of intellect   or lack of   and decides to retire to the mountains of tibet to gain a higher level of consciousness   or   in his case   a level of consciousness      but he is pulled out of retirement to the tune of $20   000 to retrieve a sacred white bat for an african tribe    why africa    so carrey can disguise himself nude inside a fake rhino and later climb out the rear end as a tourist family watches     look   the rhino s about to give birth !        if that seems like hee haw humor to you   by all means   see the movie    if not   claim your place in human civilization with the rest of us    obviously   there are quite a few nonmembers of civilization who made this movie   like the first ace ventura film   i use the word   film   only because it was filmed   not because there s any level of artistic merit       a huge success    in fact   carrey only has a career because of the decline of intelligence in our culture    you may say to me     but andrew   look at jerry lewis    he was born with a negative i   q    and look how popular he was thirty years ago      maybe   but i still say jerry lewis is a notch or two up on the comedic ladder because he never actually did an impression in a movie of a rabid bulldog biting off a man s testicles        lewis at least had the dignity to save that performance for when company came over    
Pos, by phil curtolo mel gibson   braveheart   gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard s ransom    gibson plays tom mullen   a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath   played by gary sinise   forrest gump     and his band of low life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million    tom and his wife   kate   played by rene russo   tin cup   were instructed not to inform the police   but they contacted the fbi    minutes later   an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo   broken arrow   are in tom s house and wiring every phone    the plot sounds average   just like most other kidnap movies that you ve already seen   and it was nothing more than that    that is until about half way through the movie    suddenly   tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying     this is your ransom    but this is as close as you will ever get to it    instead   i am offering this money as a reward on your head   dead or alive      at this point   the plot thickened   and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense filled action film with great stunts    the last half of the film is very well done    another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise   as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie    owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject     it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones      before this movie   sinise played mostly   good guys     first in of mice & men   then in forrest gump   and most recently   in apollo 13    but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop gone bad    gibson   of course   was just being gibson   in an oscar worthy performance    although most of the scenes were quite predictable   ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film        
Neg, capsule   in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace    there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise    john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films   especially assault on precinct 13   that the new film comes off as his homage to himself       0    4 to +4      john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes    for a writer and director of horror films   supposedly an expert on horror   it is a very bad mistake to make    ghosts of mars is called a horror movie   but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low powered alien menace    in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars   carpenter would have grounds to sue    this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13   the thing   and prince of darkness    it is   in fact   surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way    but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience    ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176    mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear   which is good for the film s budget      it is never mentioned   but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth normal   again making it easier to film    society has changed a bit by that time   but it has advanced surprisingly little    apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control    and from carpenter s view   women have really made a mess of things    society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten    the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9   yes   precinct 9   has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony    instead of having the criminal   napolean   wilson   this film has the criminal   desolation   williams    instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face   well   ghosts of mars    because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner   but they essentially behave as human savages   in another lapse of imagination    the story is told in flashback   flashback within flashback   and flashback within flashback within flashback    ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red   yellow   and black    carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene   showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat    sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup    the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss    his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring    these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience    somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights    within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars   red planet   and ghosts of mars    after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by    i rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the  4 to +4 scale    following the movie i showed my wife   who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did   carpenter s classic assault on precinct 13    her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice    
Pos, i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set   unless i m watching a movie    i don t even have cable   so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching   the x files   every sunday night    it s the only show that s worth an hour of my time each week   though   since i don t watch reruns   i m glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether      i am an avid fan of the show   and have been for about three years now    and i love gillian anderson    the x files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off    the film is like a two hour episode   except that there are a lot more special effects   the plot is thicker   and the resolution is more satisfying    this is a terrific film   both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it   i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment      i expected to like it more than any episode i ve seen   and my expectations were met    actually   the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices   but   thankfully   the makers managed to do it right    when the finale ended   the fbi branch known as the x files had been destroyed   and our heroes   mulder   david duchovny   and scully   gillian anderson   were left stripped of five years of hard work    the film picks up soon after   and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building    but wait   i m getting ahead of myself    the film actually opens in the ice age   about 32   000 years prior   during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien    the alien s blood infects them   fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer     and the story jumps into modern times   during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer    it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy   and mulder and scully uncover the cover up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi    soon   they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens    as i ve written before   it s not easy to write plot summaries for films like this   because everything needs to be a surprise    fans of the show will know what to expect   and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film    director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen   making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television    there are some truly suspenseful and well created scenes here   late in the film   when they re in the alien spacecraft   you ll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema      the special effects are very good   and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic    what i find interesting is that the x files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story    our heroes are given subtle introductions   we re not expected to know them on the outset     and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn t required to understand the film    there are   of course   little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans   but i ll keep those as surprises    it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides   and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly    the series is strong for a lot of reasons    it s original   though it has many ties to   the twilight zone   and owes some homage to hitchcock     and impressively eerie for a television show    what really makes the series shine   however   are the actors    duchovny has so much presence   and is just a fun guy to watch    he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man    anderson is equally good   and paralyzingly beautiful   she s also a strong actress    both performers have acted in little more than their series   however   though i think they ll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon    i enthusiastically recommend the x files   both for fans and non fans    1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters   and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry    it s an intelligent film   and takes you places that you might not have been   or   at least   might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar      the x files is impressive in concept   as well   fans of the series are likely to be highly critical   and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move    it s nice to see a risk pay off for a change    actually   it s nice to see a risk at all    
Pos, in some regards   making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it    try too hard   and it snaps   but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther    in simon birch   director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique   he takes advantage of caution and poise   but also risks his movie with a few bold steps    in the end   he s not only holding an unbroken band   but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature    there s no doubt about it   the film that johnson has crafted is rich    he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown   maine   leaves turn bright orange in the fall   the grass is a lush green   pure white snow falls in the winter   and the sky goes on forever    the characters continue that turn   our two leads are simon birch   ian michael smith   and joe wenteworth   joseph mazzello      simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital   and by age twelve he s only two feet tall    joe is the bastard son of rebecca   ashley judd     and by age twelve he s ready to know who is father is    naturally   the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together   from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball    in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith   simon birch is convinced that he s god s instrument   and there must be a reason he s so small    joe doesn t quite buy it   but he sticks by simon   the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other s only true friends    early on   the two meet up with ben goodrich   oliver platt     rebecca s new boyfriend   and although the bond isn t immediate   ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other    both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability    the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon   a testament to the acting jobs of both    finally   jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day   and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show    mark steven johnson s sense of drama and writing is fantastic    the script is loosely based on john irving s novel   a prayer for owen meany   but it s so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from  based on  to  suggested by      along those same lines   it s almost unfitting to compare the two   johnson uses tension   humor   atmosphere   and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions    by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity   gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks   but the winning idea remains the same    simon birch is a different look at a different life   and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come    in the present   however   it s an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at

Neg, it s probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre     the matrix       existenz     would collide with the even more popular serial killer genre     kiss the girls       se7en        the result should have been more interesting than   the cell      as the movie opens   therapist catharine deane   jennifer lopez   treats a catatonic boy   colton james   by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that s never fully explained    after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert   catharine has no success to report    meanwhile   killer carl stargher   vincent d onofrio   has claimed another victim    his particular hobby is to kidnap young women   keep them in a glass cell overnight   and drown them    he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach   then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning    although carl s been doing this for awhile   he s recently become sloppy   and fbi agent peter novak   vince vaughn   is closing in fast    not fast enough   though   to keep carl from sticking another woman   tara subkoff   in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma    from the videos in carl s house   peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction    to save the kidnapped girl   peter has to find the cell before the end of the day   and comatose carl s not talking    so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl s mind and find out where the cell is in time    the focus of   the cell   in on the ornate interior of carl s mind   but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality    for the most part   it s style without substance    in his own mind   carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes   ming the merciless   as well as a frightened boy   jake thomas   abused by his father    all in all   the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place   and i kept wishing i could fast forward to the next development    singh is best known for directing music videos   particularly rem s   losing my religion     and   the cell   seems very much like a really long   really slow mtv video with the sound deleted    singer lopez seems to think she s in a video as well   she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting    the premise had great promise    the computer generated world within carl s mind could have been a bizarre   surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic    the first room catharine enters in carl s head shows this promise    she finds a horse standing in center of the room   suddenly   sheets of sharp edged glass fall into the horse   dividing it into segments    the panes of glass separate   pulling apart the pieces of the still living horse    this scene is twisted   disturbing   and thought provoking   because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder    another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath    their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie   and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine s own psyche    like sidney lumet s   the offence   or michael mann s   manhunter       the cell   could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator    however   catharine s character is hardly developed at all   and lopez has no depth to offer the role    bottom line   don t get trapped in this one

Pos, review  peter jackson s the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie   and still coming in at the extremely cheap $30 million price tag    but for those who were dismayed by this year s blockbusters like twister and independence day   the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects    and for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily    the frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high profile movie can get    michael j   fox stars as frank bannister   a con artist who can speak to ghosts    he uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people   then he comes and pretends to get rid of them    this is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago    frank s latest customers are a young couple   played by trini alvarado and peter dobson    when dobson ends up dead   alvarado starts to take an interest in fox    but dobson s spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he s dead    this leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado   with dobson tagging along as a ghost    things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town    fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims   but noone else can see that    so when fox shows up to try and save each victim   naturally people suspect he is the killer    fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector s hit list   and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox s attempts to save her from this evil spirit    there are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh    the movie starts off as a black comedy   and ends up a horror action film    the mix between these genres are perfect    no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror   and vice versa    one point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman    but that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form    michael j   fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife s death   and then is forced to confront this later on    alvarado   looking like andie macdowell   makes a great frightened   tough   and smart heroine    and jeffery combs   as a paranoid fbi agent   is brilliantly bizaare    the frighteners never once feels like it is running long    the first hour is as funny as any comedy this year   and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters    this movie is probably what casper would ve looked like if david lynch directed it    it s easily the best film of the year   so far

Neg, shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen    it is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies    that is   however   not to say it is a good film   a quality production or anything of the sort    shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work    the finest sign of this may be the plot   in looking back   there seems to be little more than a thin   predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books    philip henslowe   geoffrey rush   owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london    it is at the peak of the royal theatre era   and queen elizabeth   the recently damed judi dench   by   appropriately enough   queen elizabeth ii   is very much a fan    however   to directly quote the film   he has   cash flow problems      through a long set of events   it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts    so   mr   henslowe employs the young playwright   william shakespeare   joseph fiennes   to pen a comedic production    however   the young writer has a severe case of writer s block   and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well    he has the title in mind   romeo and ethel   the pirate s daughter   even that joke loses steam after a while   but can t seem to put words to paper    then   as only hollywood could have it   through a long set of twisted events   he meets viola de lesseps   gwyneth paltrow   and falls madly in love   thus curing his writer s block    there are many other little issues that mr   henslowe encounters   but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing    the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it s author    ironically   that couldn t be truer here    the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot   but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors    one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner   but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love    so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production   and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character s name in the credits    the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth s theatres    joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though    he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad    gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well    however   the supporting cast does almost save the day    geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking    they both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links    you will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting   no   armageddon doesn t qualify as real acting        and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well    but not even they could save this sad excuse for a film   so it remains plagued by poor performances    when all is said and done   shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained    however   as the film so kindly pointed out   entertainment may be fun   but it isn t necessarily quality    and this certainly isn t quality    perhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel   as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work    simply put   it is far fetched   poorly crafted   but very entertaining

Pos, this is a film about secrets   some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl   frances boyd   ashley      others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship   like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple   geoffrey gaines   stephen ramsey     the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field   and his artist wife   lillian   miriam healy louie     who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work    and   still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense   of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line    receiving a summer grant to study   chemo electric therapy     geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together   as their three year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her    he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab   which is off limits to her   as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice   convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses    his main argument is   that this is what the public wants   they don t want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments   they just want the benefits of science    that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster   much like frankenstein was created   is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science   science as a business   as opposed to the good science   science that cares about the small farmer     which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman   alex vine   david     a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field   trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming    he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially   as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming   methods that have just come about in the last thirty  years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins    the third view in all this is the artist s   represented by lillian   who points out that the artist s work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly     why shouldn t the same be true of the scientist      she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public   questioning what is good or evil in society   something that bad science has completely ignored    geoffrey   impatient to get ahead with his research   feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on   as he contacts one of the company s higher ups to argue his case   but decides he can t wait any longer for their help   so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester   the gorgeous pet dog of frances   a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life    while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car   he is spotted by alex and one of his co workers   and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife   afraid that alex will spot what he is doing   as he rushes away from the area    in the dinner scene that was   unfortunately   flatly done   but was nevertheless the heart of the film   as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat   a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything    the scientists engage in a rational argument   highlighting their different points of view   while lillian reacts in an emotional way   siding mostly with david s view but coming at it from a much different angle    it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies    that the director s point of view is absolutely right   is beside the point    the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one dimensional characters    geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster   alex vine was likened to his last name   the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability   while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art   the inspiration for goodness and beauty    alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian   as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other   but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them   lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex s apartment    geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy   and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working   as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him    the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely    the dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it   and mercifully the dog dies    the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage   but she also fails to respond to david s loving gesture for her to stay with him   instead opting to head back to the city    the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist s lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way    what is progress    what can one expect out of life    is the small farmer about to become extinct    the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art   which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way    that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions   leaving no room for deeper arguments   is the shame of this decent and smart film   that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white    no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in   it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic    there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me   as i don t like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically    that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit   that inspite of its shortcomings   it was worth seeing because of its visual statements   though they were also not too subtle   they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently   of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them   and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference    the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high    perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film   was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene    it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso s guernica had for him    both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world   and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on   will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on    the pain that lillian feels   as she forgets about her desires to raise a family   and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song     make the world go away   blares out from the background   after she has learned that frances  beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband   all in the name of science   had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science    perhaps   the most pertinent question the film asks   requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business   as the question becomes   can science be happily married with art    
Pos,    a bug s life   may not be   toy story     but it s more close than   antz   was    i really liked   antz     basically because   yes   it is clever and witty and intelligent   and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead   perhaps the year s most inspired casting     but there was   in fact   something missing from it   and i m the first to admit that    maybe it s that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun   it s too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging   and if it weren t for woody allen   it would have been just a really clever good not great flick       a bug s life   has a similar premise   and it also has disney to insure that it s g rated and not totally over kids  heads like   antz   was   not a bad thing   believe me     but what it also has is a tone that s completely innocent even when it s also remaining perpetually clever       antz   is still the more witty film   and i love it for it   and   a bug s life   is more for general consumption   but it s also more entertaining    it broadens its horizons   and when it really moves from the ant colony   it really shows us a whole new world we ve never seen before   and it s take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in   antz      it s also light and clever    the visuals are   instead of earth tones   bright worldly colors   and still gives the amazing visual technology of   antz   at least a worthy contender    the characters are also nicely realized   though watered down for broad consumption   they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films    the lead character   flik   voiced by dave foley     is nothing more than a slightly less neurotic z from   antz     but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z   instead of gene hackman playing the villain   we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper   the nicely titled hopper    and for the romantic lead   we don t get spacey sharon stone   but intelligent and hard to get julia louis dreyfuss   who doesn t even come around until the very final frames    not that the plot s really any better than the one in   antz     it s basically yet another redux of   the seven samurai     with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else    when flik   a bone fide inventor   creates a time conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season s donation   he puts them all in risk   and is sent away so that he won t screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers    he runs into a group of   warrirors   who are   unbeknownst to him   a group of carnival bugs   and they agree to help under similar false pretenses    these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in   toy story     foppish walking stick slim   david hyde pierce     german caterpillar heimlich   joe ranft     quick tempered and insecure male ladybug francis   denis leary     pretentious praying mantis manny   jonathan harris     his assistant butterfly hypsy   madeliene kahn     spider rosie   bonnie hunt     and two fleas   tuck and roll   michael mcshane     who speak in undiscernable jibberish    the writers lightly touch on each bug s place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can   and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats    grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake    a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat   whose usual mild mannered squeal is a scream of death    the bug city is a modern day metropolis   complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb   holding out a cup   with a sign lying next to him that says   kid tore off wings      and a rainstorm is like a giant flood   with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour    around this   the pixar animators stage several large set pieces   like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year   and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end   a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket    meanwhile   each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting   something   antz   couldn t do   and by the end   over the end credits     a bug s life   pulls it s final punch   out clever ing   antz   with a series of incessantly hilarious faux bloopers that come just at the right time   when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left   and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money s worth of entertainment    still   it s no   toy story      that film   maybe above any animated film i ve ever seen   encompassed almost true perfection in story   character   and wit    it proved that it didn t need to brag about it s cutting edge technology to really soar   it s the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far   but is still the most satisfying     and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun    yet   a bug s life     as well as   antz     are still amazing films   and prove without doubt   that if you re gonna make a computer animated film   send it to the guys who created these three flicks   evne if they re not working under the same roof    
Neg,    it was not scary      these are the first words that came to mind after it was over    when a movie is called  vampires      not scary   aren t words that should be associated with it    but that wasn t my only gripe    john carpenter is a name associated with cutting edge cinema   as in the intense scares of  halloween     the thing  and  the prince of darkness    or the offbeat action of  they live  and  escape from new york     unfortunately   the only thing that is cutting edge about  vampires  is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach    with an anemic plot and not quite kosher special effects    john carpenter s vampires  has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan    the film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers   led by james woods   of all people    like some sort of holy a team   they even have their own souped up van     the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack    their method is amusingly innovative   the blood suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks    to commemorate their victory   the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away    their celebration is short lived   however   as a master vampire named valek ambushes and single handedly destroys most of the team    woods  jack crow and buddy montoya   daniel baldwin   escape with their lives   along with a woman named katrina   sheryl lee      although the woman has been bitten   montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire    the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys  hunt for valek   thomas ian griffith     a freaky marilyn manson type who s on a mission that dates back 600 years    along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau   tim guinee     a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl    upham in  saving private ryan     some stuff happens in the middle of the movie   but i can t remember most of it   because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen     vampires  finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix   as crow   guiteau   and montoya assault an abandoned prison turned vampire nest    only then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick    but it s too little too late    we get the inevitable final confrontation   but it seems tacked on and rather anti climactic   come on   we re dealing with  the  master vampire here !    interestingly   last summer s vampire actioner  blade  was derived from a comic book   and  vampires  from a novel   yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former   a more deliberate superhero flick    woods  jack crow spouts glib off the cuff one liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh so cool stride    and his motive for killing vampires    take a wild guess       hint   a        killed his       when he was just a            at least  blade  had decent action and slick stylishness     vampires  lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer thin plot    to make up for this   the movie resorts to other   shocks     such as its generally condescending attitude towards women   crow slaps them around for the fun of it   and an overplayed contempt for religion   crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to   getting woodies        it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie    if not scary and gory   i wanted tense   relentless   and exhausting     john carpenter s vampires  is none of these    i can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan    for the rest of you looking for a good scare   beware    vampires  is a film with no teeth

Pos, alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters    i saw it when i was 13 years old   and i must admit that i didn t like it    of course   i was expecting aliens again   and i believe this was my fault    in order to appreciate alien 3   you need to see aliens   but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor    james cameron s aliens was an action film   and many people consider it the best in the series    i am among that group   but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film   which critics have bashed for its originality    many thought the final chase scene went on for too long   and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action    both are untrue   because the film has quite a bit of action   and the dialogue was essential and well written    as for the chase sequence   it was long   but not overly long   creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion    perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped    on the big screen   i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn t see    it was a very dark film   and the language was extremely harsh    i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities    don t get me wrong  i m not saying films should eliminate swearing   but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks   it gets rather distracting    however   since seeing it again   i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters    as a result   alien 3 s only flaw   albeit a major one   is the underdeveloped characters    we never really care about any of them   and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie    there were only two characters i liked   and of course one was lt   ripley   sigourney weaver     although we have gotten to know her through two other films    the other character was dr   clemens   charles dance     but because we like him   the inevitable occurs    alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off    the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher   who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry    without using a single line of dialogue   unless you count computer warnings     fincher sets up the entire film    an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card    we see lt   ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments           title          a shot of an alien egg           title          alien legs stretch up into the air           title          and so on and so on    during these first ten minutes   i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed    it s quite a remarkable opening   and one which will remain in my mind for a long time    because of this face hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens   the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod   and sent down to the nearest planet   fiorina fury 161   an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison    however   the face hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo tubes   and is sent down with the escape pod    unfortunately   during the landing   all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed    ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery    of course   you need a carrier for this face hugger   and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates    ripley is revived and asks to see the ship    after seeing a mysterious acid eaten section   ripley asks to see the dead bodies   and then have them cremated    this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films    featuring a monologue from dillon   charles s   dutton     a prisoner who has found god   the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog s demise    it s one of the most memorable moments   as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog    and this is where alien 3 succeeds    fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films   and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock   in fact   he is the mixture of both      fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it   and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films    alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images    by doing so   fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise    many people have criticized fincher s filming of the death scene of ripley   i reveal nothing by saying this   as looking too fake   but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal    showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch   but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron   a great deal of symbolism is derived    i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron    however   most people seem to want to witness ripley die   which creates a paradox   as she is the character i didn t want to see die      why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film   and i don t plan on spoiling that in this review    >from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever    in alien   it was   of course   the moment the alien burst out of kane s stomach    in aliens   it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine    alien 3 has several   but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley    ripley is pushed up against a wall   and the alien stands inches away from her    why it doesn t kill her is a shocker   which later leads to a surprise ending    fincher apparently loves to use close ups of actors  faces   michael douglas and the clown face off in the game in the same style     and by shaving off the actors  hair   the only thing we have to look at is their faces    many critics didn t like all the actors being bald   but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot    most of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story   but when you try to compare it to its predecessors   fincher s turn seems a bit gloomy and dark   though that s not always a bad thing    the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films   with some major twists    again   we are setup with several different characters   and one by one   they are picked off    however   while the first two had tons of arsenal   especially cameron s film     alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run down prison    as a result   no weapons are to be found    this creates a lot of tension   although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense    as an alien film   alien 3 is the worst of the series   but by itself   it is an extremely well made motion picture   with a lot more merits than not    the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one dimensional characters    i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about    despite this   ripley was the central figure   and that s what is important    we care for her   even though she began to act just like one of the guys    again   the technical side of this film is remarkable   and better than the two previous versions    while cameron s version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary   fincher uses brilliant camera angles   terrific lighting   and moody sets    the cinematography   by alex thomson   is very well done   with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie    the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in   as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around    the yellows   reds   and oranges of the lights create a dark mood   and by themselves create a lot of suspense    shadows dance on the walls   and yet those shadows could easily be the alien    the alien is different from its predecessors this time around   and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense    the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien   racing after the characters    the sets are quite incredible   which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien    the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed    the sets appear to be in the future   but not too far in the future    one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien   nothing surprising there      sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance   equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens    she was snubbed at the oscars for this one   mainly because the film was a critical bomb    her reactions are far more realistic in this film   with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter    it s quite touching really    charles s   dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates   and i was on the brink of actually caring for him    charles dance turns in a nice low key performance   and as a result   i cared for him immediately    lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii   but he was more entertaining in aliens    the rest of the cast is pretty stale   though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world    alien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language   and sex    although it has its flaws   alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism    this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie    while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films   fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out    it s a film like fincher s which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity   the final scene      in fact   it tells us that we   as a society   have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little   fake      whenever something looks

Neg, birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives    are we doing what we want to be doing    what happened to our dreams    with the new millennium   our collective big birthday   just around the corner   some people are sensing a certain dissatisfaction with their existence    the old standbys of traditional religion and science aren t doing it for many anymore and they re looking for something else    we ll be seeing more and more films with a metaphysical theme over the next few years    ricky hayman   jeff goldblum   is having a career crisis    the programming director for the good buy home shopping network   he s going to be fired unless sales increase dramatically    new producer kate newell   kelly preston   is supposed to whip things into shape    when the two are fixing a flat   they almost run down new age pilgrim   g     murphy      g wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they don t really want all that commercial crap    in some unexplained manner   this causes sales to sour    ricky is saved    the movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all    it s not an over the top comedy or a heart warming message of humanity    it  is  a mish mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog    i am willing to put up with preaching from a film   but the messages here are old hat    you should take time to smell the roses    selling your soul for cash is a bad idea    golly    i m glad i saw the movie    i never would have thought of these    the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed    when g takes a chainsaw to the set   there s an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious    it doesn t happen    the bits are so subdued and overly long that there s only a hint of laughter from the audience    murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better    there are hints of promise in this one    the only time the film picks up even a little is when his shaved headed character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen    the others are horrendous    goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career   but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his   invasion of the body snatchers      his relationship with kate makes no sense    they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen    preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be    somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value    an attempt to satirize stupid television   we get a self parody instead    
Neg, capsule   this super light situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems    the script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not a lot different from what is shown free on television    the characters are paper thin and the interesting ideas purely non existent    this is a decrement life by 90 minutes card       0    4 to +4    jalla ! jalla !  is basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen    it tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love    the film is set in sweden where roro and mans   fares fares and torkel petersson   are custodians at a public park   roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely   mans is a swede from a much more liberal background    they spend most of the day in the bushes at their park   cleaning up after dogs    roro and mans each have girlfriends   but each has a problem    roro   nicknamed   jalla     is having family problems    it seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman   yasmin   laleh pourkarim     but he is already in love with lisa   tuva novotny      yasmin likes roro   but does not want to get married either    mans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence    the two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other    mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers    the one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them    roro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other   but then plan to break up before the wedding    not too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected    the plot turns in several places are contrived    one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen    lebanese born josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer    when things start to get slow   he just adds throws in another story    for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film    characterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function    we do see some of roro s family life and his concerns    that may be because roro s background is a lot like that of the director    while the story was entertaining   i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile from the film    it was just a way to pass about an hour and a half in my life    one does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this    i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the  4 to +4 scale    
Neg, i cried during  babe     i admit it    the special effects   the story   the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a   children s film     so much so that   yes   i got a little overly sentimental    such   my friend   is the power of cinema    when word came out that they were using this newly developed f/x for a doctor dolittle update   in which eddie murphy plays the title character   and many great comic actors supply the voices   my anticipation rose to great expectations    they can t possibly drop the ball on this one    can t miss    can t possibly miss    they missed    what went wrong    after much thought   i supply three general rules       1   don t let a television actress turned comedy movie director near an urbanite script   i   e     penny marshall s dreadful   preacher s wife        betty thomas worked wonders with   the brady bunch movie     but the same sitcom airiness doesn t quite work here    it s as if she lifted a generic sitcom   and iced it with light doses of modern r&b    take away the black cast   take away the atrocious soundtrack   and you have the residue of some mid 80 s kirk cameron show       2   the greater the cast   the less the individual cast member has to do   i   e         con air        it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman   garry schandling   john leguizimo   ellen degeneres   and gilbert godfried in your lineup   but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped   stereotyped characters   one line at a time    it s even worse   because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don t get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits    now there are three character actors who do get special treatment   albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he s in   and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy    norm mcdonald fares nearly as well   as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle    but there s little humor here    that rests on the shoulders of chris rock   sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise ass guinea pig    even the mouth is ill synched       3   don t let the special effects technicians walk away with the script    there s a certain timing that s mandatory in comedy    to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson s creature shop   is a travesty    this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren t well timed laughfests   with the right director   they can be and have    here   betty thomas is clearly over her head    i wish i could commend the special effects   but they re merely average    count the number of times where the animal s mouth is turned away from the camera   or too far to notice   or ill synched    this is less a   babe   and more of a   look who s barking   clone    you may be wondering    how does eddie murphy fare      well   he came back with the exceptional   nutty professor     and i don t doubt he can come back again    here   he s tied into a straight man and given little to do    the exceptions are when he fears he s going crazy   a far cry from his smarter than you d expect routine that he s more adept at    it s unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago   making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years    after all this   what s left    butt jokes    a  lot  of butt jokes    i guess for kids that may be funny   but i was stone faced    if there s a lesson the film may be telling us   is that animals have feelings too   and they care way too much for your butt    
Pos, i don t know what movie the critics saw   but it wasn t this one    the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring    in my personal opinion   they couldn t be more wrong    if you were expecting airplane !  like  laughs and agatha christie intense mystery   then yes   this movie would be a disappointment    however   if you re just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time   this is one to see    honest   it is    this story is about a 4th network   wbn   taking to america s airwaves in 1939    penny henderson   mary stuart masterson     the station owner s secretary   must deal with her overbearing boss   an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment s notice   partly due to the fact that they haven t been paid in weeks    among the mayhem   she must also deal with her soon to be ex husband   roger   brian benben   who desperately wants her back    unfortunately   her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation    while trying to woo penny back   roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn    mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny   i m trying to be unbiased so i won t tell you how amazing she looked     although brian benben gets most of the screen time    along with the two leads   are several recognizable faces   including corbin bernsen   l   a    law     michael mckean   laverne & shirley   and bobcat goldthwait    the special effects are amazing   and fooled me   which some may argue isn t very difficult to do   in many scenes    although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy   it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie    overall   i gave it   or an   depending on what system you use    some comments collected from friends    
Pos, jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box sets on the video shelves    he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well off    maybe it s a classic case of displacement   it s easier to see jarvis  own lyrics   obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall   as a fetishization of lowlife   rather than leigh s films    but it s worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working class characters don t make for a guarantee of  authenticity    let alone a good film    it s the triumph of secrets & lies   then   that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek  authenticity  and honesty in everyday lives    following her adopted mother s funeral   hortense   a young black optometrist   sets out to find her birth mother   and is disturbed to find out that she is white    it is cynthia   a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne    cynthia s younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages   largely because of his wife s animosity towards her    hortense calls up cynthia   who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her    but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually    cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party   which maurice is hosting        secrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart    as one character puts it     best to tell the truth   isn t it    that way nobody gets hurt        but if the film delivers much more than a trite message   it s because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths   even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us    hence   cynthia s difficulty with acknowledging   first to herself   then to others   that hortense is her daughter    one of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever   been with a black man     before a long suppressed memory seizes her    at the party   cynthia s pretense that hortense is her factory co worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies   as agonizing as they are funny    little lies seep into every corner   like maurice pretending that he s   just dropping by   when he visits cynthia after much deliberation    maurice s job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme   a sad looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile   a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles    one of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face   she says she needs the photo to look   as bad as possible   to collect insurance money   yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars    there are occasionally hilarious moments   as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception     i ve got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs     or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne     if you ve got it   flaunt it   is what i say      as played by brenda blethyn   cynthia comes close to being a caricature   with her nervous   somewhat disconnected way of talking    but she s really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her   precisely because she s so needy of love   perhaps    indeed   the whole cast gives warmly rounded   detailed performances    the script was developed partly through improvisations   and the fusion of cast   script and director shows best in the party scene   seemingly everyone is talking at the same time   and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout    in a very different way   but also using a long single shot   the scene of hortense and cynthia s first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity   all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings    the film s climax   with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen esque revelations   and everybody hugging each other   is the one thing that seems false about this film    however   it s a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character s lives    when cynthia says near the end   this is the life   innit     you get the sense that   following the cynicism of his last film naked   leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all   without comforting illusions    the flying inkpot s rating system   * wait for the video     * * a little creaky   but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good   bring a friend     * * * * amazing   potent stuff     * * * * * perfection    see it twice    
Pos, now that   boogie nights   has made disco respectable again   well   fashionable at least     we shouldn t be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era    the latest art house interpretation is whit stillman s   the last days of disco      stillman   who made   metropolitan   and   barcelona   using some of the same actors   uses disco s final hours to highlight what is another conversation heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director    the young   upwardly mobile professional   don t call them yuppies !    men and women of   the last days of disco   frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire   amy grant   and andrea true connection    here they talk and talk and talk   intellectualizing about such things as dating   success   and being liked   accepted   and admired    if talk is cheap     the last days of disco   must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot    what makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie   harvard educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit   perception   and style   including   at one point   a riotously inventive deconstruction of   the lady and the tramp        na   ve alice   chlo   sevigny   and sophisticated charlotte   kate beckinsale   are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house    charlotte is confident and outspoken  perhaps a little too outspoken   alice is shy and introverted     like a kindergarten teacher      the two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot   looking good and looking for excitement   and that ms   beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor !      here they meet   or re meet   a variety of eligible men   many of whom they knew in college    des   played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman   is one of the club s managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back    des has reached a crisis point in his life   he just found out  last wednesday   in fact  that he s gay    whether it s true or not   it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend   jennifer beals in a small but soul baring turn      charlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth    jimmy   mackenzie astin   is the advertising exec who   by the end of the picture   winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain   visions of   barcelona          josh   matt keeslar   is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say   just once     book this clown !    and robert sean leonard plays another one of alice s revolving suitors   the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity    any film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book    in fact   the entire ensemble is appealing in that well spoken stillman way    while the eschewing of   ferocious pairing   is a favored topic of conversation in the film   the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love   lust   and trouble with each other in an emotional merry go round that cleverly develops its characters through the   preferred   dynamics of social group interaction    more mature than stillman s previous two films     the last days of disco   is as consistently droll as it is stimulating    it s a movie you should definitely get on down to    
Pos, of circumcision   psychic wounds and the family sitcom  the opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film    there s a guy s voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like   and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women    as his imagination plays o n   he   and we   picture these motley characters in a mix and match shuffle of unlikely marriages   businesswomen with bums   matrons with paint salesmen   the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy    it s not just a witty   funny summing up of the film  s themes   you might not guess it yet   but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on    what starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction   gets taken on a road trip   put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash    that may not sound so different from the average family sitcom   and the general idea of the film doesn t   at first   seem so wildly distant from standard issue hollywood comedy   man who was adopted as a child   ben still er   sets out on a journey to meet his real parents   along with his wife   patricia arquette     his baby   and a pretty psychology researcher   tea leoni   in tow    various mix ups   shenanigans   oddball characters and   yup   disasters follow    but if you think you ve been here before   the dialogue and the direction   by david o   russell   who made spanking the monkey   take it into another dimension    the dreaded t name seems an inevitable reference point   what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance   but really the point is that the foot massage master hasn t got a monopoly on plot twists and fast   funny   irreverent lines   or on the absurdities of ordinary speech    whether it s about circumcision   psychic wounds   oral sex   carjacking   the beauties of the armpit area   or ronald reagan   the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention    the best thing is how these words aren t just there for the punchlines   but are great precisely because they re said in character   like tea leoni s neurotically charged psychobabbler who s able to say under assault     it s understandable if you find this threatening      the cast is excellent throughout   and   rather than singling out anybody   kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting   with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission    there are some elements of a woody allen film in this   not to mention the hand held camera and loose   improvisational feel of some scenes      like allen   russell s interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children   and everybody   really      still   if you re expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la   murphy brown   /   frasier   / fill in the blank american comedy   well   it won t happen    the film sets up expectations like these   with the lead character s search f or his origins and his hopes of self healing   only to knock them down    if the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one ness   flirting with disaster s charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go    and that   the film suggests   is the essential family state   and you better learn to love it    somehow   this is perversely feelgood cinema   right up to its manic end    
Pos, one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting    the main story is about dr   james nookey   jim dale   who is disliked by his superiors   frederick carver   head of the hospital   kenneth williams     and dr   ernest stoppidge   charles hawtrey   who seems to dislike everyone    they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey    carver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore   joan sims   on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there    when nookey arrives at this island   he meets gladstone screwer   sid james   who has lived on the island just about all his life    screwer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients    dr   nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore s financial backing    however   nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug   and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug    the performances are all very commendable    sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role    kenneth williams   as usual   plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital    joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey    charles hawtrey plays an  out of character  role as dr   stoppidge   the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch    some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well   but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters    as a matter of fact   hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part    other regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again   but this part is probably her most boring  matron    and barbara windsor as nookey s love interest and unofficial  women s lib  campaigner   goldie locks    both jacques and windsor play their parts well    patsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick   and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell   from  steptoe and son  fame   and peter butterworth    the jokes are mostly very funny   the story is quite appealing   and the regulars seem interested in what they re doing    although it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies   it still comes out on top   it is the best medical carry on   because of the above factors    a must see carry on movie    
Pos, playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task   they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare s works    they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare   i mean   really   who doesn t think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate   introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter    stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare   and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare    and   despite the difficulty of their task   they have succeeded    shakespeare in love is one of the smartest   funniest   most touching films of the year    it s so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors   but here we have a movie that defines success   it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written    it could have been a smug   self important movie that panders to die hard shakespeare fans   but the appeal of this film is almost universal   if you ve ever read a play by shakespeare   or know anything about his life   it s likely that you ll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love    joseph fiennes   brother of ralph   stars as shakespeare himself   he s a delightful   irresistible lad   concerned mostly with women and detached from life s more serious problems   debt   plague   etc        he s commissioned to write plays for various people   queen elizabeth   judi dench   wants comedies   while local slimeball philip henslowe   geoffrey rush   needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann   tom wilkinson      shakespeare   however   has trouble focusing on his work    he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel    this all changes   however   when he meets viola de lesseps   a radiant gwyneth paltrow     a young heiress set to marry the financially oriented lord wessex   colin firth      shakespeare instantly falls in love with her   he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo    he discovers her identity and confronts her later   she   of course   falls in love with him   although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex    but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare s writing so much   and soon the production   which later becomes romeo and juliet   is set to be performed    shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film   not because it works as great entertainment   but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter    i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role   he has such searing optimism and energy   he s clearly a man who admires shakespeare   and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character   inability to turn away from women   attention deficit disorder     we sense a great deal of affection and care    he practically overflows with passion in every scene    fiennes is matched by paltrow   whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from     she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i ve seen her in    the two performers work perfectly together   taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic   and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh    of course   it doesn t hurt that they have a masterful script to work with    stoppard   whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film   is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor   all of his plays have similarly dry humor      the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet    one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play   in the movie   shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid    director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor    scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director    i m going to have to see the movie again   i m certain there are numerous references that i missed    in fact   i doubt it s possible to gather everything with just one viewing    stoppard is a master of detail   you ll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film   not as lines of a play   but as dialogue   suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time    there s also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe   and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself     proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe s mysterious death in a pub    there s also a scene featuring a wide eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing       there s no dog in this play         no !  no dog !    the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year    geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe   wilkinson is also hard to recognize   but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously    ben affleck   playing one of the actors in the company   shows great range   both in his accent   his is almost as good as paltrow s   and in humor   he has some of the best one liners in the movie      colin firth   always stuck playing the sap   does a good job being hateful    judi dench   however   has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth   rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words    my single   minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end    the story is moving   but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes    but my quibbling is not important    what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture   the sheer skill with which it has been written   acted   and produced    shakespeare in love tries so many things   and nails every one of them   it s a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him   a film in which the actors   writers   and director are all perfectly in sync    it s also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare s work in a positive way   without seeming condescending or superior    i admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly   but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them    not just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it

Pos, steve soderbergh s   sex   lies   and videotape     which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989   arguably began the resurgence of independent films    made on a shoestring budget of $1   2 million   with then relatively unknown actors   it is a provocative   thoroughly original drama    the film mostly focuses on the four central characters   all in their late 20 s early 30 s    ann   andie macdowell     an unfulfilled housewife   is married to john   peter gallagher     an insensitive lawyer   who   unbeknownst to her   is having an affair with her younger sister   cynthia   laura san giacomo      complicating matters even worse is graham   james spader   who won best actor at cannes     john s old college buddy   who comes to stay at their house    ann is absolutely won over by him   even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex    that is the set up for the last hour of the picture   and since the film is entitled     sex   lies   and videotape     it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise    director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker   ranging from the independent   to the mainstream   1998 s   out of sight       to the downright kafkaesque   1997 s   schizopolis        he is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances   and believes in the work that he does   and     sex   lies   and videotape     is probably his most confident   and maybe even best   to date    the performances are superb from all four leads   but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character    she is always a very winning actress   but this is probably her most three dimensional role that she has had   with a close second being altman s 1993 mosaic     short cuts        the other parts are perfectly cast as well   from spader s ominous graham   to gallagher s self involved john   to giacomo s outspoken cynthia    the final act of the film   especially   comes right out of left field   and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching   and it would be criminal to give away the film s secrets    suffice to say that   through one powerful sequence   ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell   and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty   as well as deception    the film has one fault   however    the characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another   and often unlikable    if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher   it probably would have helped   since his relationship with macdowell isn t quite as explored as i would have liked       sex   lies   and videotape     although minorly flawed   is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film    soderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it   and the final product certainly proves this    
Neg, teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood    every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular   and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights   wallets in hand    the formula is very simple   you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal    you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds   and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes   the typical teenage attention span    the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to   and   most importantly   they don92t care to judge films=92 quality   so any piece of trash will = due    that is just what never been kissed   the latest film from director raja gosnell   is   trash    josie geller   drew barrymore   is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times    she has her own personal assistant   unlimited supplies   and her own office    but she is very much dismayed with her position in life    there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field   where she can play a more active role in the chicago media    so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere   she jumps at it with elation    constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita   molly shannon   and her amicable superior   gus   john c   reilly      the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment   as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter    however   since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict   this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes   and josie is headed for the field    obviously   the field assignment involves a high school    specifically   she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school   by enrolling in the senior class and   becoming one of them      i don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring   so i won92t    the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school    interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was   and she appears to be heading down that road again    fortunately for this lame production   other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting    they include the predictable love stories   between both a student   jeremy jordan   and a teacher   michael vartan     to show that josie is really two people in one body    also   her younger brother and opposite   rob   david arquette   comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative    the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing    typical for teenage films   it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor    one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical    most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy    but those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie    following this trend of high school movie rules   comes the general acting    it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film    in this case   drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch    she is required to play her character on two levels   having some very black and white transitions    and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray   she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time    at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel   and is expected to him on an adult level   since he is one   her teacher    but she never seems to get out of the gray area   and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance    following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon   saturday night live      she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to   and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic    it is these   qualities   that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent    luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film    david arquette   scream   takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic   and not have his brilliant acting ruined    and as a central character he gets to take on his own mini plot   which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed    in a dazzling cherry on the sundae type piece of work   he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit   risky business    never been kissed is a mediocre film at best    the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood   that it is sickening to watch time and again   and this film is no exception    the acting is just as bad   but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light    unfortunately   the bottom line is that the movie will be a success   because teenagers will pay to see any trash    
Neg, the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffany s in which the audience is rooting for some sweet   vulnerable   irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness    the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo   played by sook yin lee   as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible    alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene    this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland    one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa    she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window    next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild   adam beach      he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating    ben gets emotionally involved with alessa       as alessa so delicately puts it     we were bosom buddies   now we re fuck buddies        but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor    the real problem with the film seems to be helen lee s inability to decide what she wants to be saying    she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa    alessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients    this appears to be a high profile and well paid job    we are supposed to care about alessa s feelings   but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father    alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint    this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double zero    i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a  1 on the  4 to +4 scale    
Pos, the small scale film   in limited release     waking ned devine   is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town    filled with breathtaking scenery    characters    and delightful music   the movie would be interesting even without a plot    the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review    the film starts out with a sharp opening   which gives us a taste of what is to follow   country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny    what gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town   pop 52   of tullymore    who that person is   and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie   ian bannen   and michael   david kelly      part detectives   part scalawags   they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds    the village consists of several amusing characters    a clueless pig farmer   temporary priest   and a witch    there s also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up and up    there are no hollywood touches to this film   except for the outer space introduction [ ! ]    pacing is right    towards the end   it runs a bit out of steam   but that s okay because for most of the 90 minutes we ve been interested in the goings on    a mixture of laughs and   occasional   sentiment   all the right emotions are engaged    in one brief dream sequence   you ll know it when you see it   a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists    one of the key moments in the film    the music   available on cd   london 289 460 939 2   follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering    a fine film that s for everybody except action fans    somewhat like  the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain            but livelier    
Neg, this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset   the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st    elsewhere for several years   and i had understood that the director/screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also    i am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations   nor were they satisfactory    if i had to list a reason why          but that would be getting ahead of myself   besides   it s not immediately clear   as there are so many problems with the film    adam arkin plays a grade school teacher who is sardonic   cynical   and somewhat abrasive   but a good teacher    he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court    one day   he meets a drifter   david morse   who plays jack morrison on st    elsewhere   in the park   and inveigles him in a game of one on one basketball    morse turns out to be good   and a friendship slowly develops between the two   as their respective professions progress on the screen  arkin s teaching   and morse s selling of paper flowers to passing motorists    so far   my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue   and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack    good music to be sure   but it doesn t replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story  it makes the film somewhat minimalistic   a technique i rarely admire    suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse s introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin s   a woman arkin has long admired from afar   but it too reticent to approach    it appears that she begins to admire morse   who enjoys here attentions   but isn t sure what to do about it  she doesn t realize that he is a drifter   and knows nothing about his past     and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else    until then   i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film    the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full fledged failure    the woman   at least to me   appeared to be fairly shallow   i didn t realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin   where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse    somehow   this is made to appear as if it is arkin s fault   and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he s gotten such a find of girlfriend    frankly   dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make   punching her in the mouth not the least    after this   the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural    if i had to summarize a major gripe   it s that this is a story spread too thin   that creates semi likable characters at the outset   and then suddenly jerks them into being 16 year olds at the last moment    it might be true to life with some people   but that doesn t mean * i * have to like it    i don t        avoid    
Pos, trekkies   roger nygard s energetic and hilarious documentary   brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions    the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non fans alike       the film generally writes off the trekkies vs   trekker polemic as not worth arguing about      the good spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable   loud giggles   yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe    denise crosby   who played tasha yar on   star trek   the next generation     serves as the host    in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary   oed         the oed cites a february   1976 caption in the   new yorker   as the first recorded usage of the word      unless you ve been to the conventions   i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans    one pointed out   apologetically   that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate    others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended   several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of    my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams    arguably the most famous of all the trekkies   she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die hard fans do    her claim to fame is that   as a juror on the whitewater trial   she wore it in court as well       every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan like stoicism     she says   describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession    she doesn t quite understand all of the uproar       i m an officer of the federation 24 hours a day     she reminds us    her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith    along with the laugher the show evokes   there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty    and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment    few other avocations could give this much satisfaction    these people are having the time of their lives       for the record   i m not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies      the film interviews the various star trek series s stars as well as its fans    the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade   but over twenty years later   the conventions are still going strong    filled with anecdotes   the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions    at one   the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel    after appearing briefly   he drank some water and left    they decided to auction off his half empty glass   joking that it had the   q virus      the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too    with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity    not just flitting among people   the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies    one guy is a trekkie cross dresser   another dresses her cat   and then there is the dentist    the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set    he   his oral hygienists   his receptionist   his wife   and his kids wear the outfits all of the time    it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home   but not his family    for variety   he and his family do change characters from time to time    he says his patients like it    well   there was this one complainer   but he had a problem with his bill anyway    there are summer schools for klingon with ph   d   linguists to teach the language    hamlet is now available in klingon   albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore   and they are working on translating the bible    they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs   even u   s   customs    the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series s larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns    sandwiched in between the levity   the switch in tone doesn t work    the incessantly up beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator    he fits right in    trekkies runs a breezy 1   26    it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages    
Neg, well   what are you going to expect    it s a movie about a big snake that eats people    that s what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film   because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more    instead   i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me   too    anaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river    led by anthropologists dr   steven cale   eric stolz   and terri flores   jennifer lopez     the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives    along the way   they find poacher paul sarone   jon voight     and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda    to simply say that this is the world s largest snake wouldn t be doing it justice   since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide    if this isn t a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers   i don t know what is    at the beginning of anaconda   we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past   but that seems to be more or less over now    i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line   but it ended up being a set up for nothing    cale chokes on a deadly wasp   don t ask me how that happens   i don t know   and is put out of action   relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help    this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot   since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone s plan to capture the snake    however   this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film   and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle    most bad characters are either annoying or stupid    in this movie   they re both    since this description applies to all the characters except sarone   it s hard to find someone to root for    you re supposed to back the good guys   but you really end up cheering for sarone because he s smarter than everyone else    or maybe he s just not as dumb as everyone else    at times   i almost found myself rooting for the snake    there are no standout performances here    everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters    even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason    no matter   as in most monster movies   the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway    in most of the scenes   the snake is computer generated   and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real    however   the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences    sometimes   for example   the snake just moves too fast    it catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall   for crying out loud    then there s another scene where the snake eats one of the characters   and we see the snake s skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim s pained expression from within the snake s belly    absolutely ridiculous    a testimony to the film s bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film   where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is    in a scene totally unrelated to anything else   we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther    the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard   one of the panther s eyeballs pops out    eeeewwwww    above and beyond the sick factor   however   this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed    in films like these   a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained    if the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see   we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them    to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don t know about   and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown    in a case like that   the showdown just ends up being a letdown    when i saw the snake for the first time   i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn t the real danger    this one was just a decoy   and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe    no such luck    okay   maybe anaconda is actually a decoy   and there s really a better movie waiting to make its debut    
Neg, with his successful books and movies   michael crichton is doing well    with early successes with westworld   1973   and coma   1978     and recent films such as jurassic park   1993     his films have been entertaining    however   he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere    this $100 million mess by good director barry levison   disclosure   is dull   long winded   and a huge disappointment    considering the huge budget   the all star cast   and a story by crichton   sphere is majorly disappointing    the film opens with norman goodman   hoffman     a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors    however   when he arrives   he his told by supervisor barnes   peter coyote   that he is actually investigating an spacecraft    along with goodman is mathematician harry adams   jackson     biologist beth halperin   stone   and ted fielding   liev schrieber      they investigate the spaceship   find a massive sphere inside   meet an alien intelligence called jerry   and basically weird crap happens    unfortunately   something went wrong along the way with sphere    the film starts off entertaining enough   but throughout this very long movie   it just gets sillier and sillier    the film jaunts along from scene to scene   never fully explaining what is going on    the actors and directing don t help   either    hoffman is on autopilot   and almost seems embarrassed   throughout the movie   churning out dull lines   and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie    stone is useless   displaying no emotion   and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman    the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson   who s funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere    but he s hardly in it   and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone    the same goes for peter coyote   who hams it up as the officer   but is then killed off halfway through    the director   barry levinson   who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure   1994   messes up with the drama and the action    the drama scenes are   quite frankly   boring   and the action scenes suffer from overkill   with levison throwing the camera all over the place   much like the godawful speed 2   1997    the writing doesn t help much   either    although crichton is great with plots   he s terrible with dialogue   and practically every line in sphere is a dud    the speech is too simple   i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent    practically every line is just stating the obvious    none of it is smart    also   where the hell did the budget go    the sphere itself is impressive   and there s a few nice special effect shots   but where the $100 million went is anyone s guess    there s a giant squid attack in the picture   but not once does the audience see the squid   even though the film has a massive budget    i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid   and if handled correctly it probably would    but the whole scene is done badly   and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid    finally   the film has no idea what genre to be    levison can t handle his own plot    it leaps from hokey sci fi   to horror   and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller    and   of course   the film is very much like the abyss   1988     although in it s defense   crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released   and is far superior to this rubbish      it s not all that bad though    the plot is all right   there s a few jump scenes   although nothing very scary   and there s the occasionally interesting bit    but overall   sphere is a big waste of some fine talent   a lot of money   and a potentially good movie    not really worth seeing    overall rating= review by david wilcock  
Pos, you may not have heard of lucas   or if you have   you might not think much of it    probably because it stars corey haim   or maybe because it s about a little geek who collects insects   or maybe because it doesn t feature slick one liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80 s    however   you have been missing out on a true masterpeice   the best film of 1986   and the best film about adolescent life ever made    corey haim stars as lucas bligh   a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair   thick glasses   and an interest in insects and other outdoor life    one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him    her name is maggie   a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty   with lovely red hair and a sweet   innocent complexion    maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her   but somehow he interests her   and soon they are talking and getting to know one another    they gradually become good friends   and spend the summer together doing various things   such as studying insects   namely locusts   who come out of hiding once every 17 years     playing tennis   and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover    lucas is obviously in love with maggie   and while she is charmed by him   it s clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend    this is not clear to lucas   however    he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate   and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what s about to happen    we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally    they throw him on stage   right in front of his beloved maggie    surprisingly   he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around   but he takes it too far   and is embarassed in front of the entire school    the next scene is brilliant    maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally    she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened    he rails back against her   in a cruel unfair fashion    in lesser movies this would ve turned into a confrontation between the two characters    but maggie is written smarter than that    she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him    next we are introduced to another great character named cappie   charlie sheen      he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend    what s interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks    of course anyone with a brain can tell what s gonna happen next    cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas  relationship    this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone    she s been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt    maggie is charmed by cappie s tender undertsanding demeanor   not to mention his shirtless body    this scene is so delicate and sweet   but cappie still has a girlfriend   preventing either one from acting on their desires    desperately trying to puncture the tension   cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room    it s not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend   in the films only subpar scene      lucas finally figures out what s going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance    this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself   such as try out for the football team    the last third of the film revolves around this attempt    while the idea seems cliched   the way it is executed is not    there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up    dave grusin s memorable score   played at the perfect moments   certainly helps    lucas is filled with great performances    forget everything you know about corey haim    back in 1986 he had talent   and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3 dimensional performance filled with anger   humor   and pain    kerri green is very appealing as maggie   showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her    sheen s cappie is almost too good to be true   but sheen makes him beleivable   especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas    there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti s ben   a friend of lucas   whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks    also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina   the girl who admires lucas from afar    when people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s   you hear john hughes this and john hughes that    lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so called classics    but hopefully   like with heathers and say anything   lucas can begin to find it s own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald    it deserves more than that   but i don t want to be greedy    
Pos, a costume drama set in the 1500s   england   elizabeth is a lush   romantic   political masterpiece about the upset over the crossing of a protestant queen from a respected catholic one    when the court and country are a whole after the passing of the queens   the royal family   so to speak   are upset that a protestant should be crowened   and not another catholic   plus   the new queen   elizabeth i   cate blanchette     was the bastard baby of the previous queen mary s father    the persecution over catholics and protestants isn t the only majority in elizabeth    elizabeth i must face the decision to give up personal pleasures   and her lover   joseph fiennes of shakespeare in love     in order to rule   successfully   the country   which she did for 40 more years    both elizabeth and shakespeare in love are set in the elizabethian era   and both feature a queen elizabeth i   judi dench plays her in love     or course    yet   i found elizabeth more stimulating and involving than love   not just because elizabeth features a great deal more of elizabeth i   but because i found blanchette a more powerful   hypnotic sense for the role    elizabeth   also featuring geoffrey rush and richard attenborough   is my pick for the best picture of 1998 award    it s a dynamic   important   breathtaking film of loyalty   power   greed   and trust    shakespeare would die for the book rights    
Neg, a pseudo intellectual film about the pseudo intellectual world of art magazines   high art is as wasted as its drug addled protagonists    in the only notable part of the movie   ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles   not that lisa cholodenko s script or direction makes you care much about either character    living in a world of heroin induced highs   they float along until they fall in love with each other    this uninviting picture   full of pretentious minor characters   has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius   having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant    24 year old syd   radha mitchell     who has a rather bland   live in boyfriend   was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine   frame      although the receptionist is impressed   syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner   ally sheedy      for her to do photos for   frame     lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her    lucy lives with her current lover   a washed up german actress named greta   played with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson    the two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope   usually heroin    this does not happen in a single episode   but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture    syd   who lives in the apartment below them   joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club    lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs   which apparently is funded by her mother    lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being   pigeonholed     and   since her mother has money   we can only assume that that s how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses    a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer s work is transcendental or merely classical    that no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny       your work has a cultural currency that is important now     is the artist speak that the frame s manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine    when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd   her idea of a romantic line is     i want to get high with you      in lucy s world   sex and drugs come hand in hand    and the movie   except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing   shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene    this vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions    in another movie   it might have worked   but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted    high art runs 1   36    it is rated r for explicit sex   pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age

Neg, after the recent animated debacles of     a rugrats movie     and   a bug s life     i am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks  other insect film from october     antz      i hated that movie   and yet   it is so much better than these latest two excursions       a bug s life     is the second animated insect film in the last two months   and i hoped for the best   considering it was done in the wonderful style of pixar s last film   1995 s   toy story     but in no way does     a bug s life     even remotely match up to that    flik   david foley     an ant   who along with his many comrades   has the job every year of gathering up the seasonal harvest   only to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers   led by hopper   kevin spacey      flik   however   feels all alone and unwanted in the world   especially after he accidentally loses all of their food   and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up a whole other season s load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees    banished from ant island   flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out   but through a misunderstanding   returns with a handful of helpless circus bugs   including a walking stick   david hyde pierce     a dung beetle   brad garrett     a gypsy moth   madeline kahn     a male ladybug   denis leary     and a caterpillar   joe ranft         a bug s life     has one thing going for it    only one thing    with its glorious   bright colors   the computer generated animation is a spectacle to look at    the film itself   unfortunately   is a lifeless   unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitement of     toy story      the characters in     a bug s life     are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality   other than to stand around and recite arbitrary and thoroughly unfunny one liners    the thin story was also stretched out to a nearly unbearable 94 minutes   and it often felt as if they ran out of ideas throughout   and so they made up pointless scenes to pass as time filler    after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year   i was beginning to think that i had simply outgrown them   but then i realized this is just not so    i still adore almost all of the older disney films   and many of the newer ones   such as 1989 s     the little mermaid     1991 s     beauty and the beast     1993 s     the nightmare before christmas     and yes   1995 s     toy story      maybe this has just been a bad year for children s films   and hopefully   the upcoming     the prince of egypt     will not be a disappointment    as for     a bug s life     i did not enjoy anything about it    not the story   not the characters   and not even the voiceover work   which was far more lively in     antz         a bug s life     goes down as yet another failure for disney   and it is a sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture     i ll be home for christmas      
Pos, anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia   wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes   deep   vibrant colors and an epic storyline    it s true beauty comes from it s subtle ruminations on the politics of power   whether it s between governments   or the interplay between a man and a woman    anna   jodie foster   is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband    with son in tow   she takes the employ of king mongkut   chow yun fat   to tutor his son in the english language    mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country s future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world    anna function is to help provide that link    the core of the film   of course   deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate    foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide eyed wonder    she is assertive   yet   respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him    it is one of foster s strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career    she brings a mature self  awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster    it s a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut s monarchy    when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid film   she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance    chow yun fat s king mongkut is every measure of foster s anna   perhaps even more so    this is the chow yun fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years    he is imposing   yet vulnerable   playful   but stern    it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance    precious time is stolen from the movie s 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king s concubines   bai ling   and her love of a commoner    it strikes with the subtlety of siam s fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story    some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie    although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film   it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma   a country backed by the british    anna and the king transcends being a predictable   traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness    it shows a seduction of intelligence    ever mindful of each other s positions   anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs   conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying   if not achingly bittersweet    
Neg, around the end of 1998   a japanese cartoon came to the usa television   and really wasn t that big    in fact not many people even knew what pokemon was   but in 1999 it hit big with kids and adults alike   and became one of the biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time    in fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon   the first movie which for what it was   wasn t all that bad    it grossed $31 million in its opening weekend   and went on to make almost $90 million    fans thought it was great and now is a second movie in the pokemon craze     pokemon   the movie 2000   which is far inferior to the original animated movie    first up is the plot   which there really isn t much of   in fact the plot what there is   a bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon   lugia   is about it   except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever    well there you go   of course ash is followed by his friends misty   brock   gary and his pokemon friends   pikachu   squirtle   charizard   the usual    even though the first movie wasn t a great film   it was definately an enjoyable well made movie with an actual thin storyline    this new movie however is nothing but garbage   there is nothing good to it storywise   and its only good thing comes from some plush animation and colors    compared to the first film   this movie is awfully bland   from its opening titles   to the end titles it tries its best to work   but fails miserably at every corner    the characters are 1 dimensional   the story thin as chicken broth   and the writing very lame    even the so called action scenes are extremely lame   and falls before it even gets a chance to go    the voices even aren t that good and almost feels like the stars don t want to be there   like they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie    which it certainly is    the film has one thing going for it and that is the animation   although not up to disney standards   it is still very good with some interesting cgi s and very colorful animation   the colors jump out at you very fast   and seem very nicely put on film    why a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation is still a question to be answered   hopefully pokemon 3 next year will be much better than this trash    for now watch the first one    its much much better    
Pos, big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america    o   j    simpson   tom capano   the menendez brothers    all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms    and   of course   courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood    whether it be john grisham s thrilling novels or television s famous dramas   the courtroom has always provided big bucks    so when i rented a civil action   i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker   a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat    however   what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected   a major surprise   but fortunately   a pleasant one    john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it    no one expected him to light up the screen in grease   nor in saturday night fever    but   whenever he gets knocked down   he always seems to come back fighting    a civil action is not john s best performance   but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998    travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations    his performance is not flashy   nor memorable   just solid    if he delivered the only solid performance   this film would still be average    luckily   he has a strong supporting cast    william h   macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood    he continues to deliver great performances one after the other   but he is still regarded as a secondary actor    in a civil action   he delivers yet another great performance as travolta s paranoid and greedy accountant    he is not a lovable character   but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film    he is not one of the big time lawyers   just a measly accountant    but   he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998   but there is actually someone better in a civil action    robert duvall is also an underrated actor    he gets many leading roles   but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks   brad pitt and jim carrey    duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co defendant    duvall is magical in this role    he is the wise teacher   who not only battles it out in the courtroom   but also manages to teach every major player a lesson   in his own twisted way    in many non comedic films   directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy   to keep the audience on their toes    unfortunately   they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny   jar jar binks   anyone        however   this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed    this is not the case in a civil action    they have comedy coming from all sides    whether it be duvall s inane questions or macy s sharp anger   the laughs come in a steady pace    granted   it s not roll in the aisle funny   but it provides a nice addition to the film    the plot is terrific  somewhat    the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom    then the case that will make or break jan   travolta    s career rears its ugly head    they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it    however   budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt    i will not spoil the rest   although i must speak of the one downside to the film    the courtroom debates are great   but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored    it left me somewhat confused   although the rest of the film is terrific    all in all   john travolta is back yet again in this great film    his supporting cast   consisting of macy and duvall   turn in tremendous performances   which ease the load on travolta    the film is smart   witty and thought provoking    not only does it gauge in court battles   but also the various tolls it can take on the major players    a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves

Pos, field of dreams almost defies description    although it s about baseball   it s not a baseball movie    although the film is extremely spiritual   it s not about religion    and although field of dreams is melodramatic   it s not a tearjerker    to really understand what field of dreams is all about   you have to see it    in the film   kevin costner plays ray kinsella   a baseball fan    60s berkeley graduate   and iowa farmer    one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields   ray hears a voice   it tells him     if you build it   he will come      then ray has a vision and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn   shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again    and even though it depletes his family s savings and his neighbors think he s crazy   ray clears away the corn and builds a baseball field   complete with bleachers and flood lights       if you build it   he will come      and lo and behold   shoeless joe does come  bringing with him several of his dead teammates    and then ray hears the voice again   it tells him to   ease his pain      ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann   an influential and radical novelist from the  60s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society    with great aplomb   james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on a magical and spiritual journey    the cast in field of dreams is excellent   especially kevin costner in the lead role    costner gives a quiet   subtle   and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life    costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale    amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray s feisty and loving wife   who against her better judgement supports her husband s crazy ideas    in her most impressive scene   madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p   t   a    meeting   displaying the sincere passion of a  60s berkeley radical    ray liotta is appropriately eerie and awe inspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe   the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the 1919 chicago   black sox   scandal    and finally   burt lancaster is memorable in a small   but important   role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning    field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life   wonder   mystery   spirit   and humor    it   for the most part   succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief    ray kinsella s spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous    but while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama   it unfortunately does at times go overboard   and by the end it gets down right sappy    in general   however   field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasy  one i can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics

Neg, late in down to you   the lead female character   julia stiles   states her greatest fear is having an   artificial conversation   with her boyfriend   freddie prinze jr        the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out   fallen asleep   or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy    the film is a multi million dollar testament to everything artificial    filled with characters   motivation   plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster    prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles  freshman co ed    at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out doing the previous in how   cute   it can be    the happy couple   psychoanalyze   each other   they pick out a song because   as prinze s dj mother   lucie arnez   explains   every couple needs a song   he smells her shampoo   she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love    then   in standard romantic comedy style   things fall apart    why    well   because they have to    otherwise the couple can t make up and live   presumably   happily ever after    down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic    scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism   but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead    a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre   not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together   or even knowing each other   but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat    the supporting characters are remarkably flat   and insultingly ridiculous as well    stiles  best friend   rosario dawson   is a pot head   prinze s roommate   shawn hatosy   is a girl crazy fool who can t meet women   and then there are the porn stars   zak orth and selma blair      he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television   does the college lecture circuit   and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film    you know   the average porn star    the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he s on screen   the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes    she is a porn star mostly so we know she s slutty   so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted    attempts at drama   which means julia is going to cry   include a pregnancy scare and the big break up    these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes    what happened here    the cast is full of likable   promising   young actors   stiles especially seems to be going places      writer/director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off    in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year s extremely unpleasant the story of us   for teen audiences    the direction is film school grad obvious    it s stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen   a pointless parody of   cops     characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters   and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion    plus   the whole story is told flashback style   narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera    this is the second film in a row   following wing commander   starring freddie prinze jr   which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she s all that    if he doesn t start making better choices fast his future films won t be so lucky    
Pos, notice   this is a review and analysis of exotica    the first part of this piece is the review   the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers    if you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so   then save the second part for the discussion afterwards    starring   bruce greenwood   mia kirshner   elias kosteas   don mckellar   arsinee khanijian   sarah polley director   atom egoyan screenplay   atom egoyan  exotica is a film that grows on retrospection    exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film    all of the people know each other   but apart from that   there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account    the director hints for possible solutions   using a multi line plot   so popular with critics in mystery train   and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction    exotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique    at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together   in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features    the out of chronological order technique has become ever so popular   perhaps even de rigueur   for biographical films    similarly   we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use   to varying extent   converging multiplots    on a first glance   once the multi plot puzzle in exotica is solved   there seems to be little left to look at    but perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather   commentaries on views of life    exotica is very much worth seeing    it opened to critic s praise worldwide   i first saw it in mexico city   last december      in canada   it broke records for a movie of its kind   which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release    apart from a strong plot   acting is very convincing   and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie    the spoon fed entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie   and thus it might last little on screen    but if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd   with an originality that is ever so rare   by all means see exotica    analysis   * * spoilers * * ahead    what is behind the complex plot in exotica    first   a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means    the lone tax auditor   the repressed homosexual pet shop owner   the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub   the rich man which has the club remodeled   the audience at the movie theatre   all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul          then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people   including those who sit watching exotica          in that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub   for the rich man looking through silver mirrors   and poor rich people looking at other s people lives through a silver screen    exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people   such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner    exotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner   which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person   no attraction to the strip dancer     and only interested on avoiding jail   no personal relationship with the tax auditor      in exotica everybody is watching   and what is worse   everybody knows    second   exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings   about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters    the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter   the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter    the niece becomes the baby sitter   the baby sitter becomes the dancer   and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter    the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj   by finding the proverbial daughter    a chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle   just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie    
Pos, that s the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into   the wedding singer     the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus    does he draw laughs from his sad   puppy dog expression and don t hate me for being a simpleton observations    or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people    or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over    well   there s a little bit of all of that in   the wedding singer   and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr   sandler s thing   i did have a surprisingly good time    that s because   in a nutshell     the wedding singer   is one of the sweetest movies you re ever likely to come across    that s right    sweet    the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh out loud hysterical but the tone    well   it s just lovely    i have to admit i was half expecting farting armpit humor   gratuitous nudity   superfluous   cloying subplots   and some nasty   unnecessary violence    instead    well   i ve said it before    sweet    the year is 1985 and sandler plays robbie hart   the eponymous wedding singer   a job aspiring rock stars often settle for    when robbie s fianc   e dumps him at his own altar   robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia   drew barrymore   who has some problems of her own   she s marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who   unbeknownst to her   isn t that big on monogamy      it isn t giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love    aww        sandler and barrymore are a good match and they re assisted by some terrific cameo appearances   including steve buscemi and jon lovitz   whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film    writer tim herlihy   with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher   keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion    it doesn t all work but it s handled with such light heartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans    herlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights   sounds   and affectations of the 1980s    the soundtrack  an ever present force in the film  is packed with wall to wall hits of the period   new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idol s   white wedding   to the smiths    how soon is now      to culture club s   do you really want to hurt me      the mix of music and fashion would make   the wedding singer   a great double feature with   boogie nights      if you grew up listening to the cure and a flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs   then   the wedding singer   is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride    if you re a fan of the lovable   laughable adam sandler   well        let s just say that   the wedding singer   might well be the only film in recent memory to make * me * want to rent   happy gilmore      
Pos, the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man s life   especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances    thematically in cinema   love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters   it is rare   however   for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni s neo classic drama   life is beautiful    through a central cast of father   mother   and son   benigni demonstrates the wonderful   undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times    life * is * beautiful for guido orefice   roberto benigni   directing himself here for the sixth time in his career     an italian jew   master con man   and aspiring waiter extraordinaire    living in 1930 s italy   he lives a carefree life of good fortune   it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora   nicoletta braschi      although dora is already engaged   guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead   the two have a child named joshua   giorgio cantarini      unfortunately for the happy family   the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps    it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie s theme of family love becomes the strongest    although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm   he relaxes the role to ensure his son s happiness    now   instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora   he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right    benigni s performance is truly a well rounded one   and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year    the supports are all strong as well   but the movie truly excels in its script    life is beautiful is a self proclaimed fable   one which tells its story in grand   two part fashion    in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a   saturday night live   spinoff    a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot    but in the movie s second half the script s circular nature becomes admirably obvious    characters make reprise appearances in fine form   and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot s outcome    in all   fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture   and novice movie watchers may take this opportunity to see their first   artsy   film    life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone   and above all is a fine thematic picture

Neg, the working title for no looking back was long time   nothing new   and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture    even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes   it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics    writer/director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline   the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn t spent their life in seclusion    instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings   burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion   offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way    no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful    the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide   and the sooner   the better    alas   that s not the case   and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio    and   to further depress audiences   burns has shot the entire film on cold   rainy days in a gray new york state beach town    peeks of sunshine are few and far between    no wonder the characters are all so miserable    first of all   we have charlie   burns     a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion   then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home    that girlfriend is claudia   lauren holly     and   after picking up the pieces of her life following charlie s departure   she has moved on   shacking up with one of charlie s old school buddies   mike   jon bon jovi      the two have a comfortable relationship   but it s apparent to even a blind person that they re not right for each other    claudia years for some spice in her life   mike wants to settle down and have children    then charlie re enters the mix    so who   if anyone   will claudia end up with    who cares      no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we re not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle    so what if no one finds happiness    these characters don t deserve it anyway   especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time    they aren t real people    they re a writer s construct stumbling through a too obvious storyline    they should know the ending as well as we do    and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two    another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentially interesting supporting characters    blythe danner is solid as claudia s housebound mother   connie britton is suitably high strung as claudia s neurotic sister   and jennifer esposito is eye catching as a bartender in search of a little romance    sadly   all we get is quick glimpses into their lives   although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell    none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes    edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here    jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career   but he could still use a little polish    the worst case is lauren holly   who presents a completely bland claudia    as portrayed here   she s hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moment s interest   not to mention undying love    burns  ex   the monumentally untalented maxine bahns   would have been hard pressed to do a less inspired job    when he released the brothers mcmullen   edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival   robert redford has apparently stuck with him    the aging actor/director executive produced this mess      two films and three short years later   the luster has faded    some movie makers have only one good film in them    with back  to back duds like she s the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers   burns is beginning to look like a member of that undistinguished club    
Neg, what do you get when you rip off good movies like woody allen s bananas and martin scorsese s after hours    you d think you d get the best of both films    instead you get woo    falling in somewhere between def jam s how to be a player   which was awful   and booty call   which was ok     woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing african americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons    the whole film plays out as a black version of after hours   as wild woman woo   jada pinkett smith   goes out on a blind date with straight laced tim   tommy davidson      mayhem follows them    for some unknown reason   read   contrived screenplay   davidson puts up with all of woo s antics for the entire night   which include her destroying his bathroom mirror   stealing things from his house   violently questioning him   accusing and belittling him actually   about previous girlfriends   causing a riot in an elegant restaurant   and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldn t tolerate    but for the sake of this bad movie    sure   why not    there are a few chuckles in the film   the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas    in this case   davidson is running from thugs   gets into a subway car as the doors are closing   starts to taunt the thugs   then the doors open back up again    a good joke   but a stolen one    another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams  cameo as himself    movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so   and not one of them has ever been a hit    woo won t be one either    so why was it made    and more importantly   isn t there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive    everyone involved should really reconsider their careers at this point    [r]

Pos, a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings    a prime example of this is 1999 s 10 things i hate about you   which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school    less successful was last year s adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp   here the setting was the corporate world of new york    now comes o   a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare s tragedies    like 10 things i hate about you   the stage is a high school   a private prep school where odin james   mekhi phifer   is the on court general   the basketball team s standout player    julia stiles   featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke s hamlet   plays desi brable   odin s girlfriend   whose father also happens to be dean of the institution    josh hartnett   pearl harbor   is on hand for the villainy   playing the scheming hugo   who sets the tragic wheels in motion    o was actually filmed a couple of years ago   but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy    the movie   directed by tim blake nelson   best known for his co starring role in o brother   where art thou      and written by brad kaaya   is very grim    an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits    and that is how it should be    of all of shakespeare s tragedies   othello is the most harrowing   not because of any body count   but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago   whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery    kaaya s profane filled script   after all   these are high school kids   does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts    the young man considers himself the basketball team s prime utility man who does a little bit of everything   pass   shoot   rebound   but is constantly in the shadow of odin    plus his father   the team s coach   played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen   showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood    the script follows the familiar lines of the classic    hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi s fidelity   eroding the star s confidence in those he considers closest to him   affecting both his relationships and his game    it all ends in blood   of course   which is why the movie was originally shelved    the performances in o vary    phifer is at first cocky and self assured   emotions he handles with ease    he also does quite well displaying odin s darker side   his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution   his growing distrust of those he loved   his rage and the erosion of his belief system    hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit   turning friend against friend   and lover against lover    stiles seems a bit stilted   but occasionally also rises to the occasion   moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight    the film does contain a few missteps   a subplot involving hugo s theft of the school mascot is left hanging    also desi s actions concerning michael   andrew keegan     odin s former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo s machinations   is puzzling    why she would continually be seen with michael   however innocent the circumstances   when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back    it is irrational    but these are minor carpings    overall   o is a stylish and faithful adaptation    if nothing else   it may encourage some people to read the original text   and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature    
Pos, after the average mouse hunt   the silly small soldiers and the entertaining antz   dreamworks try again with the children s film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story    as the film warns us at the beginning   it s not the full story   and some liberties have been taken   but generally this the bible story we all know and love   featuring burning bushes   the plagues and the parting of the red sea    the only thing missing is charlton heston    instead   we get val kilmer voicing moses   an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt   helen mirren      we flash forward several years to see moses and brother rameses   fiennes   all grown up    moses soon finds out from brother and sister miriam and aaron   sandra bullock and jeff goldblum   that he isn t really the son of the pharaoh seti   patrick stewart   and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule    he soon sets about this   along with his wife tzipporah   michelle pfeiffer      rameses and his two wizard friends   voiced by steve martin and martin short   try to stop moses completing his task    while the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults   for children reared on aladdin and hercules   this film could be the most godawful thing they ve ever seen    gone is the quick fire humour and standard   easy to follow plot    but   spectacularly   and to dreamworks credit   nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on screen    jeffrey katzenberg   who produced this film   certainly knows how to keep a child interested    he s included some songs in the film   plus some comedy   and a exciting chariot chase   to keep the children interested    and somehow   himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across   without ever being boring    it s a remarkable achievement    also remarkable is the animation   which puts hercules   an almost  slap dash  effort   to shame    relying on hand drawn and computer animation   the backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed    the film seems a little caught up with it s amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals and  moving  shots   but they  do  look incredible    the final  plague  where god kills every first born child   and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed    kudos to the animators    the vocal talent is also very good    val kilmer does a fine job as moses   although he doesn t sing   and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses   and he  does  sing      sandra bullock and jeff goldblum are great   and steve martin and martin short are very good   but not in the film long enough    finally   michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife    kudos also goes to the voice of god   who instead of booming and bombastic is quiet and subdued    sadly   he is uncredited   and i couldn t quite work out who the voice was       but e mail if you do      the songs are good   ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional big production number    they don t disturb the movie   and while not particularly memorable   they are nice to listen to   they re well sung aswell      the musical score is suitably epic   with some beautiful tunes    coupled with the superb visuals   the prince of egypt is a visual and aural treat   backed up with a great story    entertaining both for kids and adults   this film is a must see    a david wilcock review   1998     you know   for kids     norville barnes  
Neg, bad   bad    bad    that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls    if that summary isn t enough for you   how about t&a   t&a   t&a    still haven t got the point    other than director russ meyer s predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore mentioned anatomical areas   there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie    that is the fact that it was co written by famed film critic roger ebert   who also was responsible for the screenplay    after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face    this movie stinks out loud    quite frankly   this movie deserves a    but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny    so i m giving it a    and maybe that is too generous    right from the opening credits   i knew that i had a class a bomb on my hands    not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting   but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform    i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening   it does get explained later   and as soon as the first scene is over   we cut to a completely unrelated scene    to be honest   as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was   i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film    with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film   it wouldn t have surprised me if the opening had never been explained    so what is this movie about    you ask    like it really matters    ok   here goes    this all girl band headed by kelly macnamara   dolly reed   and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry    once there   they do manage to find success   due as much to their hooters as anything else   it sure wasn t for their brutally bad singing voices     and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them    everything from big egos   to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral    there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure   but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing    >from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here    other than the above mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have    the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts    mr   ebert has generously thrown in helpings of   hey man       dig   and my all time favorite      this is my happening   and it freaks me out      now i ask you   with lines like that how can you go wrong    ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue    maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter    i don t know   but all the big words in the world wouldn t be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting    but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie    i ve seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey    in fact   there is one scene    the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes    during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries    add to the directing and writing the music in this movie    i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken   there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers    then we have the cast    first lets start david gurian who played harris   the manager of the band    this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera    sadly   his acting doesn t come close to making up for his looks    if you have been following along up to this point   this shouldn t surprise you    meyer s stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets    dolly reed plays kelly   the leader of the band    and no surprise here   she was cast for her cup size   not her talents    and yes   she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents    sadly   her ass is almost as large as her chest    hey   it a sexist movie   so i m writing a sexist review    then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey   one of the other band members    this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie    meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all   but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all    sure russ   now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows    on the up side   she does have a fun lesbo scene    i sound like i m writing a review in a porn magazine    but hey   i ll admit it   the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked    and since that was a huge disappointment   i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey    the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it    unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too    and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d s    you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet    this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs    an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls    beware   this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense    proceed with extreme caution    
Neg, capsule   the much anticipated re adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting   but very little intelligence    visually there is much to like about this version   but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver s travels and treat it as an action film    that makes it a film without much center       0    4 to +4    pierre boulle   author of the bridge on the river kwai   wrote planet of the apes   a   k   a   monkey planet     the novel   as a social satire    it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver s travels    humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed   not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift s island of the houyhnhnms    the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet    it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals   but perhaps i was just looking for that    when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968   he added a number of serling touches   familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling ish    the final irony of the original version has become film history    without it there could never have been a   planet of the apes   film series    i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language    in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language    that could have been done in the film   but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non ape speaking    serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and   of course   there is some justification for that by the end of the film    justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending    but serling never tackles the all important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language   a language they had no opportunity to ever hear    few viewers questioned this serious plot hole   however   and the film has become well respected in cinema history    partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith s best if not his best    when the film s success called for sequels   the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well intentioned   though not very subtle   political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s    while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half  hearted   by the second film   beneath the planet of the apes   there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases    the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973    now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again    for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book   burton s new version is even less faithful    first   he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes    he has them both be intelligent   articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands   uh   make that paws   of the apes    that could be a good story too   but it is not planet of the apes    as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century   the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring    in 2029 leo davidson   mark wahlberg   not this world s most expressive actor   works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes    then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard of oz fashion and drops him on an alien planet       yes   he survives this storm   but then no storm is perfect      he quickly finds   not greatly to any surprise he shows   that on this planet apes rule and humans drool   but everybody talks    and the language they talk is earth  english    apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that    the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film    both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english    in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human animal relationships and more one of the master slave relationships    outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic    leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari   played by helena bonham carter    ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power    she is bent on making the world a better place    perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil ari    in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout   carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film    she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward    it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes    this is a further abandonment of the source material    the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each s place in this reversed society   each important in the book    we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down    we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them    burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn    this is a miscalculation   as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in    they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win    the 1968 script had little subtlety   with lines like   i never met an ape i didn t like     but at least we cared for what happened to taylor   the main character    most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals    the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog    this tends to limit close looks at the makeup    in general it seems much improved from 1968    the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers   who did it for the 1968 version    in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw dropper    it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion    chambers is good   but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker    today audiences have higher expectations   baker s visualization is really an improvement    these visuals work nicely    what does not work is the wire  assisted leaps some of the apes make    they look like they were inspired by the physics  defying leaps of crouching tiger   hidden dragon    apes spring incredible distances    some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture   but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost    one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close up    since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make up    the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti    it is not that his lines are so good   most are silly jokes    but he delivers them very well    he was always a watchable actor   but has not yet made stardom    as the ape trader limbo he over emotes to overcome his ape make up   but does it very well    in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen    he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov s performance in spartacus    as an in joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself    danny elfman s score has a nice primitive feel   but jerry goldsmith s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic    that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten    i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the  4 to +4 scale    
Neg, claire danes   giovanni ribisi   and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists   but they re just about the only palatable element of the mod squad   a lame brained big screen version of the 70s tv show    the story has all the originality of a block of wood   well   it would if you could decipher it     the characters are all blank slates   and scott silver s perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come    by sheer force of talent   the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they re on screen   but the mod squad is just a second rate action picture with a first rate cast    
Pos, in  daylight    sylvester stallone breaks no new ground   cinematically speaking   but he covers familiar territory quite well    yesterday   as i was going about my business in the university bookstore   i noticed this stand with these  daylight  movie posters on it    i had never heard of the movie   so i stopped by to check it out    it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering    so   i shrugged   thought     hey   they probably won t give me the card anyway   and i could always use a free movie     so i signed up    all in all   i don t think i got that bad of a deal   either    rob cohen   who has previously brought us such films as  dragon   the bruce lee story  and   more recently    dragonheart    gee   i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason    you think       now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture   with fx by industrial light and magic   about the after effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey    sylvester stallone plays kit latura   who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in  cliffhanger    a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed    when the crisis hits   he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out    there are other similarities to  cliffhanger    too   perhaps the only real difference is that  cliffhanger  had a villain   where  daylight  s bad guy is mother nature    in fact   had the two movies been made in hong kong   this might have been titled  cliffhanger ii   it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film   sequels   do to their predecessors    the first half hour of  daylight  is setup    subplots are woven   and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled    we meet all the important people       toxic waste disposal truck drivers   a young   frustrated   jilted   rejected playwright   a family struggling to stay together   an older couple and their dog   a truckload of prisoners   an ad agency executive   a tunnel police officer   stallone   and others    we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination   we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons    and then   thirty minutes into the film    boom     and it s a big one    >from there on in   it s sly stallone to the rescue    and rescue he does   enduring batterings   beatings   falls   repeated immersion in 34 degree water   explosions   mud   rats   and constant setbacks   before going on to save the day   sly style    again       there s  nothing new here    and yet there doesn t need to be    the fun of  daylight  is not in the story but in the execution    the special effects are first rate   thanks to industrial light and magic   and the ensemble cast works well together    once the film hits its stride   it carries the viewer right along to the finish   with very few jars along the way    this review is copyright 1996 by christopher e   meadows    permission granted for distribution through rec   arts   movies   reviews and all associated archival    permission granted for free redistribution via cyberspace as long as this message remains attached    all other rights reserved to the author

Pos, many people dislike french films for their lack of closure    while possibly shallow   i ve often had a desire for a sense of epiphany   or at least a resolution   in the films which i view    there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional   however   the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion denying protagonist   stephane   daniel auteuil      stephane   daniel auteuil   is a master violin maker    he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing    even the relationship between he and his boss   maxime   andre dussollier   is a controlled   and almost manipulated association   highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches    in the beginning of the movie   stephane is a closed   solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man    camille kessler   emmanuelle beart   is a master violinist and the new love of maximes    maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife    like stephane   camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved   sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges    when stephane and camille meet   there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals    however   whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane   stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him    stephane ignores his feelings for camille   which the audience cannot help but to see is present    as the movie progresses   the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another    these two people   with very similar approaches to life initially   react to their new circumstance very differently    stephane becomes even more rational and controlled   while camille becomes more tempestuous   until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship    however   their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation    the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well   due to his relationship with a master violin teacher    however   apparently   he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing    consequently   stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays    in contrast   camille had almost given the violin   years earlier    however   with the aid of her manager   she has progressed to being almost one of the world s finest   successfully submerging herself to her playing    during the course of the movie   we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions    stephane attempts to remain unchanged    however   we do see subtle hints of his transformation    one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash    the development of all of the characters   many of which is not included in this synopsis   is incredible    american movies   with rare exceptions   have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development    in its essence   this movie is about the development and growth of the characters   camille and stephane    the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie   including a death   is to further the development of camille s and stepahne s characters    i am not sure why berardinelli says     at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified   and it is to auteuil s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty      this movie is not about judging stephane s actions as being right or wrong   but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are    i find the ending appropriate   unfortunately   i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling    this portion of the film is where the   sense of closure   could have been successfully accomplished    unfortunately   there is a hurried and almost a soap opera type surge of emotions from all of the characters    while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart   ravel has his day in this film    the synergism of the tension of ravel s music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen    the directing in this movie is wonderful    the actors and actresses are excellent   each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth    emmanuelle beart s personality is beautiful    and needless to say   i must say that emmanuelle beart   herself   is beautiful    besides the near ending   the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral    i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of    the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot   has their attitude towards love changed    i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at   but i am unsure of which the director is espousing    in summary   this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship    in the process   we see their attitude towards life and other people    in itself   i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie    where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we   as americans   have preconceived american notions of relationship   love   and people    i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture    however   i   bringing my american preconceptions   enjoyed the film    i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it    
Neg, mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla    his entrance   however   is a grand one   out from the trees he leaps   gargantuan and imposing   sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug   and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have    joe bellows at the poachers before him   angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars    during this scene   i turned to my friend and said     wow    that s some ape      joe is quite a gorilla    a big   digital gorilla    he runs around the fields   chasing cars and people    he picks things up and stares at them pensively    he breaks things on accident   because he s just too big to avoid clumsiness    joe   as a special effect   is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes    as a character   he doesn t quite register    and the story he s been put in is as limp as they come    the words   family entertainment   have never been a stamp of quality   but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart    the picture is a remake of the 1949 film    it s mostly just about the big gorilla   but   strictly as a formality   the movie also has a few human characters    the main one is jill young   poor charlize theron   forced to waste her talent     a lover of gorillas    as a child   she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother   now   she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife    specifically   she s out to protect joe   a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood    soon   zoologist gregg o hara   bill paxton   discovers joe   he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser   rade sherbedgia     who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill s mother    so   in an effort to save joe   jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve   where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers    in addition   the space is way too small for him   after all   he is a really big gorilla      and   to add to the complications   strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext   he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe     and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill s mother    jill   of course   doesn t recognize strasser   even though he did kill her mother    this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young   a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film    the movie isn t really offensive    it has some competent actors   a few nifty sets   and a lot of scenes with a big   digitized gorilla    but the story is really dumb   there aren t any characters   and the film isn t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals    the movie also has bad dialogue    if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue   it s only fair to quote some of it   but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like   joe isn t happy !    and   joe isn t safe here !       we need to get joe out of here !       joe is way too big for that cage !    i don t know if these phrases are word for word   but they re close    as i said   the characters here are only present as a formality   they do little more than state the obvious   of * course * joe is too big for that cage      paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them    sadly   mighty joe young wastes them both    there are a few clever moments   although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment     and   as i said   the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes    it s certainly not a bad film for kids   i doubt joe will give them nightmares    but adults in the audience aren t likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla    a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while   after that   something needs to be done with the big gorilla    nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla    
Neg, talk about beating a dead horse !  when home alone was released in 1990   it was a breath of fresh air   and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely funny family film    the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel   so   two years later   we were subjected to home alone 2   which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited    for john hughes   two home alone movies weren t enough   he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with   including a pathetic box office bomb called baby s day out   last year s live action 101 dalmatians   and this year s flubber    now   inexplicably   hughes has exhumed not only these worn out plot elements   but the   home alone   name as well    the result   1997 s worst sequel   edging out speed 2 and batman and robin     home alone 3    by changing the characters   hughes   who wrote and co produced the film     along with his co conspirator   director raja gosnell   has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest    the new kid   alex pruitt   is played by alex d   linz   one fine day     and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness    he s not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was    the villains   pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern   are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber    in home alone 3   there are four of them   olek krupa   david thornton   lenny von dohlen   and rya kihlstedt     but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls    this time   the kid isn t left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip    instead   he has developed a bad case of chicken pox   so he can t go to school    his dad   kevin kilner   is away on business and his mom   haviland morris   has to run errands   so   for the most part   he s all by himself during the day    through a series of coincidences too irritating to relate   a top secret u   s   air force integrated circuit comes into his possession    it s wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex s home to retrieve it    the eight  year old   who is wise beyond his years   booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains    the movie s climax takes place during a raging snowstorm   only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable    previously   the most counterfeit looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii    these are far worse    in fact   the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near blizzard when a shining sun can be seen    if it s a wonderful life could generate real  looking snow back in the 1940s   why can t home alone 3   which has a significantly larger budget and  90s technology at its disposal    there has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live action cartoon violence for young children    home alone 3 will add fuel to the fire    it s one thing to see wyle e   coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight   but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen    adults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous   but what about five and six year olds    the level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme   many of alex s schemes are nasty enough to kill    but   because this is a   family film     no one dies   despite being electrocuted   falling thirty feet   and getting smacked on the head by a barbell    not only is home alone 3 unnecessary   but it s offensive    it s an exercise in tediousness   and there isn t a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end   unless   by some strange quirk of fate   you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes   and thus haven t seen this stuff before      i can t imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure    maybe that s why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb sucking years    
Neg, this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation    but lo and behold   here comes   switchback     and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as   kiss the girls   and   i know what you did last summer      but   switchback   is an undoubtedly weak genre entry   as the material it covers is old and tired   and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting       switchback   opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she s watching    we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse   dennis quaid     and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while    he is promptly removed from the case   but this conflict of interest doesn t keep him from offering pursuit    lacrosse s most recent trek takes him to a blood soaked hotel room in amarillo   texas   where the local sheriff   r   lee ermey   is torn between his re election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man    in a related aside   former railway worker bob goodall   danny glover   is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup plastered   even on the seatbelts   el dorado    along the way   he picks up    and subsequently saves the life of    hitchhiking loner lane dixon   jared leto      this tangent isn t a random one   as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself    or is the villain in fact lacrosse   only pretending to be after the cold hearted murderer he knows so much about    in a sense   that s half of the basic problem with   switchback      for its first hour   the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator   so we re given little insight into who they are   likely for fear that we ll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction    but   switchback   then decides to explicitly reveal the killer s identity at its midpoint   and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense    some of the acting is a burdensome area as well   probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves    what is danny glover doing here   grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot    and dennis quaid       that monotone    stop it !    ermey is solid in a supporting role that s more interesting than the two leads thrown together   but the charismatic leto   claire danes  object of affection in   my so called life     is a scene stealer tried and true    >from a material standpoint     switchback   is pretty empty    but even when first time director jeb stuart   who wrote   the fugitive   and   die hard     doesn t know what to do   he knows what he wants it to look like    the movie provides some great visuals    the set on a train climax looks good   even though the action is illogical     and the beautiful   crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor    still   that s not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond   and more than the movie s look will end up leaving you cold    
Pos, to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie   mulan is a whole new world    the mouse factory s latest feature is a treasure   featuring magnificent animation   a strong story and finely drawn characters    mulan is the story of a fiesty   head strong young woman who   unlike other disney heroines   isn t seeking her prince charming    mulan s motivations are simple   to save her father   serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say    the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation    the emperor has called for a conscription   one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation    mulan s crippled father is called   but mulan sneaks off   steals his armor and takes his place    mulan is a saga of courage and self discovery    yet   despite the grim backdrop of war   it is a lively tale of self reliance and brain over brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy    the movie utilizes a strong corps of asian american talent as the voices for the main characters   including the wonderful ming na wen   the joy luck club   as mulan   b   d    wong as shang   mulan s commanding officer and later love interest   pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon tek oh as mulan s proud   but loving father    also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon   sent by mulan s ancestors to watch over and help the young woman    his fast   wise cracking   hip talking mushu may seem out of place   but it s a crowd pleasing performance   especially for the youngsters    the movie features only a couple of songs   fewer than most previous disney animated flicks   but mulan s are winners    the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot    the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus    mulan is a treat   more powerful than hercules   with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame    at about 85 minutes   mulan moves rapidly   and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end    mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain    also   it is hoped that the success of mulan   and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle   will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production    it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them    committed to lifelong learning through effective communication  
Pos, ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon   the book of the dead    bruce campbell stars as ash   who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods   and his friends who have become demons   including his own girlfriend      the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film s tiny budget   constant location changes   and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years    followed by two sequels   evil dead ii   1987   and army of darkness   1993      the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it s original aspect ratio of 1   33   1    the disc contains two versions of the film s audio   a stereo 2   0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5   1    included are two separate running commentary tracks   the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film s star   bruce campbell    campbell s commentary is informative and extremely witty   as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film    such informative tidbits include   the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead   and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it s title   and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead   everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard    also   there s a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they ve found that s explaining about the demonic forces in the woods    for that scene   it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana   so being the wacky kids that they were at the time   they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene    almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor s had never smoked before   and as a result they became   confused   and were unable to perform the scene    i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track    the two people you d think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all    don t get me wrong here   when they do speak it s entertaining to hear   but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time    sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask   have anything to say sam      to me   that s not a good sign    also   it seems like sam raimi doesn t remember much about the film and it s production        well   compared to rob and bruce anyway    also included on the disc is a photo gallery   which includes pictures from the film s   gala   premiere   and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film    this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques    overall   the evil dead is a good low budget horror film   superior to many films in it s genre    and the collector s edition dvd release is well worth your time if you re either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process    all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining    
Pos, when i first heard about scream in 1996   i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies    from the master of the horror himself   wes craven   it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them   by making the teenagers do what they know they re not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them   don t run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door   never say   i ll be right back     etc        when i first heard this description   i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie    how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies    was this wes craven s remedy from making   real   bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn    it just seemed cheap to me    then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes   involving drew barrymore and a nail bitingly intense phone conversation   completely changed my attitude    scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick   it s also a pretty scary movie    if you ve seen a million of these kinds of films   you know exactly what is going to happen    this is part of the fun of watching scream    the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent   attractive teenagers    to those who rarely see these types of movies   scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film    there s nothing wrong with that misjudgment though    i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience   the newbies to horror and the fanatics    their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive    from these varied reviews   i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories    films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed   in my opinion   if it was not for the outstanding success of scream    the low   budget 1996 gem may   alongside pulp fiction   be the most influential film of the 1990 s    this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs   tingle or television programs such as dawson s creek but to others such as myself   we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors   screenwriters   and directors    scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly paced script by kevin williamson    within the film are characters who tell other characters   as well as the audience   the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie    mainly from the rants of randy   jamie kennedy   and stu   matthew lillard     we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well   the virgin always survives   have sex and you re dead meat      not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors    the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self satisfaction    in this case   williamson finds these errors for the audience s satisfaction and amusement    i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream   which is a spoof of scary movies    i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream s perfect subtlety    however my last gut feeling about this stuff   scream   was dead wrong        so who knows    
Neg,    something is fishy in the state of universal      about ten years back   with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior   post apocalypse nitty gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies    we ve always had movies of this nature   on the beach   the end of the world   damnation alley   the ultimate warrior   and so on    to date   the most smoothly done were straightforward   haircuts   of the classic western plot   like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization   usually one in possession of some critical resource   like water   feed range   or a mining claim    most of these grew out of venerable   but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane       my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn   which was fairly well made on a small budget      now we have waterworld   which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter       well   she s not a widow   and the kid isn t her daughter   but you get the idea      the lady is helen   played by the stunning jean tripplehorn   who isn t given a chance to be stunning   or even interesting   by the mediocre and unimaginative script    the child enola   played by tina majorino   is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie   she outshines her material all the way through    in simple   the scene is earth   hundreds of years from now    the polar ice caps have melted   and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet    the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies   and survive by trade   theft   or piracy    somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries   and its inhabitants   called   smokers     are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials   so the bad guys have outboard engines   and fast moving boats   airplanes   and jet skis    enola   found at sea as a young girl   has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back    we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical   dryland     the place where trees   crops   and animals grow   and what plot there is hinges on who has enola    the psycho ruler of the smokers   the   deacon     is trying to get her and find his way to dryland    played with typical self lampooning   rug chewing histrionics by dennis hopper     deacon   is the only thing in the movie that s close to amusing    his performance is * almost * laughable   but there just isn t enough there to be funny    the star   and a co producer   is kevin costner    he s playing an un named lone denizen of the sea   a man called the   mariner     who turns out to be a gilled   water breathing mutant with webbed feet    very little is done with this    the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism   it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted   much of the earth s surface would still be above water   and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown       canned meat does * not * last for centuries   ammunition does * not * fire after it s more than a few decades old   and so on   and so on          i m quite fond of tina majorino s previous work   very impressed by jean tripplehorn s past accomplishments   and still speechless over costner s dances with wolves    but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it !  this movie cost one hundred and eighty two million dollars   and there s * nothing * in it we haven t seen before   done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey    at 125 minutes of material   this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make    the budget of this movie * could * have given us over thirty movies   it could have paid for six years of a prime time sf tv series with expensive fx work   or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx    in sum   this movie is beneath contempt    it has nothing new to offer   it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc   and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation    if you * have * to go see it   see it on a four dollar matinee    otherwise you ll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface   for weeks    
Pos,    well this is not mission   difficult   mr   hunt   it s mission   impossible    difficult should be a walk in the park for you         agent swanbeck   sir anthony hopkins     the series  new agent phelps   takes ethan hunt   tom cruise   down a notch    a russian scientist   rade serbedzija   has created a new virus   and its antidote   called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection    a rogue imf agent   sean ambrose   dougray scott     wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company   he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause      posing as ethan hunt   ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure   not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do    the real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff hall   thandie newton   to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods    ethan and nyah fall quickly in love   but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambrose s    reluctantly   he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team    ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah    although the first mission   impossible film was a moderate box office success   audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn t much action   although being a fan of the series both old and new   i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy      that problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible   courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry   robert towne   and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo    the end result is one of the most entertaining   yet simple   action films made in a long while    unfortunately   the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow   dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah s quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission   impossible tv series    ethan s conflict is a compelling one   but it seems very rushed   and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes !      john woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place   featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close ups    the surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film    thankfully though   at the point ambrose discovers nyah s deception   mission   impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action packed    robert towne s screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus    after that   the action scenes just begin to build in intensity   as is the case with many of woo s previous high octane films    the final half hour is an all out assault of action   a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer   unfortunately      as far as summer entertainment goes   mission   impossible ii is serviceable fare    anyone looking for hardcore action won t be disappointed   except for during the first half of the film   perhaps      even if you weren t a fan of the first film   this entry deserves some checking out    [pg 13]

Neg, america loves convenience    after all   we re the culture that invented the cell phone   the 24 hour atm   and my most beloved   the remote control    yet perhaps this time   with ghosts of mars   we have taken our love of convenience to far    ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails   pill poppin    martian cop   sent with her squadron to retrieve   demolition   williams   ice cube   from a remote mining town for trial back home    when she and her comrades   appropriately dubbed   the commander       the rookies     and the guy with the cool accent discover the town s residents slaughtered   they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents  head chopping   alien possessed clutches    filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks   flashes sideways   and viewpoint changes   ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill conceived action sequences    the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story    ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie   ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next   stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose    attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced    most of these moments come off as kwik e mart wisdom   dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even tempered streetwise hand of ice cube    with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other   cube reminisces about his street life   comparing the zombie stomping fun to   me and my brother when we was kids      apparently   crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment    but   even in the film s darkest moments   fate conveniently lends a hand   supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite    yes   in the future   man may travel to space and conquer mars   but nothing beats a good stick of tnt    and as we all know   every police station   past   present   or future   keeps a healthy supply on hand    characters die   heads are lopped off   but they were only supporting roles anyway   so why should we care    as long as you have plenty of narcotics   immunity is guaranteed    eventually though   even the most well trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson    what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation   killing anything the machine guns can t handle    explosions are fun    and even if the nukes don t get them   the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will    in the end this film defines itself when our cop s tribunal pronounces     is that all you have to tell us      for   indeed   john carpenter has run out of things to say   and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story    
Neg, everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here    wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence    billy zane is wooden as the hero    kristy swanson is given very little to do   and does very little with it    treat williams   looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse   is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie    only catherine zeta jones   as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance    she has energy and spunk   which the movie needed much more of    oh yeah   the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you won t even care    about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones   and some colorful scenery    however   if youre looking for a fun family movie   go watch the underrated flipper    this is not a good movie    
Neg, i wont even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films    i saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3   but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them    so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective   alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard days work    i didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful   most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing  but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning    sigourney weaver   whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination   plays the character of ripley    who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3   200 years later   scientists use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley   including the alien that was stuck inside her    in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two   yet ripley is now not completely human   possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being    im sure someone can explain exactly why this is so   but for now well just ignore it and move on    why   you ask   would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated    well   the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature    these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research    they   yawn   were wrong    it doesnt take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un flossed teeth    theres a little saying that goes something like this   if youre going to make a bad film   do it well     i have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies   but they are not the ones that really bother me    alien resurrection   a good example of a film that really gets up my nose   is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one    there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore   which attempts to distract us from the wandering but not going anywhere plot    in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off    another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to    fair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story   but this is unfortunately not the case   and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable    if you think im struggling to find one good aspect about the film   then you thought right    one exciting scene is a credit   and the only part remotely worth seeing   to the film   in which an alien chases two men   one a cripple   up a tall ladder with interesting results    but of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard   and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis    so in a film where the one liners come as bad as earth man   what a shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent   its no wonder why alien   resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is    oh   and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies  the less i enjoy a film   the more i eat    so all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes   but however empty the bag turned out to be   it was still a long way ahead of the movie  
Neg, if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films   i might say that i review movies that don t look particularly good because i m doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it    if that were true   i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads     shay casey   seeing bad movies so you don t have to      but i know that s bunk you re going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say    so i have to tell the truth   every once in a while i get a nasty   masochistic urge to see a bad movie    you know the feeling   when you re sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly    sometimes i think that s why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies   ever    admit it   sometimes you like seeing bad movies    so do i    so i saw   supernova      truth be told     supernova   wasn t quite as bad as i thought it might be    maybe i just felt sorry for the actors   or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn t started tinkering with the director s   walter hill   final cut   causing him to want his name removed    maybe i m becoming a softy    in any case   i didn t find   supernova   as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe    but it s still bad    the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel   nightingale      the crew includes captain a   j    marley   robert forster     his new second officer nick vanzant   james spader     head medical officer kaela evers   angela bassett     medical technicians yerzy penalosa   lou diamond phillips   and danika lund   robin tunney     and computer technician benj sotomejor   wilson cruz      there are some attempts at   characterization     but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction   which puts kaela on edge   yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy faces at each other every five minutes   and benj   apparently gay   is in love with the computer   apparently female      don t expect any more explanation   because you won t get it    anyway   the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent    during the dimension jump   i think that s what it s called   but don t hold me to it     the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal   peter facinelli   is brought on board    he calls himself troy larson   making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with    then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening    have you seen   alien      have you seen   event horizon     a lame movie in its own right      good    then you ve seen   supernova      post production cuts or not   there is nothing original about this screenplay   and nothing unpredictable either    after all   no one s going to think for a second that troy won t turn out to be a villain    but the bigger problem with   supernova   is that it can  t just stick to the simple plot it s afforded    numerous re writes   the script may be credited to three people   but it s a gross underestimate   have crammed this lean 90 minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped    was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot    did the ship s computer learn something about humanity    what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him    and just what does the film s title signify   if anything    as far as i can tell   it refers to a very small plot detail that isn t developed   just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements    character relationships in this film also make very little sense    for some reason   every person in this film keeps having sex    we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes    bassett and spader s characters start off hating each other    fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later   they re engaging in some hanky panky    when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship   of course both female crew members will fall in love with him    every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly   which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut    the most prominent example   however   may be the fact that when the film starts   there are no opening credits !  furthermore   the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits    maybe that s why the film s title is mentioned twice during the end credits   right between james spader and robert forster    right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you re seeing   lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery     you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene   with little to no introduction to any of the characters or situations    the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes   you know   where they explain things   and just went from point a to point b   point a   danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby    point b   tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing    doesn t make sense    since i didn t understand anything about these characters  motivations   did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one by one   and he does   knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes      not a whit    it s a shame   because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do    they don t find it    bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces    sexual tension    more like constipation    maybe they re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as   this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice      not that we ever find out who that is   mind you    the climax of their relationship   taking place in a transport pod   is probably the film s biggest forehead slapper    as troy   peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected    he  s awfully one note   but it s not as if he s given any more notes to work with    the rest of the cast does even less    tunney stands around looking cute   then scared    phillips broods    cruz flirts with the computer    then they all die and a star blows up or something   but i really wasn t paying much attention by then       supernova   is pretty awful   but i m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got    that s it    if you expect it to be good   for whatever reasons you may have     you ll probably hate it more than i will    even the special effects are fairly unimpressive   nothing you haven  t seen before   and suffice to say the script isn t going to save the film    honestly   though   what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym    it usually results in a bad movie   and that s what   supernova   is    
Neg, if the 70 s nostalgia didn t make you feel old   the 80 s nostalgia is bound to    one of the latter set     the wedding singer     seems to be written by someone who did not experience the 1980 s directly but only read about them in an article in parade magazine    the wacky fashions are here            and the music            and references aplenty to celebrities and signs of the times   but it all seems tediously and too obviously inserted for the didn t we dress funny back then chuckle    the plot is standard romantic comedy with nothing original   robbie   adam sandler   is a wedding singer   julia   drew barrymore   waits tables at weddings    both are engaged   however   robbie s fiance   angela featherstone   dumps him at the altar   and julia s fiance   matthew glave   is a skirt chasing speculator in junk bonds    robbie and julia go through the expected ups and downs as they realize they were meant to be together    i ll fess up i ve never found adam sandler funny    whatever his appeal is   i ve missed it       other comedians i don t get include pauly shore and pee wee herman make your own judgments      the stupidity and artificiality of the whole project is summarized in a cameo by billy idol as himself    idol looks like hell   and the ravages of his lifestyle are barely concealed by thick makeup    he s mocked by a photo of his younger self on a rolling stone cover in the same scene    we re not supposed to notice that   and we re not supposed to notice how silly it is that billy idol suddenly appears to play fairy godmother to robbie    other cameos   by steve buscemi and jon lovitz   provide the only real laughs in the movie    lovitz is especially good   playing a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain to take advantage of robbie s post break up depression    
Neg, note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science fiction flick species    squandering an intriguing premise   the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess   widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike    and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success   raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast   ben kingsley s a splendid actor   but a marquee name he ain t      miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film   i doubted that they d dare tempt fate and go for another round    so here comes species ii   with a new creative team   director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman   respectively   that fails to improve the series one iota    like its predecessor   species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid    the film follows the exploits of a young man   patrick ross   justin lazard     whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women   loitering in strip clubs   and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can    in other words   patrick is like a lot of guys   these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age   but there s a catch    he s an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars   and who s now infected with alien dna    patrick s overriding compulsion   to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring    and when he becomes aware of eve   natasha henstridge     a half human   half alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab   patrick s primary focus turns to her      if these two were to mate   the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable   warns dr   laura baker   marg helgenberger   gamely reprising her role   with admirable conviction    species ii opens with the mars mission   and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey looking   even splicing back to dated   grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities    they really skimped on production values this time around    however   this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick   watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship   any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b movie is quickly answered    mr   brancato s original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches    like the first film   and perhaps in homage to it     there s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious    last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room      something bad happened here      this time   laura gets to stand over a fresh   shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter   this is awful      and she s not even empathic !  and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully paced suspense sequence   eve   who s telepathically linked to her alien/human hybrid counterpart   whatever     helpfully tells our alien hunting protagonists     he s going to rape her      while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious   at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own    there s an amusing   tongue in cheek bit of product placement   which doesn t really make much sense   but i appreciated the sentiment     as well as some supermarket related hijinx     he s in aisle 1 !    informs eve      if the film maintained this sort of light hearted tone   it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch   but   to its detriment   it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody   effects ladened anticlimactic conclusion    much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense   and there are such gaping plot holes that it s terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief    the implausibilities are endless   what about the toxic bomb in eve s brain    why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual    my favourite was the slow motion sequence in the film where eve   sporting superhuman strength   is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks    this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief   incredulous that it s being foisted upon the public    returning headlines michael madsen   who reprises tough guy press lennox   and ms   helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay   but there s realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis    mykelti williamson   portraying astronaut dennis gamble   churns out an all too familiar spin on a generic brash mouthed character   and fine character actors george dzundza   playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process   and james cromwell   patrick s neglectful father   senator ross   are utterly wasted in the film    mr   lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty eyed look   while returning vixen ms   henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene   and acquits herself nicely     but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing   or none at all      ms   henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series   claiming that   she s so empowered      a lethal half alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion    now * that s * what i call empowerment    
Pos, on the basis of this film alone   i never would have predicted that   in two years   quentin tarantino would become the country s biggest hotshot director    reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction   but is a much less substantive   more conventional crime story than the big pf    here s what the two movies do have in common          scenes of intelligent   amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot   a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical   chronological sequence   graphic yet necessary violence   an engaging crime story   dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial/gender slurs   three of the same actors   harvey keitel   tim roth and steve buscemi     a mexican standoff ending   although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf  reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it s only got one story to tell rather than three    crime lord joe cabot   veteran actor lawrence tierney   has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist    the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated    instead   they are all given code names off the color chart    mr   white   keitel     mr   pink   buscemi     mr   orange   roth     mr   blonde   michael madsen     mr   brown   tarantino   and mr   peach   tarantino s chin      most of the movie s running time is spent with mr   white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive    mr   orange   meanwhile   is on the floor   dying from a gunshot wound    the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon   leading white to believe one of the five was an informant    the story s background unfolds through a series of flashbacks   of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime    eventually   blonde arrives with a police officer hostage   and what follows is a truly brutal   uncomfortable torture scene    let s just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop s ear    a lot of the time   reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist gone wrong movie   but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino    the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn t live up to   as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on   among other things   tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna s   like a virgin      another scene involves roth s lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana    neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop   like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction   only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie    reservoir dogs is good but it s no pulp fiction    
Neg, one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself    such was the case with boxing helena   1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch   daughter of the great david lynch    made in the dying years of post twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs   it was hyped as another     warped   twisted masterpiece   of lynch clan    kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract    but   the result was extremely disappointing film   which quickly sank into well deserved oblivion    the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh   played by julian sands     talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena   sherilyn fenn     beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair    cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re establish the relationship    during one of such occasions   helena is hit by a car   and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her    after she wakes up   helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh s stylish residence   but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping    she is still trying to escape   so cavanaugh takes off her arms    apart from casting sherilyn fenn   audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart   and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies   this film by ms   lynch hasn t got anything in common with the works of director s more talented father    despite rather bizarre subject   the style of this film is conventional and setting is light   characters are beautiful   but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray    jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic   its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos    the actors aren t good either    julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man   this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains   being neurotic doesn t suit him    bill paxton was better for this role   but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena s boyfriend    sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks   but even the her greater effort in acting couldn t help this film    the screenplay   on the other hand   is awful   at least for someone who had made best seller with laura palmer s diary   the events in this movie are implausible   characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion    one of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh s   regular   girlfriend   played by betsy clarke    the twist at the end   although unpredictable   is unbelievable and the viewers   who had the stomach to endure entire film   would feel cheated    all in all   boxing helena is disorganised quasi artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger s career    
Neg, post chasing amy   a slew of love triangle movies   this month we have kissing a fool   co starring amy s own lee   and april brings us the object of my affection   which may as well be titled chasing allan   for it is the story of a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate       to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it   that film stars schwimmer s friend jennifer aniston      if only kevin smith could write them all        schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max   who falls in love with his best friend jay   lee    s book editor samantha   avital   a mere twenty four hours after meeting her    they are soon engaged   and max   because of his own raging libido   grows suspicious of samantha s fidelity    he convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book   to   test her      the trouble is   jay might be secretly in love with her    to stretch this flat   sitcom premise to feature length   the plot is framed by a climactic wedding   at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular tale  the events leading up to the nuptials  to an annoying fat man and his silly girlfriend    hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film   schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue   and lee   poor lee   is miscast    so hysterically funny in chasing amy   here he is forced to repress his comic instincts   to swear   to yell   to talk about oral sex        the script s idea of a character trait is to stress that jay is a   sensitive man     and then show him drinking pepto bismol when he s stewing over his girl trouble    as for avital   an israeli actress   she is warm and sweet   but we don t know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things    she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer   who plays schwimmer s assistant and personal temptress   turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo    there are a handful   a smattering   of good scenes in kissing a fool    i enjoyed a moment in a comedy club   during which jay gets up and asks   has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her      over and over until he s booted off stage    there are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything that s on the page    kissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night joke machine friends that spawned schwimmer s movie career   so save yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to back    
Pos, scream 2   like its predecessor   is a genre crossing film    it is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery    the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time    scream was also known for its self referential tone    many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven    again   scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as   sequels suck   and   the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels      scream 2 s story is very similar to it s predecessor s    sidney   neve campbell     having survived the killing spree in scream   is now in college    gale weathers   courteney cox   has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film   called stab   which for all practical purposes is the real world movie scream      at the premiere of stab   two students from sidney s college are stabbed to death   and a new story begins    the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer    they want to know all about the links between stab   sidney   and the recent murders    the most complex self reference i saw   this should be an olympic event   was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference    the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers    the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press    the audience was watching the whole   filmed scene       whew      the movie is packed with layers and self references that make it a pleasure to watch    even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2   that s not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep   or even a good movie    the just add to the fun of watching it    i recommend it for other reasons as well    what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural    no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible    it is a person in a mask and a robe   his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims    no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer    the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies   you have less grounds to say   it s just a movie      the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself   gale weathers and deputy dewey   david arquette   also from the original   track down a killer    they are likeable   but not outstanding    but in combination with the horror aspect   the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint    it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream    the internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works   so i wonder if i ll be doing the same thing on january 1   1999    if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high   i ll be happy to mark my calendar

Pos, well i ll be damned        the canadians can make a good movie    the world is coming to an end    we don t know why or how   but apparently there is no way to stop it    the world has had this information for months   as most of the rioting and other assorted chaos has passed and governments have shut down operations    yet for a handful of toronto citizens   life goes on    they aren t going crazy or attacking people in the streets    instead they are simply preparing themselves for the end        some engaging in activities they ve always wanted to do   some gathering with family and friends   and others just seeking to be alone    these people s lives however all intersect during their final six hours    writer director star don mckellar has crafted a highly unique and emotional film    all of the main characters are compelling as they try and do whatever it is they need to do on their last night on earth    craig   callum keith rennie   tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies   a gas company employee   david cronenberg   calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business   and patrick   mckellar   just wants to be by himself but isn t having much success    even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to   tying everyone even closer    things seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of the film   but ultimately everything comes together nicely   although it s not a happy film        some moments are understandably gut wrenching      the story is enhanced by some unexpected humor and very realistic performances   particularly from sandra oh   whose character is just trying to get home to her husband before the end    i have absolutely no problem that the reason for the end of the world is never given   nor does it bother me that the world is ending at exactly 12 midnight   in toronto anyway      but i do wonder why the sun never sets    come midnight   the sun is still shining brightly    maybe the sun is crashing into the earth        who knows    also   it s comforting to know that in mankind s final moments on the planet   people will still gang up on the street for the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus   that s not a shot at this film mind you        i know people are just stupid and truly would be out in the street tipping over cars      last night is available on dvd from universal home video    it contains the film in fullscreen format and includes the original theatrical trailer    [r]  
Neg, when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy   the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass    toss out your usual objectivity   ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it   forget how unbearable it was to sit through   and find some meaningless way to compliment it    this   of course   will be of no service to your readers   but at least you ll avoid the hate mail from the movie s fans    thus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina   not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot      directed by vicky funari as a labor of intense love   she spent the last one third of her life on film   the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez    paulina was a maid in vicky s household when vicky was young    i got to learn the film s background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present    for those without such context   the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film    the acting is amateurish   the story is maudlin   and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie    grainy and overexposed   the movie   shot on 16mm film and videotape   has little to recommend it    confusingly composed   the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story    quite bloody at times   the story   full of horrific images   seems designed to shock and repulse us    why else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8 year old paulina    another scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her    in retaliation   she bites off part of his finger    this covers the both of them in a bucket of blood    the passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner    one   for example   sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body    the lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten    certainly she had to endure a miserable life    but that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good    i felt trapped in the theater watching it    only the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable    paulina runs 1   28    the film is in spanish with english subtitles    it is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers    
Neg, when you ve run out of old tv shows to turn into movies   i guess you try video games    why did i go to see mortal kombat   annihilation    the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw    this film was a bunch of fighting   yelling   special effects   and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack    the plot is fairly simple   a portal has opened between our world and the   outworld     allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn   brian thompson   to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity    the good guys   led by sorcerer rayden   james remar   and human mortal liu kang   robin shou     must take the fight to outworld   where the fate of both worlds will be determined    here s the catch   they must reunite princess katana   talia soto     who s on the good side   with her resurrected mother queen sindel   musetta vander     who s on the bad side   for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanity s safety for another generation    how this is supposed to work   i still have no idea   but i liked katana s line     i knew love would keep us together     since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh    there are some seriously stupid things in this movie    take   for example   a transportation system which utilizes the   inner winds     generated by earth s magma flows    you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast    how fast    as katana says     you will be moving so fast   it will be as if you are not moving at all      what    later   sonya blade   sandra hess   goes to find jax   lynn   red   williams   otherwise known as   saber   on tv s american gladiators   at a medical research facility on the island of oahu    how do we know this is where she went    there s a sign on the facility s perimeter fence that reads   medical research facility   oahu   hawaii    remember   this is not a caption   but an actual sign    i guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are    there s a lot of major flipping action   too    the first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another    do they land and immediately get into the fighting    does one of them land first and catch the other off guard    do they collide in mid air    no   apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away    why did they need those metal balls to travel    everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b    i have to admit   the fight scenes are pretty good   although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires   allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics    the movie s thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly       ouch   was the most common expletive heard when i screened this one    you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights   not plot   would be the main draw   since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next    it seems that s all there is in this movie    maybe it is    as i had mentioned   the acting is bad    there s not one solid performance in the film   although williams as jax was pretty funny    after a fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling   jax says     you look good in mud    no   really   you do      remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously   and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang    brian thompson   who has played good guys   bad guys   and even an alien on tv s the x files   but always some muscle bound behemoth   is your average evil demi god   but it s more the script s fault than his own that he doesn t have anything original to say    the one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and a half    another thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking   blood only appears in one scene    all in all   mortal kombat   annihilation is loud   violent   shallow   and marketed toward kids    hey   just like the video game !  
Pos, whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre   he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms    he made the west dirty in   mccabe and mrs   miller     1971     he parodied hard boiled detective stories in   the long goodbye     1973     and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with   popeye     1980      the same holds true for his most recent film     the gingerbread man     which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years   the john grisham movie    by the time   the gingerbread man   was completed   there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham    there s no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise   matthew mcconaughey   chris o donnell or matt damon   and it doesn t feature a great showdown in a courtroom    instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession     the gingerbread man   is a rain soaked   southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters   a twisting plot line   black humor   a somewhat bleak ending   and even altman s trademark full frontal female nudity    the central character of the film is rick magruder   who is unlike any of grisham s other lawyer heroes    he is older   experienced   and rich   he drives a cherry red $80   000 mercedes that never gets dirty   even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah   georgia   where the story unfolds    rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife   leeanne   famke janssen     and he rarely gets to see his two children   jeff   jesse james   and libby   mae whitman      a reason is never given for the divorce   but it isn t hard to surmise that rick s womanizing had a large part in it    whenever he s late to pick up the kids on his visitation days   leeanne always assumes it s because he s been   screwing around      after an office party celebrating another of his court victories   he hasn t lost in eight years     rick becomes involved with mallory doss   embeth davidtz     one of the catering waitresses    he drives her home because her car has been stolen   and they end up in bed together    rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father   dixon doss   robert duvall     a grungy   stringy   bare footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers    it was actually dixon who stole her car that night   and when rick asks why   mallory replies that he always does   weird   stuff like that    as another character puts it   dixon is   a few beers short of six pack      rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency    he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell   a private investigator friend   robert downey jr       and testimony from mallory s begrudging ex husband   pete randle   tom berenger      dixon is put in a mental hospital   but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out    from there   the story delves into kidnapping   murder   double crossing   and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action    altman s cinematographer   changwei gu   gives the film a dark   soaked look    if it isn t night time   at least it s raining    gu shoots the interiors   which are almost all dark wood paneling   with a minimum of light    a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods   which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability    in the city there is danger enough   but when rick has to venture into the woods   you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world    altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre   from westerns to epic dramas to comedies    but   no matter what the genre   he is always sure to give it the altman stamp   which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings       the gingerbread man   is no different   although his style is much more restrained here    however   without those little touches   the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller    a great deal of the credit for the film s success can be given to the actors   especially branagh   who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction    here   the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl   while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic    rick is an extremely flawed man   but branaugh brings real humanity to his character    without it   the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick s pain and frustration    the supporting actors also put in fine performances   including embeth davidtz   who is probably best known for her heart breaking role as the jewish maid in   schindler s list     1993      tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief   and robert duvall spends most of his on screen time just looking weird    it doesn t seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue   but watch him closely during the film s one courtroom scene   his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language   and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing    while   the gingerbread man   isn t in league with altman s greatest works like   nashville     1975   or   the player     1992     it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking   which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career    some critics love to stamp films like this as   commercial     as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don t make money    altman has done something much better   he took what could have been a generic movie   and by investing artistry and effort   he made it into something more    
Neg,    desperate measures   is a generic title for a film that s beyond generic    it s also a depressing waste of talent   with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles   not to mention once cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not cool flicks    this thriller is more   before and after   than   reversal of fortune      the movie is a big disappointment   and yet it s somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it    the premise is both promising and intriguing    too bad the execution s all wrong   though   because the set up of   desperate measures   boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use    san francisco cop frank connor   garcia   is a single parent with a troubling dilemma    his son matt   joseph cross   is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission    even worse   the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe   michael keaton     currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society    connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery   he s at first reluctant   but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital    when he does make a run for it   connor offers close pursuit   but for different reasons than his superiors   including the crusty brian cox      they want to take mccabe down   while connor needs to keep him alive   or all hope is lost for his little boy    one misstep   desperate measures   makes is in its underdevelopment of matt s illness    what s needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works   there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country   and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow    take   for example   a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital    the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him   and what does connor do    he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight    connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of   and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son    whatever    to be fair   though   the lack of story background is the least of the movie s problems    first and foremost is how cheaply   desperate measures   trades the potential of it s opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour    once mccabe escapes   the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills    there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away    also   the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot inducing   lip smacking villain   the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter   natch   that it completely casts garcia s frank connor by the dullsville wayside     desperate measures   appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist   and the movie s head scratcher of a send off confirms this    there is some good to be found amongst this mess   particularly in the acting department    cast against type   michael keaton s understated menace is highly effective    although he s not given much believable to work with   andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord    joseph cross   as garicia s ailing son   is surprisingly unsentimental   and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos    this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending   but most is lost    it goes without saying that   desperate measures   needs an operation of its very own    
Pos,    dimension films     scream 2    s distributor   has asked press to say extremely little    if anything    about the film s twisty plot    that s no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here   but i will do my best to be vague   now   there s a first           the first one was [good]   but all the rest sucked     said a cinematically savvy teen in last winter s wes craven thriller   scream     her statement referring to the films of the   nightmare on elm street   series but really putting down franchise overkill in general    the comment certainly carries clout   for every truly great sequel   there appears to be a couple of duds   making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas    but like it or not   along comes   scream 2     and believe it or not   it s a doozy    a slick   sinister   madly subversive good time at the movies   as intent on sending up hollywood s sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions       scream 2   is definitely that rare movie thing    a follow up that can stand along side its original with pride    it s been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch esque get ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro   california    those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives    plucky heroine sidney prescott   neve campbell   is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college   her pop culture whiz pal randy meeks   jamie kennedy   has tagged along    trash tabloid reporter gale weathers   courteney cox   has written a best seller based on their ordeal   the basis of which has been turned into a   very bad   movie called   stab      and dewey riley   david arquette     still suffering from wounds inflicted during   scream     has left his job as a police officer for a while    life is tranquil        at least for a while    several sudden murders bring sidney   randy   gale and dewey together again   but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings    if these four people learned anything from the past   it s to trust no one    thus   the possible victim/potential killer list includes said quartet   as well as   derek   jerry o connell     sidney s new beau   cici   sara michelle gellar     a chatty sorority gal   joel   duane martin     gale s cameraman who s not too thrilled with her blood soaked past   hallie   elise neal     sidney s sassy roommate   debbie   laurie metcalf     a local reporter who gives gale some not too friendly competition   and mickey   timothy olyphant     randy s good friend and fellow film student    cotton weary   liev schreiber     the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother s murder in scream   also shows up on campus    but why    like the first scream   craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang    this time   it s an extended sequence that finds an african american couple   jada pinkett and omar epps   attending a sneak preview of   stab     making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non roles of blacks in slasher cinema    before tragedy ensues at the screening   the movie within a movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments   including a scene from   stab   which turns scream s now famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear         b       hang up the phone and star 69 his a   !    pinkett yells at the screen      it s funny   creepy stuff   i don t think i ll ever feel safe in a movie theater again   that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road    another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone assault of the killer on randy   dewey and gale in broad daylight   it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters    there are other superb set pieces   but explaining them risks ruining their effect    there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count    it s something of a trade in    the new characters are too large in number to be as fully developed as the original   scream   gang   but this movie packs in knowing performances   especially by kennedy and cox   and more death for your dollar    it can be argued that   while the original might outclass it by a tad   scream 2 is both scarier and funnier    it certainly doesn t skimp with shocks    a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart   i actually questioned craven and williamson s judgment here   considering how much this person has added to these films      sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab    the two scenes we re shown are dead on    but for film fans   there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like   the usual suspects       aliens   and   the empire strikes back      still     scream 2   does so many things right   it s petty to quibble    its penchant for parody is irresistible   discussions of the merits of film sequels and all    the attractive   solid cast is a definite bonus    and the denouement   while not as shocking as   scream    s   is priceless   the film s final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in   scream   with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper    all this and a   scream 3   is in the works    knowing the series  tendency for self reference   perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice    mentioning   scream 2    ll help them in their argument    
Neg,    ladybugs   is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees   the pathetic team who beats the champs   cross dressing   and the presence of rodney dangerfield    this picture doesn t play like a comedy for children   so who is it aimed at    and why is it told like a 91 minute sit com instead of a feature film    rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee   a total schmuck working at a huge corporation    he obviously doesn t have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead   which he does by volunteering to coach the company s girls  soccer team    what a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie   jackee   know absolutely nothing about the game   and the players seem to know even less    i didn t laugh   but for some reason it didn t annoy me that much    chester s fiancee bess   graff   thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position   and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams    jonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew   who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester   probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team   what original story ideas !      what we get is just another retread of the   underdog sports team   mixed with some cross dressing    unfortunately   the film isn t smart enough to play upon the drag aspect    in fact   it downplays it so heavily it s totally unbelievable    could it be any more obvious martha is a boy    he only wears a girl s wig   without any makeup   and they don t even give him falsies    brandis doesn t bother to mimic a girl s voice either    then there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress   but for what reason    martha is only seen on the soccer field   why would they buy a dress for her    just when we think the martha character is going to be useful   she disappears   and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on    when bess discovers what s really going on she breaks up with chester   and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss    this film could ve been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy   but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary   and bad at that      there s just too much of a sit com feel here   especially during the so called serious moments   and all the confusion between the characters    i ve seen worse movies than   ladybugs     but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm   so even when it turns sour it doesn t seem as bad as it is    dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end   but at what a price    
Neg, all right   all right   we get the point   despite all similarities to the best selling story   speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin    in fact   the script was in development well before 1992    still   the comparisons are inevitable   until one realizes a critical difference    no   it s not that the speechless twosome are speech writers   not campaign managers   it s that carville and matalin s story is actually interesting    speechless is a limp   poorly structured would be romantic comedy    speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign   where kevin vallick   michael keaton   and julia mann   geena davis   meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep    what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign   kevin is a sit com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate s speeches   while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate    at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship   but eventually they let down their guard and become closer    but there are plent of obstacles in the way   including julia s stud reporter fiance   christopher reeve   and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all s fair in love and politics    the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they re crazy about each other    screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other s arms in the first fifteen minutes   then developing the antagonism    it s a noble attempt to shake things up   but unfortunately it just doesn t work    part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do   but in speechless they already know they re attracted to each other   and we re left with waiting for the campaign to end so they ll admit that they love each other already    there is such a herky jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king s sharp dialogue can t prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour    inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton   and with those performances most of their scenes together    the problems begin with their initial courtship   which does virtually nothing to establish julia s character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise ass    davis is radiantly beautiful   and keaton is generally entertaining   but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit    in a couple of scenes   like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain   they actually achieve some measure of connection    for the most part   however   they re just actors spouting lines    you keep waiting for a little spark   and it never happens    perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless s politics    the setting seems perfect for a high  energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix   but that s never the tone that underwood is going for    he wants a warm   fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman s flute and wind musical score   and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background    it might as well have been a story about rival grocers   and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be    i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king s previous screenplay   the dana carvey flop clean slate   so i had some hopes for speechless    but while there is wit in the words   this is a script which was probably much better on paper    on screen   it s still paper thin    
Neg, georges polti once wrote a paper called   the thirty six dramatic situations     in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty six different situations    this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes     there s nothing new under the sun      the faculty   the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez   certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion    there s not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing    drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers   screenwriter kevin williamson   of scream 2 credit   gives us a horror tale set in middle america   ohio   one eventful fall    making use of a cast of unusually stock characters   williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day style but rather   through the back door      parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run down high school and soon have infested most of the student body   leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day    the lack of gusto is the movie s major stumbling block    even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this   they ve been saved by an energetic approach    this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson s ability   who enjoyed success with the wes craven directed scream but couldn t pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer    although he designs the faculty with more of a sci fi bent than his typical slasher picture   it still comes down to the same results   throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive    on that level   the main roles are played by virtual unknowns    only the recognizeable elijah wood   deep impact   is at the front   other than that   the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers    perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up and comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved   but to do that   they d all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la   dawson s creek      needless to say the acting is far from top notch   nor does necessity ask that it should be    there is a moment or two of genuine horror   but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci fi direction to make any use of it    in sum   the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off    
Neg, i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series    if there s a will   there s a way   and i believe that anything   no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon    this is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sant s universally panned update of psycho   i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience   but also very on par with an original    but i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad    you see   the point of a remake is   or at least it should be   to iron out the original s flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection    but what if the source material on which the remake is based isn t any good to begin with    that is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad    i ve only seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which it is based   and to be honest   i didn t like it all that much    it has a concept that    and still is    interesting   a group of corrupt young adults   all in their early 20s are given a choice   they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed   or they can become undercover cops   helping the police get into places that they normally wouldn t be able to access    obviously   all 3 opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen   and policewomen      the three main characters here are played by claire danes   omar epps and giovanni ribisi    of the three   only danes has a real character    ribisi s dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs   epps  slightly more intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes    when the squad s superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death   the three of them   sure that their beloved master was framed   go off and investigate on their own   discovering corrupt cops   lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations    all kinds of good stuff !  the only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments    although ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie   his man here is really rather amusing   when the script gives him a chance    epps  straight man is effectively played against ribisi s clueless spontaneity    but the rest of the film is dull   boring and singularly uninteresting    a drug op action plot is no longer anything new   not even with teenage action heroes   and the way it s executed here   it s also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful    claire danes  character has potential   but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained    she could have been a tour de force   but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role    epps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected   although their characters aren t nearly as rich as danes  could have been    the mod squad is a mind numbing marketing plot of a film   and teens will jump all over it    it s full of bad dialogue   scenes and concepts that make no sense and    get this    drug dealers that like to tango with other guys in their spare time    nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for    claire danes is no longer alluring    mainly because she s got a horrible hairdo   so that draw is out    there are   however   cool explosions   guns and chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of some sort    do not be fooled    some may call this escapist fare    i call it escape as quickly as you can fare    
Pos, in arguably the most anticipated movie this century   george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster    despite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down   the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence   in the sound and special effects department    in terms of characters   by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala   natalie portman     whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age    she is one   hot  babe who defines true   woman leadership     she not only has a presence   but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination    no thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force   lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything    the young obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor   who has a bad hair day in every scene   gets to kill a bad guy in the end   but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero    in fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual   there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners    i mean it would be interesting to see yoda s girlfriend for a change   if he has one    not much better is qui gon jinn   liam neeson   who mostly broods   and has a better hair do than obi wan   but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life    also fascinating is george lucas   metoclorian  theory   which claims that micro organisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe    and it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force    more humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader   no doubt a concept stolen from the christian faith   except there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force    overall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that it s predecessor almost command a viewing of this inferior successor    by all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan    watch out for the next one   it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker   who i believe should be portrayed by   leonardo di caprio    
Pos, in zoolander   the world s most successful   influential and intellectually challenged male model derek zoolander wonders     is there more to life than being really really really good looking      obviously   the film s creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short film subject   can there be more to this film than being really really really silly    no   of course not   and it never aspires to be anything more    much like derek   zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie    it s not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy   and it never produces any gut busting laughs   except maybe a scene when derek s model roommates all die in a tragic   gasoline fight   accident    a riotously funny take off of tommy hilfiger ads      but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles   wild characters and performances   and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused    better yet   this exaggerated version of the original three minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes    just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag    zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia   since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs    fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu   will ferrell   drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed    enter derek   whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel   owen wilson   takes the spotlight    on the trail of mugatu s plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries   stiller s real life wife christine taylor     and she s hoping to use mugatu s pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme    much like the austin powers films   zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved   and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today    wilson is hysterical as the young   vain hansel    ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant   freakish mugatu in the same way dr   evil upstages everyone in austin powers    jerry stiller    ben s dad who s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld    makes a priceless turn as derek s slimy agent maury ballstein    even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged   large assed masseuse    as for ben stiller   it seems his derek has one gag   he s stupid   which plays out in some uproarious one liners    unfortunately   taylor seems out of place and out of her league here    maybe it s just because i can t stop seeing her as marcia brady   who she played in both brady movies     making her unbelievable as a dowdy   brainy plain jane who hasn t had sex in two years    she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo   who would ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role    while zoolander is hardly highbrow   its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times   especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days    zoolander s no masterpiece   but a very worthy distraction    
Pos, many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come   the new film by visionary director vincent ward    most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors    but little do they know   as i so plainly found out   that this has quite a complex story to tell    walking out of the theater   i could see the audience s disgust        one member even had to be awakened after the film ended    don t believe the previews that you see        this is definitely not a film for everyone    this is quite possibly one of the most adult oriented films to come out in recent years    kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline    the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us    it goes back and forth in time   as if it has no boundaries    think of the film city of angels    now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision    both films deal with the afterlife   but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office    costing around $85 million to make   the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it s money back    but due to it s story   i doubt it will    for everyone who thought titanic s story was too simple and cliche   here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay   it may not have done nearly as well    but don t get me wrong        i hope the film does do well    it s a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen    i doubt most of us could have thought of this place   even in our own mind    what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals    the only film that surpasses it is dark city    full of rich   shocking colors   we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to    but don t do that   because you ll end up going to hell    what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake    chris   christy   nielsen   robin williams   is startled by the sudden jolt   but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat    annie   annabella sciorra   spies chris   as well   and both eventually bond and get married    annie is an artist   whose paintings are colorful   lush   and surrealistic    chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself    they also have two children   marie   jessica brooks   and ian   josh paddock      but one day   the two children are killed in a car crash   and it almost destroys annie    she tries to commit suicide   but fails   and is then put in an institution    chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren t around anymore   and nothing will change that    just as annie gets her life back in order   chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim    chris goes to heaven   or his version of heaven   rather    guided by albert   cuba gooding   jr       chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy    that is   until he realizes how miserable he is without annie    prior to heaven   he would try to comfort annie   but the more he was around   the more pain she felt    chris decides to leave her alone    little does he realize what will happen next    i m not about to say   because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story   many critics   however   give it away      certainly   chris dying is crucial to the plot   but they tell you that he dies in the previews    story is not necessarily important for this movie to work   because it deals with the afterlife    however   strangely   virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil    a couple of comments here and there   but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life       we re soul mates !    chris exclaims    heaven   in movies   is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white   purity   and love    usually   it also looks like it rests among the clouds    but what dreams may come goes a different route    it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before    chris  heaven is his memories brought to life    his thoughts can make anything real   and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven       i ve never seen anyone use real paint before     albert says    equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone    instead   it s a state of being    in one gloriously horrific scene   chris and his   tracker     max von sydow   arrive at a sea of faces    thousands of heads are stuck above ground   their bodies somewhere else    mostly dead silent   some quips are made   almost as if to lighten the mood    it s truly a frightening sequence    production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination    using state of the art computer technology   worlds are created for exploration    sometimes   some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact    it s not necessary to be there   but we appreciate seeing it    costume designer yvonne blake   who also appears in the film   has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes    cinematographer eduardo serra   whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove   has a difficult job   as most cinematographers do working with special effects    but serra s entire universe is a computer generated image   and he does a masterful job    writer ron bass   adapting from the novel by richard matheson   provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot    the story is extremely vague in its details   allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning    and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision    what dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience    your average movie goer more than likely isn t used to expressionistic techniques    the film will also definitely draw attention from religious people   but they shouldn t take it too far    it is   after all   just a movie    robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances   while his comedic roles have been suffering    his comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff   but when is confined by a screenplay   he isn t quite as effective    but drama is really his strong point   and you can see that here    it s doubtful he ll get another oscar nomination   but i wouldn t really mind if he did    the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land    this may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention    it s also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination    however   the academy doesn t like to award performances for these types of films    cuba gooding   jr   has been better   but he s certainly not distracting    max von sydow is underused   as are jessica brooks and josh paddock    a treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear   if they even recognize him   as chris  father lost in the sea of faces    it s not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film   considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images    overall   it s williams and sciorra s film    what dreams may come is rated pg 13 for thematic elements involving death   some disturbing images   language   and some partial nudity    the film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience    some will find the plot distracting    some will find the visuals absolutely glorious    and some will find both    the only real problem with the film   that i could see   was that it slows down considerably during the midsection   just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins    by the way   some controversy even surrounded the title   which was mistaken for a sexual term     what   becomes   wet   and you should understand      in actuality   the title is from a soliloquy in hamlet    just thought i should let you know    
Neg, play it to the bone is a punch drunk mess of a movie    containing a good cast but awful acting   an interesting premise but terrible execution   ron shelton   white men can t jump   gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two    rocky no   1 is vince boudreau   woody harrelson   edtv     a bald   tattooed   newly converted christian   whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word        something that he has not yet successfully achieved    rocky no   2 is caesar dominguez   antonio banderas   the 13th warrior     best friend of vince who is currently dating vince s ex girlfriend   grace    both men are nearing the end of their   almost   careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity    when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated   the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement    our boys are tapped to fight each other   the winner of which is   promised   a shot at a future title fight    the film is divided into two sections    at first   we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes   in grace s   sassy grassy   green muscle car   travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day    along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by    once in vegas   the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar    both mr   harrelson and mr   banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past   not that we d know it from their work here    mr   harrelson is uncomfortably awkward   apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince    the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable    mr   banderas is uncharacteristically non charismatic as caesar    weak and ineffectual   there is little life in his screen performance    the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another    tom sizemore   saving private ryan     robert wagner   austin powers ii   the spy who shagged me     and richard masur   fire down below   are crooked promoters   lucy liu   payback   is a sex starved hitchhiker looking for a good time   and lolita davidovich   gods and monsters     is the shared girlfriend who can t make her mind up which boxer she prefers    because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them   the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins    but even then   because the outcome is so predictably obvious   the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other    writer/director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed   well choreographed   well edited   and well performed    if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film    as it is   the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable    the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film    the phrase     play it to the bone  is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you ve achieved your desired goal    that is a biblical principle       know ye not that they which run in a race run all   but one receiveth the prize    so run   that ye may obtain      1 corinthians 9   24 [kjv]  achieving anything worthy in life requires   playing it to the bone      we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives    this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives    as a movie   play it to the bone is hardly worth our time    but as a principle of life   the phrase   play it to the bone   are words to live by    
Neg, that s exactly how long the movie felt to me    there weren t even nine laughs in nine months    it s a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man   mr   hugh grant   a huge dork    it s not the whole oral sex/prostitution thing   referring to grant   not me   that bugs me   it s the fact that grant is annoying    not just adam sandler annoying   we re talking jim carrey annoying    since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting    but   on the other hand   since when do really bad slapstick   a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant s head in joan cusack s lap  a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie   and obscene double entendres   robin williams   the obstetrician   tells grant s pregnant girlfriend she has   a big pussy     referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat   but nonetheless   grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie   pass for comedy    nine months is a predictable cookie cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot    hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist    why a child psychologist    so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange    kid   my dad s an asshole    grant   flutters eyelashes   offers a nervous smile   then responds in his annoying english accent and i think i actually have  talent attitude     could you possibly elaborate on that    kid   my dad s a  huge  asshole    more like a hugh asshole   but that s beside the point   which is   nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief    so   anyway   grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction   fluttered eyelashes   nervous smiles      this paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book   especially since grant s equally annoying friend s wife is also pregnant    the annoying friend is played by tom arnold   who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick   none of which is funny   such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed   arnie the dinosaur     you draw your own parallels on that one   in a toy store    the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum   who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway   as an artist with a fear of   and simultaneous longing for   commitment    not even robin williams   who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics   has much humor    his is a one joke character   the old foreign guy who mispronounces english stereotype   did someone say yakov smirnov    that s my favorite vodka   by the way     hence the line   now it s time to take a look at your volvo     another nasty but unamusing joke   except this one goes right over the ten year olds  heads   while the adults simultaneously groan    nine months is a complete failure   low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud   unfunny slapstick   failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy    hugh grant s sunset boulevard arrest   please   no caught with his pants down jokes   may bring more people into the theaters   but they certainly won t leave with a smile on their faces   not after 90 minutes of grant s nervous smiles    everything in the movie is so forced   so unauthentic that anyone with an i   q    over 80   sorry   hugh   will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire    but at least they didn t spend 60 bucks for it    
Pos, titanic is   without a doubt   the best movie i ve seen all year    and believe me   i m not an easy critic to impress   the english patient was too long   men in black was over hyped   and several of the   big summer releases   were dead in the water    thank god this film got delayed until december    it s my christmas present    titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years gone by   and it is truly a stunning film    while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized   never taking your eyes off the screen   nor checking your watch to see how much longer it s gonna last   despite its 3 hour plus running time    as a friend of mine   who s a true titanic buff   said   if someone doesn t like this film   it s because they didn t want to      truer words are hard to come by    of course   it doesn t hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors   james cameron   who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time    if you wish to argue that point with me   look at his list of credits   the terminator   aliens   the abyss   terminator 2   true lies   etc   still care to disagree    not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film   he also wrote   produced   and edited it    and to show his true faith for the project   he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs    it s obvious he truly loves titanic    the film opens with footage   both real and fake   of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic   where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the   heart of the ocean     which   according to bill paxton s character   would be worth more than the hope diamond today    their search turns up   dissapointly   no diamond   but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond    this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose   who claims to be the girl in the picture    she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond    almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past    rose s narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl   engaged to a rich man named cal hockley   billy zane   that she didn t want to marry    her mother is pushy and obnoxious   and cal hockley is arrogant    they are boarding the titanic   which is sailing to america   and this is where she is to marry cal    meanwhile   a young man named jack dawson   leonardo dicaprio   and his italian friend   danny nucci   win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game    they are overjoyed   and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving    for them   this is their ticket to america   to a better life    for rose   she is sailing to her doom    the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt   kate winslet   and jack dawson fall in love    it s the classic wrong side of the tracks story   and does sometimes resort to a few cliches    but as i said above   the love portion isn t sappy and doesn t   weigh the film down     as some critics have said    it s sweet   and it didn t make me restless at all   despite the fact that i usually hate love stories    of course   it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen    most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912   including the enigmatic molly brown   played by the talented kathy bates     the captain of titanic   bernard hill     and so on    all of these characters add an extra depth to the film   and make it that easier to watch    of course   things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark   where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom    the sinking is depicted realisticly   and the effects are truly amazing    it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either   as people are portrayed as panicking   pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats   and drowning and dying horrible deaths    the best part of the movie   in my opinion   comes at the very end   when we flash back to the future    the crew   who at first had been skeptical of rose s story   now are totally aborbed by her    rose goes out onto the ship s ledge   and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard    we then see a dream of rose s   in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson    most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream    however   i think it symbolized more   i think it meant that rose had died   and is going to a sort of heaven   which would be the happiest part of her life   her and her one true love   jack    if anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this   e mail me at venom8@hotmail   com    
Neg, woody allen is one of the most successful artist directors in hollywood   but he is becoming less and less reliable as a filmmaker    in his early years of film making he mastered the simple comedy    from there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles    some of these work better than others    zelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist    deconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back    harry block   allen   has in his life only two drives    he wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing    the story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments    perhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harry s life by editing harry s scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out    as a writer   harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises    the film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harry s books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harry s life    these fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion   but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters    it is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person    if that sounds complicated   it is    then as another device in one of the stories   an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image    harry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time    as if these touches did not create sufficient confusion   the story is told out of chronological order    if allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding   any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable    but allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand    deconstructing harry is set at a time when harry s old college   the one that expelled him when he attended it   wants now to honor him for a lifetime of writing achievement    harry is searching among his friends to find one who will go with him    just why someone who is so unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear    harry tries his current girl friend fay   elizabeth shue   only to find that she is about to marry harry s old friend larry   billy crystal      block would like his son hilly   eric lloyd   to accompany him   but hilly s mother   previously first harry s psychiatrist and more recently his wife   refuses to let her son see his father    another friend richard   bob balaban   would go but has health problems    harry also considers bringing a prostitute cookie   hazel goodman      it is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite   but cookie is considerably different  black and a lot brighter than mira sorvino s character in the previous film    while the comedy sequences are never complete   a few are elaborate and some quite funny    the centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell with allen playing a sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil   who looks a lot like larry    that story also is left uncompleted   perhaps to show harry s unwillingness to commit even to telling a story    the linchpin that was needed to tie together the stylistic quirks of this film was a central character who changes and who gives us something about which to care    that character is patently not the one allen creates in harry block and not the characters around harry as seen through his acerbic eyes    allen can do much better than deconstructing harry    i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a  1 on the  4 to +4 scale

Neg, `the skulls  is a laughably bad thriller   a teen orientated doppelganger of `the firm  so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor    certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter    i chuckled incessantly   all the way home    let me share    the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale   designed   i m sure   to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college      luke mcnamara   joshua jackson     a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year   highlights the latest skull scouting report    despite some anxiety and caution from others   luke accepts entry into the organization    soon after   he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women   driving a new car and marveling at the $20   000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account    yeah   dude   pretty good deal eh    but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating   when circumstances become extreme   there is no way he can leave the society   except maybe as a drooling vegetable    the premise   although lacking in originality   certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense    unfortunately   `the skulls  is neither intriguing   nor suspenseful   nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting    it s just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack   the stars          but not the script    `the skulls  is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value   with the screenplay   by jon pogue   immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers    first off   upon their initiation into the skulls   each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm    afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar    will they never take this watch off    and what if they forget it by their bedside    perhaps their   secret  society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed    on top of this   they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters    gee   why not member t shirts    but my favorite bit is this   the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual   agree  or   disagree  notions when making collective decisions    they are given official skull paddles    when flipped to one side   they indicate the member agrees with the proposal    facing the opposite way means a disagreement    wouldn t they merely express themselves verbally    hell no    they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote   and maybe afterward they can play ping pong    i m still chuckling about these ludicrous details   but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest    the cast   meanwhile   combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `dawson s creek  crowd   and fuses the two together   ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout    but not entirely    accomplished actors like craig t   nelson   as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake   and william peterson   as fellow board member senator levritt   are dealt pathetic villain caricatures   and look suitably embarrassed handling them    and then there s christopher mcdonald   who has the capacity to be a fun   exciting actor    mcdonald s charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role   yes   pogue makes it a hat trick      i pray it was a `snatch the paycheck and run  exercise for all these actors    the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better    let s cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character    paul walker   the strapping quarterback from `varsity blues    is bland but passable as caleb mandrake   the judge s son    walker preserves a straight face   even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie   `dad   i just killed a guy in the ritual room !

Pos, back in 1998 dreamworks unveiled their first computer animated movie   antz      the film was critically acclaimed   and went on to gross almost $100m dollars at the domestic box office    again in 1998 they released their traditional animated film   the prince of egypt   and it named an instant classic   and became a huge hit as well    on a winning streak   they released   the road to el dorado   and it wasn t as big as they hoped   but still did ok   then they had the fantastic   chicken run   in the summer    now in 2001 dreamworks has released what i can safely name   one of the top five best animated films    shrek   mike myers   is about a loving   green ogre who lives in the woods of duloc by himself    surrounded by fairy tale characters   he hopes somehow he would escape from everyone    the ruler of duloc is the short   heartless lord farquaad   john lithgow     who is offering a reward to all the fairy tale creatures   if they are captured and arrested    of course many of the owners turn them in for gold and silver   but one of those creatures is donkey   eddie murphy      a regular donkey   except he talks and has a definite attitude   after his owner tries to disown him   he escapes into the woods   and runs into shrek    lord farquaad however   has different plans and makes all the fairy tale creatures in the woods near shrek s house    to get his property back   and his life back shrek must rescue princess fiona   cameron diaz   so lord farquaad can be a king    shrek wants his property back   but he never thought he would fall in love with princess fiona       shrek   is such an amazing film   that while watching it you can t help but just smile the entire time and wonder why that other production company can t make movies like this    the animated graphics are so great   that they look every bit of realistic    i saw previews for this film all last year   and i thought to myself wow   what a great movie this will be    i must say i was not disappointed at all   and the film is the best of 2001 so far   and will go down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year    the voice talents are brilliant as well   with the comic genius mike myers    in the past he has been a wayne   an austin   and a person married to an ax murderer    now he is shrek   not only does he do the voice talent       but he is shrek    with his irish accent   and he lovable personality   shrek becomes a friend to the audience and warms your heart    eddie murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s   mulan   does another bang up job here   and he is the comic relief in the film    the tones of his voice   the lines he utters   and the jokes he gives   he even outdoes the comic genius of robin williams in   aladdin      the always beautiful cameron diaz gives the voice of princess fiona and she does a great job as well    she is very funny   and her character fits her to a t   of course the best supporting voice is john lithgow   who is personally one of my favorite actors    he as the bad guy lord farquaad does a great job in being both sinister and funny at the same time    at times i was so amazed by the computer graphics   that you can t help but just start looking at backgrounds    there is many hidden jokes in the film   and even reflections of light on the screen like a camera       shrek   is a definite kid film   but not just a kid film for it is a film for the entire family to enjoy    there are many adult jokes in the film that the kids won t get   but the parents will be laughing    believe me though   everyone will be laughing the entire way through    in the end     shrek   gives a very important message to it s audience to enjoy and be who you are    everybody out there is beautiful in their own way   even though it may be inside    there s not many words that can praise   shrek   enough   but my words to you is to stop what you are doing and see this movie now    
Neg, i didn t hate the big hit   even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film    for the entirety of its running time   my eyes were attached to the screen   and i never once got bored    i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness   this is such a confused disaster of a film that it s entertaining to watch it in the same way that it s entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl    as a narrative   the big hit is pure garbage   never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries    it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank   which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways    it s fine to mix genres   if the film makers know what they re doing    unfortunately   writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don t seem to know how to handle the material   and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy    the biggest problem with the amalgamation   in this case   is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place    but it sure is a fascinating failure    marky            er   mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley   a hitman    he s a good hitman   apparently   although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious   he doesn t snipe or make clean kills  he just kicks the door down and shoots everything      he works with a few other hitmen  cisco   lou diamond phillips     crunch   bokeem woodbine     and vinnie   antonio sabbato   jr        they re a nice bunch of muscular guys   who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex    they all work for a man named paris   avery brooks     who is rich   powerful   and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen    it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own   this   of course   is where the plot comes in    they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko   china chow     who has a rich father    when they do this   it turns out she is paris             goddaughter !  it s very bad to have paris against you    the story is standard action film stuff    it s nothing new   and nothing particularly offensive   but certainly not the slightest bit compelling      clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it s a john woo type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy    it s true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea   such as face/off and the replacement killers   which are both far superior      there are stunts that are fun to watch   the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story    they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns    melvin is also very good at breakdancing   and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives    like i said   it s not boring   most disasters aren t    what makes it so bad is its genre shifting madness    it seems to start out as a quirky but realistic action comedy   as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains    then   as soon as they go to their first hit   it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere    then   somewhere in between   it turns back into comedy    keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl   in one amusing scene   she is forced to read a letter out loud   indicating that she has been kidnapped   but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words    and scenes like this work alone   but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious   or not be in the film at all    one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped   when cisco gets there   paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it   but they let him out of there   telling him to find the perpetrator    the scene is played for laughs   but it isn t funny    and since it doesn t quite work as a comedy   it tries to fall back on the action   which also fails    this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun    cars land on tree branches and are supported by them    characters betray each other without a second thought    grenades are thrown in tight places    people jump out of tall buildings and survive    people outrun tumbling cars   and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds    most frustrating of all   though   is the film s definition of a hit man   these guys are anything but subtle   quiet   and skilled individuals    they re more like socially depraved militia men   melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage   including missile launchers and hand held machineguns      the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest   this obviously doesn t make for deep or interesting people to watch    the acting is kind of fun   though  wahlberg is a good actor   and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way    phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character   while christina applegate   who plays melvin s fianc   e   is convincingly air headed    the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny    the funniest parts are supplied by the actors   and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one liners    it s a true disaster   one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional    despite all this   though   i must reiterate the entertainment value here    you can cherish the awfulness of a film like this    if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is   you just might enjoy yourself    
Pos, it must be tough to be a mob boss    just ask paul vitti   robert deniro     a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing    i can believe it   too   one can t even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he s forced to choose between an ice pick   baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with    suffering from reoccurring panic attacks   paul decides he needs to consult some professional help    and who better than billy crystal    after appearing in bottom of the barrel flops   father s day and my giant   crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here    playing vitti s private shrink   the two very different stars strike an unorthodox   but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish    casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in joke   i think    placed in this mobster s shoes   deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather   part ii and casino    it s obvious he s having a lot of fun doing so    the man behind the camera is harold ramis   whose credits include ghostbusters   as writer and star     and his best directing effort   the bill murray vehicle   groundhog day    ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what s funny   and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors    the only character who weakens the payoff is crystal s bride to be   lisa kudrow      playing the same dumbed down role as she does in friends   kudrow is amusing   but doesn t fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped    the supporting cast sparkles    joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly   vitti s pea brained right hand man   and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster who s in desperate need of the definition of `closure     the movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout   putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides    the situation is just too cute to resist    it s unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand    but hey   if you re in the mafia   using obscenities probably comes naturally    and near the end   seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat    
Pos, natural born killers is really a very simple story that   in essence   has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis   mood and degree    both films glamorize   outlaws     in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers    both relate the story of a couple liberated by love    but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle   natural born killers is total and blatant    where bonnie & clyde was social   natural born killers is psychological    what bonnie & clyde hinted at   natural born killers confronts and explores    what bonnie and clyde stole   mickey and mallory kill    to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them   expressed metaphorically as killing   subdues the mysterious power this film wields    for the most part   when mickey and mallory kill   they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily   they kill what is trying to kill them   they kill what dissembles and cowers from life   they kill what needs to be killed    this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity    brahma created    vishnu preserved    and siva destroyed   but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma    the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate   i m forced to say it for clarity s sake   a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes   that is   destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics    your plumber   bonnie and clyde   mickey and mallory   and siva are all productive destroyers    i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death   presently and historically   than any other phenomena    muslims kill christians    hindus kill muslims    christians kill pagans    jews kill christians   etc   you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged    religion is an orgy of killing    the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn t been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable       the state is the divine idea upon earth     hegel said   meaning it is absolute   all powerful   ineffable   unassailable   infallible   authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh   allah   god   etc    well   what does all this have to do with natural born killers    let me first say that religions of this nature   in the ideal   take the place of sex    consider the catholic church   which in its hey dey   took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever    god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope   cardinals   bishops   monks   etc   they forego the one   in order to come closer to the other    during the middle ages   when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged   the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power       parenthetically   witness plato as well    in the republic   he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime    not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself   regularly assailing the passions      catholicism   as policy   attacks the passions as evil    it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure    masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution    this is religion   this is authoritarianism in its essence    as further evidence   the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters    our culture   most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years    we can t help but adopt   even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes   leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self    mickey and mallory knox internalized them   too   then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other   discovered them   and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves    it is a straightforward liberation through sex    as some good patriarch once observed     you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on      m&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions    they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions       the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers     as mickey says    as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter   let us look each other in the face    we are hyberboreans  we know well enough how remote our place is       neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans     even pindar   in his day   knew that much about us    beyond the north   beyond ice   beyond death  our life   our happiness          we have discovered that happiness   we know the way   we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth    who else has found it     the  man of today        i  don t know either the way out or the way in   i am whatever doesn t know either the way out or the way in     so sighs the man of today          this is the sort of modernity that made us ill  we sickened in lazy peace   cowardly compromise   the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay    this tolerance and largeur of the heart that   forgives   everything because it   understands   everything is a sirocco to us    rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south winds !  as far as i can tell   this is what the movie has to say    its alleged critique of the media is only secondary   tertiary   quaternary   subsidiary for sure    for example wayne gayle s first report ends with some gen x dude saying     if i were a mass murderer i d be mickey and mallory     in his most excellent bill and ted voice    on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical   impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes    it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he d be just like them   killing and destroying what deserves it    let me exemplify what i ve been saying by analyzing a scene from the film   namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant   kills him   and then castigates him for giving her   the worst fuckin  head i ve ever had in my life ! ! !    now   i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship   because demonstrably they didn t   and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this    sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations   but unwilling to kill each other   since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation   they must kill in place of their lever    it s no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey    as the attendant approached he took on mickey s character in the eyes of mallory    she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory    upon discovery   mallory views this as a betrayal   judges him   and commutes his sentence on someone else    the style of the movie is a whole  nother matter that i won t get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power    let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness   barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle    the rapid succession of all those 8mm   16mm   35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish   frenetic mood    also   jungian archetypes abound    these can t help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames    some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind     quotes are paraphrased only      mickey to mallory     one of these days i m gonna be cummin  for you     in prison   while mallory jacks mickey off    semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come    at the time they haven t yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet    the two of course go hand in hand    for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs    mickey during his marriage to mallory     as creator of my universe   i pronounce us man and wife      the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting   but telling   too    it reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones    this is what mickey means by   creator of my universe     he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes    it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears    scagnetti s first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant s mouth    the indian sage releasing mallory s father   who was reincarnated as a snake     old man   go be a snake     after telling his   snake story   that ends with   bitch   you knew i was a snake      after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare   mallory says     you killed life ! ! !    this is another telling quote because it implies they didn t see themselves as killers of life    then what were they killing up to that time    in some case just those zombies faking their way through life   the living dead   as it were    in other cases   all the anti life forces   the cops and their parents    the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison    it of course symbolizes rebirth    dr   emil reingold   as portrayed by steven wright   passing judgement on m&m     mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong   they just don t give a damn      this is reminiscent of nietzsche s whole philosophy   and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil    mickey     the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers      mickey   again in his interview       me and you   we are not the same species      notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control    mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang    the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader   no matter who it is    mickey   how ya feelin     wayne   fucking great !  mickey   you got the feelin     wayne   i m alive    i m alive for the first fuckin  time !  what an incredible transformation this is    he got the feeling and he couldn t contain himself    what a feeling    that feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe    mickey when almost caught in a dead end     think   think   think   think      go figure it out    dwight   tommy lee jones   in general   because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film    his whole attitude can be summed up with     destroy them ! ! !    
Neg, pre review note   seeing as the only concern of body shots is   sex     i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review    because of this   i will try to vary word descriptions of   sex     meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms   and \ or your name is jerry falwell   you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen     so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend   fret not   it s most likely just another way of referring to   sex      i think we d all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review    though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what    body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously   in the way you d normally expect to see a violent attack    it s about people who think about screwing   seek it out   and talk about it    these are things we all do   sometimes    the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts    their lives center around the next sexual encounter   but they seemed depressed    it s as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek    at its core body shots is a message movie   the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition    michael cristoffer   who directed gia   another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil   is a moralist with nothing new to say    his characters don t communicate anything of interest to each other   so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera    they voice simplistic platitudes like   i like to come   or   sex without love equals violence      huh    and yes that is as complex as this movie s observations get    the characters are stupid and shallow   with not one registering as anything more    the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure   then the after math   the morning after   of such events    we meet the characters as they speak directly to us   confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy    i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them   giving you the pros and cons   but for this film i cannot    i m not trying to be clever or witty   but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others    with the exception of trent   played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman     the rest fade into each other   a patchwork of fake breasts   defined abs   pearly white teeth   and creamy   flawless skin    i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one   only because his character gets the worst lines     sex without love equals violence        in between all the confessionals   cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial   with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning    the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me    this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining    if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k obsessed   fine   i don t have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way   but cristoffer only gives us one side    additionally that one side isn t even entertaining   the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness    or realism    one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters    they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason   other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other       alas   if it could only be that easy       kidding of course     then   not only isn t it erotic   it isn t real    it doesn t feel like an authentic sexual encounter    every f * * k scene in this film   and there are many   is treated in the same unsexy manner    body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film    it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it   and most of all   it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it    the resulting search for nookie   and you can take that cookie         over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow    the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred    the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape   one where it is consensual the other where it is not   and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off    this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently   and if memory serves me i can t think of one film that has done so   and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80 s next to wall street    unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care   not the writer   the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off    paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here   though boogie nights succeeded    it was similarly moralistic   but it gave us two different viewpoints   it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters   and it showed us the possible fall out of such a decision    the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here   but anderson seemed to care about them    he gave them heart    cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones    he preaches to us   by using his characters to preach to us    this is not the way to get any message across    why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin  skins    cristofer kind of does that   though without an ounce of insight   and with a helping of leering exploitation    
Pos, sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film    sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride    i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers   most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes    surprised   they may have been   when they realized that this picture actually had something to say    but by the attentiveness of the crowd i d say they were won over   as was i   i can t tell yet if truman really is that good   or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year    time alone will make that call    but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank s side    we were concerned for his well being   and wanted him to win    that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey   who has achieved legitimacy at last    the truman show is a film best viewed cold   with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot    unless you re under a media blackout   however   you probably know the basics    carrey stars as truman burbank   a capra esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl   laura linney   in the south florida island town of seahaven   which looks like michael eisner s idea of the perfect american small town    truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle   complete with a working wife   a best bud   friendly neighbors and interesting co workers    there is tragedy in his past   his father drowned in a horrible boating accident   leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water   and of travel in general   but overall   life is good    but then one day as truman leaves his house for work   a klieg light falls magically from the sky    this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows   that he is a prisoner on the world s biggest soundstage   that his wife   friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him   and that his life has   for over 10   000 days   been broadcast as the world s most popular television program    what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir    the soundstage   we re told   is   only the second man made structure visible from space      truman s movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5   000 cameras scattered throughout the town   button cams   dashboard cams   mirror cams   wife cams   big cams and small cams    weir cuts the film so we re never quite sure if we re watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show s omnipotent creator christof   ed harris   who oversees the show from a control room built into the man made moon in seahaven s sky    the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence    his best friend marlon   noah emmerich   always has a six pack of beer with him    his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product    he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town    one wonders why he didn t pick up on any of this earlier   but christof has an answer for this     people tend to accept the reality with which they re presented      nevertheless   truman begins to grow restless   and dreams of escape to fiji   where an old college sweetheart   natasha mcelhone   supposedly lives    this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept   the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way    by underplaying truman   he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over    there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon   and marlon answers with best friend sincerity     i d gladly step in front of a bus for you      but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof    the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home   and from that moment   we re on his side    the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies   haven t we all   at least once   doubted our place in the world   doubted the sincerity of those closest to us    ultimately   however   the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator    what does god really think of us    does he resent our abandonment of paradise    who exactly is watching us   up there in the sky    if you enjoy the picture as much as i did   credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work    as for carrey   well   truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play    carrey is no jimmy stewart   to his credit   he doesn t try to be    he just tries to feel the way you or i would   if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us    
Neg, stars   armand assante   mike hammer     barbara carrera   dr    charlotte bennett     laurene landon   velda     alan king   charles kalecki     geoffrey lewis   joe butler     paul sorvino   detective pat chambers     judson scott   charles hendricks     barry snider   romero     julia barr   norma childs   / mpaa rating   r / review    in the 1982 updating of mickey spillane s 1947 novel   i   the jury     hard boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am   dresses like don johnson in   miami vice   with less pastels   and has sworn off alcohol    however   he still smokes his lucky strikes   detests all forms of authority   and kills at a whim    beyond that   the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page turner by spillane   probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers    the movie starts off with a bang   a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series   complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti     rocky        after that   the movie and the book begin the same   with the murder of jack williams   frederick downs     a one armed detective and hammer s best friend    hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack s death   and with the help of his devoted secretary   the blond and shapely velda   laurene landon     and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers   paul sorvino     he is immediately on the killer s trail    here the movie splits completely from the book   and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia   the cia   one of hammer s vietnam vet buddies   and a kinky sex clinic    many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie   but they take on slightly different roles    for instance   charles kalecki   alan king     a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book   turns into a suave mob boss    and   more importantly   hammer s suspicious love interest   charlotte bennett   barbara carrera     morphs from a run of the mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic       i   the jury   is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane s books   including a 1953 version which was made in 3 d     but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way   it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood s production code    although this takes the 1982 version of   i   the jury   closer to the core of the original subject matter   it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism   because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book    rest assured   the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity   but it is thoroughly violent   especially toward women    it features one woman having her neck slashed   a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia   judson scott     and another woman shot point blank in the belly by hammer himself    no one would deny that spillane s writing has a definite misogynistic nature   but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment   its constant equation of sex and violence   much of which is played with the intention of being erotic   is quite unsettling    it s no surprise that the movie   like the book   fades to black with a dead woman on the floor       i   the jury   had a troubled production and was not well supported by the studio that made it   which is one explanation why it didn t do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made    the script was written by larry cohen   who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies   like   it s alive     1974   and its two sequels     q     1981     and   the stuff     1985      cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well   but he was yanked from the director s chair after only a week s worth of shooting because he was already $100   000 over budget    he was quickly replaced by richard t   heffron   who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects    heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent   but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently    it shows in the final product    cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer   but heffron has none    he shot the movie quickly and clumsily   and although some scenes ring true   most of them are flat   trite   and invariably dull    the movie features numerous car chases   shoot outs   and stunts   but heffron s background in television is the dominant tone   despite the graphic violence and full frontal nudity     i   the jury     takes on the air of a made for tv quickie   with no real punch or depth    but the problems in   i   the jury   run deeper than the technical    the central fault in this updating is mike hammer   whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties    because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person   hammer s character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona    we never really get that impression in the movie    there is no first person voice over narration and some scenes don t have hammer in them at all    consequently   a great deal of the texture of spillane s storytelling is lost    the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer s moral code is thrown to the wind    despite his characterization as a hard nosed   violent   misogynistic killer   hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code    the title itself     i   the jury     refers to his anti establishment notion of being his own law    unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police   hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment    in this way   he can be seen as   above the law     but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct   his own morality    the movie forgoes that aspect of his character   and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society s terms   but in any terms   especially his own    if anything   hammer always had his professionalism   but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful    maybe the scene was intended for laughs   but it only cheapens hammer s character and is   by all accounts   a lousy way to start the movie    the blame for hammer s character can t be laid on assante s shoulders   because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon like mumbling   he delivers a fine performance    spillane never once described hammer s physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared   so any actor could conceivably portray him    of course   because of the lack of written description   those who have read spillane s books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like   and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations   spillane   who played the character himself in 1963 s   the girl hunters     is generally considered the best of the film hammers      the rest of actors are most un noteworthy    with the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino   everyone who appeared in   i   the jury   were up and comers who basically went nowhere    many of them ended up working in television   like carrera   who had a short stint on   dallas   in the mid eighties     which only adds to the made for tv atmosphere of the

Neg, susan granger s review of   glitter     20th century fox    there s less here than meets the eye    or   put it this way   if you thought madonna was awful in   shanghai surprise     mariah carey s worse in this reworking of   a star is born      she plays billie frank who   despite being abandoned by her singer/alcoholic mother   valerie pettiford     believes she s destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is       you ve got this amazing gift   and you gotta use it     her roommate says       your voice   it s incredible     says another singer       i ain t never met anyone like you     proclaims julian   dice   black   max beesley     the hot new york dj who becomes her svengali like producer/lover    problem is   her signature song     i didn t mean to turn you on   is wretched    and when she fumes out of filming her first music video because the director wants to   exploit   her by having her wear a bikini   the audience bursts into laughter    exploit mariah carey   who chooses to wear as little as the law will allow    come on !  writer kate lanier s script is fatuous and director vondie curtis hall doesn t have a clue how to handle the glitzy pop diva and   as a result of their incompetence   whispery voice d ms   carey seems to be embarrassed on screen    she almost cringes when the camera comes in for a close up   pursing her lips and averting her glassy eyes    talented british musician max beesley appears equally inept   and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans around the manhattan skyline   there s an audible audience groan when the twin towers of the world trade center come into view    perhaps one of the reasons ms   carey suffered her highly publicized nervous breakdown this summer is because she saw a preview of this clunker    on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10     glitter   is a pathetic 1    right now   it s tops on my list of the worst of 2001    
Pos, the calendar year has not even reached its midway point   but that hasn t prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar bait season    bille august s high profile adaptation of victor hugo s classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic  handsome production values   strong performances by a top notch cast   a literate screenplay  with one critically missing element   emotional sweep    for those not familiar with hugo s original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired   the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th century french set version of the fugitive    after serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread   the brutish jean valjean   liam neeson   is paroled    immediately upon release   he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night   he is caught by authorities   only to be forgiven by the bishop   who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow    that he does   and in doing so breaks his parole   which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert   geoffrey rush     who was one of the guards in valjean s prison camp   on his trail    thematically   however   les miserables is a story about redemption   which valjean finds through his dealings with two women   the hard luck factory worker turned prostitute fantine   uma thurman     and her illegitimate daughter   cosette    years after breaking parole   valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau   where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert    valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette   mimi newman   from her cruel caretakers   the thenardiers   and raise the child as his own    the   father   and   daughter   eventually land in paris   where the teenage cosette   claire danes   falls for dashing student revolutionary marius   hans matheson      the decades spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of   and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english language work   following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year s stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla s sense of snow    he and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace    production designer anna asp   costume designer gabriella pescucci   and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast    neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable   rush s finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated   oscar winning theatrics in shine   and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role    the younger members of the cast fare less well    danes is convincing as cosette   but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction   and matheson   while competent   is a less interesting robert sean leonard    as technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is   by the time les miserables was over   my emotions had only been superficially involved    while i was touched by valjean s relationships with fantine and cosette   i was not moved    not even reaching the   touching   level is the cosette marius pairing    my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical   as i am sure many others  is     and i was dismayed to see eponine   a friend of marius s who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him   almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation   the daughter of the thenardiers   here she is only briefly seen as a child      her presence would have added some much needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance   but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine   fantine   was enough    even so   as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season   les miserables is a thoughtful   well made   entertaining film   one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn no brainers invade the multiplex    
Neg, the most interesting part of   can t hardly wait   just happens to be not only the most human   but for many of us   the one part that many of us can easily relate to    that is the character of denise   lauren ambrose     the film s sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film   and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored    the film wisely holds over this moment   nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party       almost  too nicely    for some members of the audience   read   me     this is basically a mirror of what s going on with them watching this film    we sit there wondering why we ve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place    i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this    after all   this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with    everyone s here   the jock   the homecoming queen   the nerd   and his dominions of trekkies and x philes     the alienated wannabe writer   the school spirit girl   the pothead   s     the wigger   etc   etc   etc   and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial   lame   and basically as a bunch of losers    except for denise   who rolls her eyes at everything   and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks   her yearbook entry   something which is done for each main character   quotes oscar wilde   definite pointers there      unfortunately   the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film    the film   as i said   portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything    however   instead of sticking with this   perhaps even going a bit further with it   they let this lie   and actually make these characters into our heroes    we follow several of them   all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism   and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and/or identified with them    and if we did   we certainly don t want to revisit that state of being    here s a quick low down   it s graduation   and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night   otherwise known as the   american grafitti   or   to a lesser extent   the   dazed and confused   cliche    the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly   the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party       can t hardly wait   just opts for a big indoor keg party   and a little bit of aimless driving   albeit of the i m whining because i can t get a girl i want brand    we follow many people around   but mostly we trail preston   ethan embry   of   that thing you do !       the alienated writer   who s been pining over the homcoming queen   amanda   the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt     for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart    now that she s broken up with her football player boyfriend   mike   peter facinelli     he decides to go to the party with a note he s written declaring his   love   for her in the hopes he ll build up the guts to give it to her       even  though he s leaving for a multi week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut   okay   the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson        since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film   and because it s a party   there are some more main characters   such as   william   charlie korsmo   finally surfacing after   dick tracy       the nerd   and his dominions   who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike   who s humiliated him for years   but gets too caught up in drinking to do it   kenny   seth green     the wigger   who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid   uh huh     and denise   the only exceptional character   who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom   don t ask   with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile    ugh    the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not   american grafitti   or   dazed and confused     two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers   not to mention were extremely entertaining     but to john hughes films of the 80s   most notably   sixteen candles      the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters   and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion    this film forgets to satirize its characters   and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes       and  then says that it s all okay    we can t take this film seriously   nor can we take this as fun   so really what good is it    but i will tell you some things i did like   i liked the direction   except for a couple too over the top features   like way too glossy jump cuts   it s like an oxymoron   and other obscurities    generally   though   elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement   and even manage to capture an altman esque feel to their film from time to time   a thing with a note   though   is too hokey to really be admirable      i actually did like seth green   for once in about a decade   when he played a very young woody allen in   radio days       his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable       almost    and   of course   lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise   the one character we could have used some more of   even though it would have changed the entirety of the film    however   the character of denise really doesn t work with the film   when really thought about    she s far too witty and realized   at least for the first half   to belong in this film   and whenever she appears   she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone    she s not just the cynic or the intellectual   she s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters    she may ruin the film more   but at least when she s on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves   well   at least we ll be entertained      a couple other things that just don t work   mike s character   who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything   too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general   the aimless   bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda   give me a break   and perhaps the one thing that just doesn t work at all   jenna eflman s uncredited cameo as an angel   just didn t work   but nice try    basically the worst thing about this film   the real reason i m giving this such a low rating   is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we d do    we don t feel for these characters because for most of us   we aren t stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots    the acid test for high school movies is   does it at all capture the feel of what it s portraying    the answer for this film is no    nice try   though    
Neg, the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars    producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars   sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze    gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry    cage is legendary retired car thief   memphis raines   don t you love cute movie names     who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thick headed brother   ribisi   from being killed    seems a murderous crime boss   eccleston   with a fetish for wood   insert your own joke   hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive   exotic autos    fifty cars   to be exact    poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly    if the cars aren t delivered in three days   bossman has a casket carved out just for kip    literally    if only someone could save him    hmmmm     wonder  what memphis is doing    in order to give the film some emotional heft   there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of       yawn   excuse me   dramatic tension    shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe   lindo   who s looking to send memphis away    will he catch him    there s old flame sway   jolie     who had her heart broken by memphis years ago    will they get back together    shortsighted   thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother   yet resents him for moving away from the family    will they reconnect    raines old mentor   duvall   has long since left the life of crime    will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life   one more time    can you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first    i ll bet you can    following the opening credits   which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through a montage of old photos   we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis    he s first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go carts    in a later scene   as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control   all the while making breakfast   a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions    just as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it   big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it    looks like everything might turn out alright after all    you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins    that s about as strong as the characterization gets   which is a shame    bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand    monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis    or maybe it s just the cars    duvall trots out his ornery   but sweet old codger outfit    i m sure he s still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one    lindo projects a warm hearted   but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material    the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones   who plays a mute accomplice of memphis    without saying a word   he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie    like a blast of nitrous oxide   he attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal    too bad his minutes onscreen are so few    somehow   bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept   poorly written movies   gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes    every time something clever happens it s counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you re watching a movie    there s a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot    it s counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a driver s test    imagine the yuks    there s a segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick    it s countered by the lame semi subplot of a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk    the ramifications are never explored    then there s the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars    not only is it stupid   but it s against the law    this is a movie made of pretty   but tepid car chases strung together by just enough character interaction to move the plot along    gone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long it ll take for this marginally entertaining   but empty film to leave your memory    
Neg, there are scenes in   the big hit   that are so awful   they simply defy description    the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made   last action hero     1993   such a chore to sit through    presumably     the big hit   is an action comedy   a difficult but not impossible genre to pull off    movies of this sort require a fine balance and careful tone   and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence       lethal weapon 2     1989   is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very   very funny    unfortunately   in   the big hit     it seems that comedy is the main motive   and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs    unfortunately   there are no laughs    the movie resembles some of the goofy   throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films   but it doesn t benefit from chan s incredible stunts and goofy   charismatic presence    instead   we are left with a lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg   who must have considered himself invincible after his critically acclaimed performance in last year s   boogie nights      however   if he wants to maintain a decent career   he had better start selecting his projects more carefully   movies like this are a sure fire recipe for a long career in the straight to video market    wahlberg plays melvin smiley   an amiable guy who also happens to be a professional hitman   see   grosse pointe blank   for the same character   much better developed      the movie wants us to think     gee how clever and ironic   a guy who can kill without any moral implications   and yet he can t stand for anyone not to like him      the fact is   melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him   that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee   christina applegate   with a horrendous new york accent   and an abusive girlfriend   lela rochon   who is only using him for his money    his constant bending over backwards to please people makes him a complete patsy at best   and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst    melvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named paris   avery brooks   as part of a team of hitmen   which also includes cisco   lou diamond phillips   and crunch   bokeem woodbine      one day   melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi   sab shimono   for a million dollar ransom    however   not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing a big hollywood movie   inside joke   get it       but his kidnapped daughter   keiko   china chow     also happens to be paris  goddaughter    so   when paris finds out she s been kidnapped   he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it    not knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme   paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper    of course cisco blames the whole thing on poor   innocent melvin    along the way   there are several obligatory gunfights   explosions   and car chases   plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by   jurassic park     and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko   who looks like she s barely pushing fifteen      what the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers   hara kiri   drinking problems   leaking body bags   and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation   and now spends all his time doing hand exercises    not to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of   king kong lives     which is two weeks overdue    this mess of a movie was helmed by che kirk wong   the latest hong kong director imported by john woo     face/off       who also served as executive producer    woo needs to stop acting as a conduit for other directors   and start making more of his own films    wong   who directed such films as   rock n roll cop   back in hong kong   is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy    maybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean   but they re not here   at least in the manner wong handles them    many of the problems can be traced back to the script   which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey    in addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences   ramsey s script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar   poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet style dialogue    what he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather   most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips   whose favorite phrase is   it s all love     and robin dunne   who plays cisco s stuttering   black wannabe assistant    the irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale   which can pretty much describe the film as a whole    
Neg, this movie stinks !  although it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances   the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss    i knew i was in for trouble when   during the opening establishment shots   we see a detailed close up of warrant officer paul brenner s   john travolta   military identification card and it is the wrong color    this might seem like a minor detail   but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow    and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training    or what about when brenner tells a suspect that   because he is in the military   he doesn t have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision    how hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts    now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up   but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through    for example   at the beginning of the film   paul brenner   an undercover army investigator   gets into a gun and knife battle at his off post houseboat and winds up killing an arms dealer he had been investigating    the local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing    but instead of arresting him   or at least take him into custody for further questioning   they release him    duh !  ultimately   brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding general s daughter   a young captain also assigned to the post    when brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general s daughter   does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects    no   his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing    eventually   brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier    i won t even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army s suppression of this horrendous crime    i will just mention one final flaw    brenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia    the rape occurred in west point   which is in new york    he is under a very tight   and totally implausible   36 hour deadline to solve this case    he needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point    does he phone the doctor    no   he travels   via some unexplained very fast transport   to new york to question the psychiatrist in person   and then he returns to georgia   again by the miracle transport     without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline    you have been warned   stay away from this one

say about jackie chan that hasn t already been said    since the release of  rumble in the bronx   back in 1996   the u   s   release     jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on america s video shelves    having made over 80 films   jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action comedy to the west    his latest release     shanghai noon     is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western    and by adding jackie chan into the genre   the tag line for the film     the western gets a kick in the pants     rings true    jackie stars as chon wang   a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china    the royal princess pei pei   lucy liu   is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture    unwilling to follow her father s wishes   princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor   decides to escape to america    but this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong   which will lead to the princess  kidnapping and ransom    unable to take any legal action   the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city s bravest guards   played by cui ya hi   rong guang yu   and eric chen   are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city   nevada    chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team   as he is looked upon as a buffoon    on a train in the u   s   jackie meets up with bandit roy o bannon   owen wilson      he is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog   looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit

behaves like a dog and an indian bride   brandon merrill     before once again running into roy       shanghai noon   is just good fun    the chemistry between the cast is remarkable    the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film    jackie s performance is as good as anything he s done before    he s not called on to do much acting here   as the character is not written with any depth    but jackie s natural charisma shines through   and his comic timing is so perfect   both physically and   surprise   verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on    owen wilson   last seen in the embarrassing remake of   the haunting     gives a good natured performance as roy o bannon    his innocence is refreshing and fun    a bad guy that s not really bad    his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis    lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script   but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant    the character is a noble woman of status and wealth   but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment    the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances    nothing here is realistic   mind you       shanghai noon   is first and foremost a light   jovial film    and the performances match that style with ease    the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous    using calgary   alberta as the prime location    mr   mindel is able to create a lush   romantic western feel to the film    nothing here really looks like nevada   but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged   the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre    and as such   the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history   but with reverence to past films    homage to such films as   high noon     obviously       red river   and most notably   butch cassidy & the sundance kid   all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film    it is a comforting experience    at a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant   here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and   dare i say   clich   s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing    here is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre    this is the purest   horse opera   since the days of george o brian or john wayne    director tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood s past    in this   his first film mr   dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see    nothing here really stands out   or takes one s attention away from the story or action    and that is as it should be   when jackie chan is your star    and what of the action and stunts    well   while not up to a level of   drunken master 2   or any of jackie s hong kong films     shanghai noon   is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before    his timing   choreography   and creativity are still as sharp as ever    jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films   obvious to those of us that have seen those films   but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar      finally jackie can honestly say   that he has made an u   s     his way and incorporating his style    to sum up     shanghai noon   is a fun summer confection    not too heavy and not too light    a fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy   parents be advised there are scenes of smoking   drunkenness and peyote use      an enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again    
Pos, trees lounge is the directoral debut from one of my favorite actors   steve buscemi    he gave memorable performences in in the soup   fargo   and reservoir dogs    now he tries his hand at writing   directing and acting all in the same flick    the movie starts out awfully slow with tommy   buscemi   hanging around a local bar the   trees lounge   and him pestering his brother    it s obvious he a loser    but as he says   it s better i m a loser and know i am   then being a loser and not thinking i am      well put    the story starts to take off when his uncle dies   and tommy   not having a job   decides to drive an ice cream truck    well   the movie starts to pick up with him finding a love interest in a 17 year old girl named debbie   chloe sevigny   and        i liked this movie alot even though it did not reach my expectation    after you ve seen him in fargo and reservoir dogs   you know he is capable of a better performence    i think his brother   michael   did an excellent job for his debut performence    mr   buscemi is off to a good career as a director !  
Pos, with more and more television shows having gay characters   and even the infamous   ellen   sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian   the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines    the birdcage was critically acclaimed   as was this years chasing amy    then along came in & out   and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released    it s also noticeable that this   alternative lifestyle   becomes less and less taboo as the years go by   and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort    while it s a very serious issue to many   it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety    but the way we re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically    while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at *   it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with *   and when a movie like in & out comes along   it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy    it doesn t poke fun at the lifestyle   it simply uses it to all it s comedic capacity   just as love   sex   marriage   birth   death   and anything else has been    the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids afflicted gay man in philadelphia    if you remember   during his acceptance speech   hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community   and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life    it s a serious and touchy subject   but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy   and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick    it s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual   it may have been more controversial   but because it was written by an openly gay writer   the prerogative was set    kevin kline   who only seems to become more and more acclaimed   stars as howard brackett   a high school english teacher in the small   picturesque town of greenleaf   indiana    after a three year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery   joan cusack     a wedding date has been set   and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story   greenleaf high graduate cameron drake   matt dillon   is up for a best actor oscar    the small town eagerly awaits both events   and both seem quite astronomical   but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other    when cameron drake is announced the winner   the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher   mr   brackett    everyone is cheering back in greenleaf   that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words     and he s gay      the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop    the thing is   nobody   including howard   can understand how cameron came to that conclusion   and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf    naturally the questions pour from howard s fiancee   parents   debbie reynolds & wilford brimley     students   and the high school s principal   tom halliwell   bob newhart     and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious   howard is clean   neat   honest   sincere   a romantic   and perhaps the most incriminating fact   he loves barbara streisand    the frenzy isn t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and   entertainment tonight   wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning    one particular reporter is peter malloy   tom selleck   of   inside entertainment     who unlike the collage of other reporters   wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett   including coverage of his wedding    the intrusion is all but welcome by howard   who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute    it seems that no matter where he turns   a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees    the dominoes begin to tumble as howard s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay    it all sounds very devastating   and it would be if it weren t presented with near perfection by one of this year s most delightful ensemble casts    kline seems only to improve with age   and he is downright perfect here    the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine   and they use it wonderfully    every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever    dillon has never been so likeable   cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role   and brimley   reynolds   and newhart all provide huge laughs when they re up to bat    rudnick s script is heavily laced with wit and humor   and you ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes    while in & out doesn t carry enough to give it four stars   it remains one of the best done films of the year   all around    the script is exuberant   the actors are absolutely top  notch   and we re allowed just the perfect blend of heart tugging so as not to bog down the laughs    it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety   yet we re still allowed a sappily touching ending    despite it s subject matter   and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex   this is a movie that everyone could   and should   enjoy    frank oz   best known as a voice talent for muppets   directs this film quite delightfully   using all the potential rudnick s script has to offer   which turns out to be quite a bit    check this one out    you ll have a gay old time    
Pos, with the success of the surprise hit alien   directed by ridley scott   a sequel was inevitable    in fact   after watching the first film   a sequel was wanted   particularly by this reviewer    handing over the director s chair to recent box office gem james cameron   who had only made two films previous to this one   pirahna ii   a surprisingly dull film   and terminator   making cameron a household name     the alien series got a face lift of immense proportions    instead of being a suspense/science fiction film   cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture    what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created    a film like aliens comes along only once in a while   and when it does   audiences are usually unprepared for it    i never saw this movie in theaters   but i wish i could have    the terror and fright must have been unimaginable   most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear    aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen    with a science fiction plot   cameron gives aliens added testosterone   pumping up the action and fire power from the original film    in fact   aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original    perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero  or heroine   as the case may be    never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film   and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character    sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about    placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual   but because of weaver s presence   a woman is the only suitable hero    aliens begins 57 years after alien ended    lieutenant ellen ripley   weaver   is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened    she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens   but   the company   is doubtful    they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left    despite stern warnings from ripley   the company remains rigid and won t call the families back    however   when the company loses contact with the colony   ripley s story seems much more feasible    one of the company s directors   carter burke   paul reiser     wants to gather a team to travel to the planet    this team includes a buff private vasquez   jenette goldstein     a questionable corporal hicks   michael biehn     and a loyal android bishop   lance henriksen      burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony    arriving on the planet   the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon type environment    the only survivor is 12 year old rebecca   newt   jorden   carrie henn      ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become   and she becomes newt s surrogate mother    ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened   and soon   all hell breaks loose    aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott s version   it also multiplies the number of aliens in general    alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member   except ripley   who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo    aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens   and as a result   the chills are incredibly heightened    then again   this is james cameron   the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2   judgment day    he is the best action director out there   topping renny harlin   who directed cliffhanger     and only he could create something as terrifying as this film    it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes   and aliens has the motherload    with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film   aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion    i can t recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout   never dropping for a moment    just when you think the movie is over   something else will occur   and it starts right back up again    with a seemingly endless conclusion   aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history    this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film   as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen    using flawless special effects   the climax is exhausting   leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety    of course   for a film of this genre to work properly   the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see    aliens is completely realistic   even a decade after its initial release    the special effects are wonderfully seamless   with a terrifying alien to go with them    one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music   composed by cameron regular james horner    horner has created a terrific score   receiving an oscar nomination for his work    not only that   horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film   or science fiction film ever   and that includes 2001   a space odyssey   which was mainly a compilation of well known composers      in fact   the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music    the production design is incredible   which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy    dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive   but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well lit locations    normally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer   aliens uses lights to scare the viewer    then   of course   is the cinematography   which uses point of view shots   along with video feeds in order to build suspense    some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley    surprisingly   the acting is not only above average for this genre   but some of the best    sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley   incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard edged persona    weaver soars above the rest in this film   but she is supposed to    carrie henn gives an above average performance for a child   developing a three dimensional character from her quiet attitude    lance henriksen is terrific as bishop   showing that androids don t always have to be flat characters    jenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role   and steals several scenes of her own   though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn t fighting      michael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film    however   biehn does a good job   making it seem original again    paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director   but reiser manages to pull it off quite well   however   i still see him as paul on tv s   mad about you        a very good cast   which also includes bill paxton and william hope   highlights this action film   making it stand out from others    aliens is rightfully rated r for violence   gore   language   and terror    aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre   as alien was more of a suspense/horror film    aliens pumps up the stakes   and cameron directs it with professional quality    cameron certainly knows how to make a good action film   but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen    technically astonishing   aliens  only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed    aside from this   you probably won t experience anything like aliens for quite a while    
Neg, writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard    harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun    harder than building a bridge over troubled waters    and incidentally   a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review    thrillers are all variations on a theme    you have a smart   resourceful   and powerful bad guy   who has a goal he has to meet    you have a noble and brave good guy   who has to protect the innocent   kill the bad guy   and not get killed himself in the process    the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner    this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest   high noon   or silence of the lambs   or big summer blockbusters like men in black   the fugitive   or air force one   or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds   event horizon   kull the conqueror          is anyone else getting depressed here    point is   it s not enough to follow the formula    you ve got to throw in something extra   something good and new and better than the last version    something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals    this is a hard thing to do   but it is absolutely necessary in every way    without that something extra    whether it s a great plot or a well written screenplay   or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs    the movie fails    that s why the jackal   with all its starpower   with all its budget   with all its hype   gets a big fat f    bruce willis is the bad guy   the jackal   a legendary killer for hire    richard gere is the good guy   a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal    the jackal is trying to kill someone    gere is trying to stop him    will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal       i ll give you three guesses   and the first two don t count      there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal   no moment when you say to yourself     i wonder what happens next      the script for the jackal isn t ripped straight from today s headlines    it s ripped off   straight from an episode of millennium    throughout the movie   we learn what the jackal s plans are and how he intends to accomplish them    no surprise    the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal s plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy    instead   we get two   count  em   two   scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal s plan just as if he s frank black   or more likely   just as if he s been handed a copy of the script      and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight    it s like gere s character is psychic   but neither he nor the fbi   or the screenwriters   seem to know it    and just like in millennium   the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about   whether or not they are important to what he s trying to do or not    what s more   in the last half of the movie   the jackal   supposedly a super smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake   comes down with a major case of the stupids    as for the performances        bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack   which is a major achievement   but not enough reason to see the movie    his disguises are good   but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer s in the saint    richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent   which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance    sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie    not that his performance is bad or anything   it s not   but it is sad that hollywood won t use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent   shoot to kill   sneakers      writing a good plot and a good screenplay   like i said   is hard   but it can be done    it wasn t done here    it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones    do not go see this movie    you ll only encourage the producers to make more just like it    instead   stay home and rent day of the jackal   or in the line of fire   or a fire safety video   for crying out loud    anything other than the jackal   which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other   better movies    
Neg, you would think that this film s dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy and   americanizing   it    you d be wrong   since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series   rowan atkinson   robin driscoll   and richard curtis    should you ever happen to meet those chaps   do me a favor    grab them by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear     what were you thinking   !  have you ever heard the phrase  if it ain t broke don t fix it    !    then walk away    the film concerns mr   bean   atkinson   and his visit to america while escorting the painting of   whistler s mother   to an american buyer   played by burt reynolds   in the type of bit part that his success in   boogie nights   should hopefully do away with      now how or why mr   bean is sent on this trip makes no sense   and i can t even describe how the film explains it    the point is that mr   bean comes to america and causes wacky trouble    problems problems problems   where to begin    first   the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one note away from the score from   beetlejuice   or one note away from the score from   rob roy      then   the song choices are totally uninspired       good vibrations         i love l   a        wow   don t put any thought into that guys    also   bean makes way too much noise in the film    the character doesn t speak much   but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience   and maybe the occasional murmur from mr   bean    each episode was like a chaplin silent movie    in the film   bean is constantly moaning   grunting   whining   etc   it s annoying   and just plain wrong for the character    the main problem though is that it s just not funny    with each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes    multiply that running time by three however   and the laughs steadily decrease    they even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series    sad   and creatively lazy    as a series     mr   bean   only ran for about 13 episodes or so    why on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything    13 half hour episodes certainly hadn t exhausted all possible situations    all i can say positively for the film at this point is that it s almost appropriate for all ages   if it wasn t for a couple of scenes where it appears as though mr   bean is having sex with things    and even that isn t a very positive statement    please guys   go back to england and go back to television so you ll make me laugh again    [pg 13]  
Neg, alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft played character of dashing swordsman d artagnon in director peter hyam s adventure   the musketeer      for some reason that i may figure out later   i don t know why the time   money and effort were put into the making of   the musketeer      it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film s xin xin xiong     once upon a time in china     and yuen woo ping from   crouching tiger   hidden dragon      the result is a mix of genres that don t mesh well    elements of the ritz brothers style comedy   for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939   the three musketeers       the man with no name from   a fistful of dollars     d artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western   and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano    the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the   matrix   crowd    alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters    the real problem with the   the musketeer   lies in the casting of the two lead   romantically intertwined characters   d artagnan and francesca   mena suvari      chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character   a la chris o donnell   but lacks any onscreen charisma    suvari has the doe eyed   pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen   but she   too   does not have the chemistry to command the screen    if   the musketeer   makes them any money   they should invest in acting lessons    stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one    the supporting cast is   on the surface   impressive    catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty   dignity and humor   especially when she plays off of d artagnan s mentor   planchet   jean pierre castaldi   who reminds of andre the giant in   the princess bride      stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu   but is given very little to help flesh out his character    tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal s chief henchman   febre    he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout    the rest of the players   particularly the three musketeers aramis   nick moran     lock   stock and two smoking barrels       porthos   steve spiers   and athos   jan gregor kremp     are background fodder whose role is to come to d artagnan s aid when needed    peter hyam s does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well    a stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps    photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions   d artagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them single handed   he fights a gang of febre s henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen   with the obligatory branches hanging over the road     he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy   febre   who murdered d artagnan s folks years before    it is all routine stuff    the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap   defying gravity   up walls and from horse to horse    it works in a sci fi film like   the matrix   or in a classical fantasy like   crouching tiger   hidden dragon   but just calls attention to itself in   the musketeer      at one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being used    it did not make me a believer and i am very disappointed    with a run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like 80 and i give it a d    
Neg, capsule   the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith s films gets their own movie    the gags are sporadically funny    it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti gay jokes    the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team    the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film    sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching    this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night       and it turns out he had very good reasons         low 0    4 to +4    a film needs a plot    it needs characters for empathy value    it needs a story and an emotional center    if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are    kevin smith has now made two satisfying films   clerks and chasing amy    with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp    peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled    but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith s fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it    his remaining two films   mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience    jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes   penis jokes   flatulence jokes   film pastiches   and in jokes    how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call    for me   the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny    there was not enough cleverness or variety    it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay    penis jokes work only so many times    showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags    they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford   the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post war films including dead of night   the lady vanishes   and passport to pimlico    jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners    as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts    in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads    jay and silent bob   played by jason mewes and kevin smith   are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks    this leaves them at loose ends    they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie    they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash    so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way    the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood  the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny    silent bob   being silent   can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his    this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have    jay has to be the comic    he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive    the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny    he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair    so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team    their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before  sometimes just minutes before    like dogma before it   but definitely not like chasing amy   this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie    certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving    they are excuses for gags   many of which still fall flat    it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content    the film does not offer much to an adult audience    i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the  4 to +4 scale    
Pos, i don t box with kid gloves    i don t play nice   i m not a nice guy   and i never   ever   go easy on a film    i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic    however   i do some favors   and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery    rigormortis   the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking   gets several of these points each time    i still   however   will not go easy on them    they recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy   which begins   quite wittily   with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film     and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it    in the famous lines of many martyrs   i have no regrets    well   i do have some regrets   but that is not the point in the previous sentence    the point of it was that down with america was a film that   from a critical standpoint   did not entirely disappoint me    sure   the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain   and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films   but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable    down with america concerns a government agent   needless murder   and a book containing everything from the unabomber s manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report    like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed   it displays an off kilter humor and intelligence   it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail    the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s    a dying movement from the day they started   these paranoid `thrillers  had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word   `roswell      in down with america   the line `roswell  is highly absent    with an about ten minute running time   down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich   that the conspiracy films fell into   makes jokes at them at the same time   and provides us with funny and memorable characters    again   i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn t care less about    the film   as previously stated   concerns a federal agent   peter roach     an obsessed librarian   meri stevens     a mystery man   joe kaczkowski     and two people obsessed with silence in the library   robb sherman   kevin flowers      the plot   a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in   a public library where it can be viewed by all    from there we go into a delightful parody    the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth   the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books    we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast    although the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no name    it ends up being the no name people who do a good job   delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out    for once   i don t have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online    i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l auto and les x files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself    it s almost as much fun as the film    
Neg, lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4   episode 1 is a boring   empty spectacle that features some nice special effects    after the familiar  a long time ago            opening   the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game    the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo   ruled by queen amidala   portman   jedi knights qui gon   neeson   and obi wan   mcgregor   are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade    however   this simple blockade is not all it seems   and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers   including facing the evil darth maul   ray park      they also meet the future darth vadar   anakin skywalker   jake lloyd    star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking   script   direction and characters    the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic    the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star   and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non existent    there s no underlying tension   and no urgent need to see what the outcome is    the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story   which doesn t help    there s no snap to make the film work   it moves at a plod    the script is boring   all the characters speak in morals   especially anakins mother    there s no group spirit evident here   and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders   it s evident that not much is going to happen    the two leads are hideously boring   static characters given little to do and too much time to do it    qui gon and obi wan hold no presence on film   and give little for the audience to root for    the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul   if he had been given more screen time    maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history   even if he does provide the only  straight  plot line in the film   all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy      anakin is annoying and unlikeable      instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended    it s probably not surprising that his hateful little boy   unfortunately blessed  ani  by everyone he knows   joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible    the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks   although in the end none is provided in the film by him    although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys   the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny    the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a  pod  racer   because i knew he wouldn t be able to talk for a while    queen amidala is a nothing in the film   she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must  serve her people     and go goo goo over anakin    again   her role will become more important in the later episodes   and is given little to do here    the actors don t help the movie much either    liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed   and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible    mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy   with little charm    the casting director must have chose him because he s scottish like alec guinness   there s little other explanation for it    natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script   but she delivers a spunky performance    and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice    there s very little talent evident with him   it s hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there    he s not even very  cute      the main claim of the film   the special effects   are okay    there s nothing impressive about them   yet they complement the story well    the cgi takes away much of the human element   however    the battle droids for example   the replacement for the stormtroopers   are characterless little computer graphics   lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers    episode 1 is just disappointing    it s got high production values   but little else    the music is meandering   except near the end    the plot gives us no one to root for   or even care for    the effects are nice   but dull    the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should    there s an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair   and many clich   s are catered for throughout the film    apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence   episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose   except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film    disappointing is barely the word    rating=  
Neg, movie concepts are often pitched to producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films of the past    so   undoubtedly one day someone said      evolution      it s  ghostbusters  plus  men in black  plus  tremors        and so it is    sum total none    the alienbusting begins when a meteor lands in glen canyon   arizona    community college science profs ira kane   david duchovny   and harry block   orlando jones   take some samples from the meteor and discover that one celled organisms from inside it are evolving rapidly   doing in hours what took millions of years for life on earth    just about the time i was wondering     hey   doesn t the government usually come in and take over the whole area in these movies     the government came in and took over the whole area    the leader of the pack   gen   woodman   ted levine     turns out to be an old nemesis of ira s   and ira and harry are blocked from doing further research    meanwhile   the organisms continue to grow until they are large enough to start attacking people    by this time   ira and harry have gained a friend in dr   allison reed   julianne moore   of the center for disease control    a country club poolboy   wayne green   seann william scott     has also attached himself to the merry band    but can they find the means to stop the aliens in time    director ivan reitman seems to be revisiting his biggest hit   1984 s   ghostbusters     but   evolution   falls miserably short    one reason is readily apparent       ghostbusters   had three really funny guys as its scientists   bill murray   dan aykroyd   and harold ramis     but   evolution   has one really funny guy   orlando jones   who can adlib and milk the comic potential of lines that prove useless in anyone else s hands    for good measure     ghostbusters   had the comic talents of rick moranis     evolution   offers seann william scott   who was much funnier in   american pie   and   road trip   than he is here    scott has one amusing scene where he sings   you are so beautiful to me   to a dragon like alien to draw it into a trap    other than that   scott seems unable to make much of the thin material the writers gave him    an actor in search of a forte   david duchovny looked for his gritty action hero side in   playing god   and his romantic side in   return to me      now he wants to find his wacky comedic talent   what we all find is that he doesn t have any    look for him to be back on tv in five years or so    another sad case is julianne moore   who needs to be more selective about the offers she accepts    she s a talented actress with an impressive list of credits and award nominations   so why is she trying to do slapstick comedy    her character has a tendency to trip over and bump into things   but the trait comes off as a pathetic plea for laughs    the sole saving grace of the film is jones    he s at the center of the movie s funniest scene    where an alien bug invades harry s body and has to be pulled out through his ass    jones is the only cast member who can take the comedic ball and run with it   but he can t carry the whole movie by himself    he found himself in a similar situation in   the replacements     where he was also the only comic talent in an ensemble cast    jones will eventually find the project that will make him a major comedy star   but this isn t it    
Neg, one of the 90s  most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave   it s the       from hell   movie !  starting in the early nineties   we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationships from hell !  there were boyfriends from hell   friendly neighborhood cops from hell   nannies from hell   and even secretaries from hell    but hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten in the rush   the mother in law from hell ! ! ! ! !  the mother in law in question is martha   played by jessica lange    she has been single handedly running the family horse farm   kilronan    her son   jackson   johnathon schaech   and his girlfriend   helen   gwyneth paltrow     live in new york   and have no intention to move back down south to the rural kilronan    but those intentions are about to change    you see   martha lives by manipulation    she has used it in years past to breed many championship horses    now   she believes she can use it to breed herself a grandson    though at first   helen finds martha charming   soon she is caught in the domineering martha s web of deception    it s hard to understand why nobody ever wises up to martha  schemes    as written   most of the characters in the film must be very slow witted    but then   the film even treats the audience like idiots    it tries to get away with things   like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a rather unlikely place   without even batting an eye    then again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isn t one that s likely to question details    jessica lange s martha is the only semi developed character in the film   and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can    a character that could have been simply awful is merely groan worthy    gwyneth paltrow doesn t have much to build upon   as helen s only character trait seems to be   daughter in law      still   she fares better than johnathon schaech   whose character is so nonexistent   he s inexplicably missing for much of the film    still   there have been much worse        from hell   films    even with its paper thin characters and ludicrous setups   hush manages to create a few thrills in a color by numbers fashion    you know what s coming   but occasionally the film will deliver a shock or two    the old formulas are around for a reason   but that doesn t mean they taste fresh    
Neg, play it to the bone   the newest addition to ron shelton s sports   themed repertoire fails in numerous ways    like most of shelton s other great films   bull durham   white men can t jump     this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots    shelton s films are not considered sports films   but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story    shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions    play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull   but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse    the film has no social message like its predecessors    the relationship between the friends   two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars   is very confusing for a number of reasons    the whole film   since it is primarily a   buddy picture     depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other    unfortunately   it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below    1   we never see how cesar   antonio banderas   and vince   woody harrelson   meet    the two are so different from each other   that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory    2   vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas    there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something    3   the third character on the trip   grace   lolita davidovich   stands in the way    she is in nearly every scene with them   making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other    4   there are two many interfering   irrelevant side stories    vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis   cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry   and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner    these boring tales only hurt the central plot    5   when it comes to time for the two men to fight   they don t even hesitate to pound each other    wasn t the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other    by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with   the film wants to be over    shelton   on the other hand   continues to tell his story    forty five painful minutes remain    the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies    however   the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile   kind of like the whole film    
Pos, seen february 15   1998 on home video   borrowed from chris wessell      when it comes to modern gangster movies   it s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word   routine      i ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea   no matter how many times it s been used before   can provide for a good story and   donnie brasco   clinches this idea    it s not unlike most of the great films of the genre   yet it never apes another s style as it has a good layer of authenticity   even if its core is a tad stale    the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it    we meet lefty   pacino     an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk    he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this    somehow he comes across donnie brasco   depp     a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn t afraid of lefty and his rep   and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him    it s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately   telling him all the tricks of the trade    i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit    however   we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone   an fbi agent working undercover   a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer    the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor   a brief history of the mob   definitions of their slang   and where their money comes from and who it goes to    the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements   however   the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original    most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works   probably from watching other gangster movies     and although this attitude comes across   the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable    thankfully the film doesn t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime   and instead opts for character development    much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie    pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would    he s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does   just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be    we learn of his accomplishments   which are quite impressive within their context   and when he complains about not being made top boss   it s easy to sympathize with him    newell constantly plays up this aspect   making it a major theme which works well in the long run    as donnie is constantly impressing and even one upping lefty   it s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful   the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob   or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed    most of the film tells the story of donnie s life in mafia   which creates for many sub plots and individual conflicts   but doesn t always seem to come together as a whole    the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout   even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar    the resonance to donnie s actual assignment varies   he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress   but it doesn t always seem to have much meaning    back home   his wife maggie   heche   is ready to divorce him because he s never a and the family is suffering    since this is based on a true story i wouldn t doubt this would happen   although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic    my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act   or at least any real sense of closure    a climax of sorts does occur   but there s little feeling of a payoff    we get a happy ending   which is good   but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful    aside from a few minor   general flaws     donnie brasco   manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development    it may be routine   but it s good   and that s respectful    
Neg, summer movies are   by nature   dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money    wild wild west   the latest will smith affair   follows much the same formula   except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies    will smith plays jim west   a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses    he is called by president grant   kline   to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing    west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon   kline again   and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind   named dr   loveless   branagh   with a zany moustache      before i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair   i ll give it a chance with the positives    there s a nice credit sequence   the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye   and the special effects are decent enough    there s also a pleasant soundtrack    buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes    and salma hayek pops up as the female interest   which is always nice to see    apart from these factors   though   nothing else in wild wild west works    firstly   there s little chemistry between smith and kline   who appears to be in it purely for the money    one would expect zingers passing between the two   none arise    both of them plod through the below standard plot   knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end    not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment   although he is over the top   the material doesn t present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy    therefore   he just comes across as loud as obnoxious    the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek   who is given so little screen time it s embarrassing    she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body   and be ogled at by kline and smith    her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script   and there is no sense of realism about the character    the  humour  in the film is also very off    will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black   here   not even smith could save the humour on display    the script largely boils down to insults that aren t very funny   and one liners that barely raise a smirk    it s also somewhat racist   although it doesn t intend to be   with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching   and actually says slavery is good to save himself    it s not a funny scene   and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably    the film also makes the tragic mistake that a man   in this case kline   in a dress is automatically unfunny   it isn t   but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness    there s also problems with the plot    jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations   but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying   and rely purely on luck   rather than audience pleasing skill    plot elements are introduced into the film   and then thrown away just as quickly    the main piece of the story   a 80 foot mechanical   steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive   but there s no particular reason why it should be built    why not loveless build a great big tank   instead of an ungainly   fragile piece of machinery that s just begging to be blown up    director barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them   with some nice camera tricks   but even this is missing from this stilted affair    wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing   but not much of it is evident   making this film drag out even more    it s a sad thing when  four    credited   screenwriters   a talented director and a willing star can t make a film work   and eventually wild wild west collapses under it s sexist   mildly racist   unfunny weight    
Pos, the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it s adequately explained by the commercials    with 11 days to go until the election   the president   who we never see   calls in political dirty tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal    deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a   pageant     a phony war against albania   fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville   with woody harrelson as the reluctant   psychotic hero    and if there wasn t anything more to the movie than this   it would be a second rate heist comedy at best   enlivened by great actors    like sneakers goes to washington       a heist comedy    yup    deniro and hoffman are   stealing   the election   so to speak   and the movie is more about how they do it    and the fun they have doing it    than anything else      wag the dog succeeds because it s based one great truth   the american people are stupid    ok   maybe it s not   love thy neighbor as thyself   or even   two plus two makes four     but a truth nonetheless       any average person who thinks that they re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes    moviemaking and the political process    is invited   nay   challenged   to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c span when the house is in session      and because we re so utterly   predictably stupid   hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo   washington knows that we won t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies    and deniro s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won t be able to locate albania on the map    the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn t a light   meaningless comedy about politics   like speechless   the michael keaton   geena davis picture   or from the level of light hearted politcal satire to near greatness    nor is it a hard edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally deprived   ethically challenged baby boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house   like primary colors    and yes   i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out   thanks for asking      instead   david mamet s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire    it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers  schemes come off beautifully   and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion    deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables   without any of the violent rages    it s all     what do i love    what is it that brings me joy    baseball     minus the savage bloody beating with the bat    he threatens a lot of people   mind you   but he s doing it in a very nice   polite way    it s a very mellow   restrained performance   which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script    hoffman   on the other hand   is giddy   exuberant and joyous    this kind of thing is what his character lives for   and he s so excited that he can t even shut up    even on the edge of disaster   he s bright eyed   behind oddly tinted sunglasses   and positive    insiders note that he s basing his character on some powerful but anonymous producer    which may or may not be true   but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets put on a show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have    the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast    the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them   listen to them talk in that wised up mamet dialogue   get to know them better    which we don t    anne heche   is dead bang on in her portrayal of a political press aide    cool and composed on the outside   panicked and frenzied on the outside    denis leary   one of my favorite actors    see the ref   is the   fad king     who handles the profitable   back end      t shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative   innovative ways to separate a fool from his money    they could make a whole movie   just about the fad king   and i d go see it    willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously   from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song   to the weepy country waltz   to the hilarious   ballad of the green berets   parody    woody harrelson has a brief   but memorable part as the overmedicated   hero   of the albanian conflict    craig t   nelson   as the opposition candidate   and the ever reliable william h   macy   as a wacky cia agent   are given surprisingly short shrift       one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing      wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems   the trivialization of american politics   the role of the press in dumbing down the issues   the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials   the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars    the list goes on    we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens    wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don t

Pos,        it s certainly more than just a monster story          kenneth branagh   director/actor/co writer of mary shelley s frankenstein    kenneth branagh s new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world   including the most controversial version of them all   directed by james whale    the dark and stormy nights   the lightning bolts   the charnel houses of spare body parts   the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful    but the center of the film   quieter and more thoughtful   contains the real story    horror fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror    branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues   morality   philosophy and human elements of the story   and not on old fashioned horror cliches    his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel    the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean    the year is 1794    a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters    his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs    as the ice closes around his ship   a figure appears on the horizon    it s a man    exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew    his name is victor frankenstein   kenneth branagh   and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown    the myserious stranger begins his tale   or more precisely his confession   in geneva   1773    he is remembering his childhood and youth    laughter   banquets and parties   a happy life   without troubles or concerns    here victor lived with his father   ian holm     mother   cherie lunghi     his surrogate sister   helena boham carter   and his servants in happiness and harmony    this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed    like thunder from a quite sky   his mother dies   giving birth to his youngest brother    shocked   baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair   victor   already interested in science   becomes obsessed with death    standing on his mother s grave he says     oh mother     you  did not have to die       no one should ever die       i  will stop this     i  promiss        after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished   victor travels to ingolstadt   in presuite of a medical career    after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night   creating life from death    composing dead bodies   frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man   both physically and mentally    with strong electrical impulses   he managed to breeth life into his creation    the result was ugliness    realizing what he has done   frankenstein tried to undo his work   but it was to late    the creature has escaped    because of the epidemic   frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home   making plans for the wedding    for a while everything is as it was before his mother s death    but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously        whale s picture   although powerful   never managed to capture the total depth of the novel    brannagh has more or less done that    another thing is characters and actors    branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast    the greatest performances comes from de niro   the monster   that has been played by   among others   charles ogle   karloff   lon chaney   bela lugosi   glenn strange   christopher lee   fred gwynne   as herman munster     and now   robert de niro    alone   hated and feared   he is completely aware of his ugliness    at first he is like a helpless   abandoned child   desperately reaching out for love    later when he reads frankenstein s journal   and learns that he is composed of dead bodies   his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge    he is capable of killing without regret       i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground         and  then i slowly crushed his neck       and  as i killed him   i saw your face        that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator    and yet   he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable     for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all      rarely has a cinematic interpretation of   the daemon   approached the level of three dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel    another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein    in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster   god knows why !   with the power of an electrical storm    almost no time was granted on his charecter   who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel    here   branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein   establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death   sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment   and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene    branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character    on the outside he is strong   ambitious and talented scientist   but deep down he is unsecure   fragile and vaulerble   constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past    helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein s surrogate sister   who at the end becomes his wife for a little while   before death drives them apart    the rest of the cast   playing secondary characters   is solid and nothing less than convincing    visually the film is stunning   especially the makeup      the spinning camera   the constantly building up musical acore   the art direction   the production design   the costumes are all magnificent   from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests   to the plague riddled streets of ingolstadt   mary shelley s frankenstein is a wonder to behold    kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare         all  i once loved lies in a shallow grave         by  my hand          and the film ends exacly as hamlet   when the creature sets both his and his creator s body on fire    the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness    and a terrifying last close up on the creature s smiling face    can a man create life   then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him    to whom are its actions then attributable   the creature or the being who brought about its existence    shelley did not answer these questions   but she certainly posed them    following her example   branagh does the same    his film is a tragic saga about playing god    victor frankenstein is not an evil man    he wanted to change the world to the better    in this he represents everything science stands for   acting without doubts   never considering the consequences of his actions    produced by francis ford coppola   frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film   dracula      in comparison   i can say that   dracula   has visuals that even   frankenstein   can not live up to    but when it comes to story   characters and casting     frankenstein   is stronger    but stronger than both of them   on every aspect   is neil jordan s   interview with the vampire      although the film is not perfect   the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective     these minor faults are easily forgivable   as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating    branagh has probably created one of the best   if not the best   adaptions of shelly s classic novel    
Pos,    the fugitive   is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made    it takes realistic   believable characters and tells an exciting story that s totally believable throughout    this isn t an over the top action flick for the sake of action   this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly    harrison ford stars as dr   richard kimble   a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife    the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder   but is not told in a straightforward manner    we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble s perspective    hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble s wife   helen   sela ward   was murdered    we don t get to see who the killer is until much further into the story    in fact   we might even have a little doubt about kimble s innocence ourselves    the film doesn t spend much time on the details of kimble s trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story    one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck    but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated   it is actually suspenseful to watch    this movie is so incredible because it s able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable    tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard   a u   s   marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives    from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur    kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other    most of the film deals with richard s complex investigation as he tries to find the one armed man who killed his wife    ford does not have a lot of lines here   so it is stuart and twohy s script and davis s outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is    just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits   disguising himself   and doing his own detective work is very interesting    we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed   so as he learns more so do we    meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down    at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues   but richard is just too smart for them    he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery    one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor    there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo   pantoliano   and biggs   roebuck      they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer   yet they constantly start up small talk with each other   making funny wisecracks and one liners   but not in any kind of distracting manner    the final act concludes with another terrific chase    richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him   and although we get a typical fight scene   the case is far from solved    the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along   and we don t realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together    maybe the finally scene is a bit much   but it still has a believable atmosphere to it    we re so relieved when justice is served    it s not the plot is that makes   the fugitive   great   it s all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story    watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous    if only hollywood could produce more movies like this       10/31/96     1/29/97     6/13/97   [see also     nick of time   ]  
Neg, 1   he doesn t have a hard to decipher accent   2   he doesn t always speak in a monotone   and 3    his face doesn t always wear the same impassive expression    in short   the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad   but too bad to be good    unfortunately   the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle   firestorm   which is just plain awful    one of the most glaring problems with long   who made his acting debut in john woo s broken arrow   is that he s so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery    as ace firefighter jesse graves   long is supposed to be playing a bigger than life action hero    the kind of he  man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers    unfortunately   despite the best efforts of first time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner s work in the postman look stark   jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy    to put it kindly   this is not a well written motion picture    firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich   s which   taken together   form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot    the only reason this film is getting one star   instead of something lower   is that most of the fire sequences are realistic   and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively    we re introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people    during this sequence   our big burly hero proves that he s also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl and her dog   yes   the dog lives   from being broiled alive    flash forward a year    now   our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association   replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins   real actor scott glenn      but this day   our big burly hero s first in charge   isn t going to be business as usual    a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom    led by randy earl shaye   william forsythe     the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die   they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border    along the way   they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress   suzy amis      eventually   our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire   rescue the damsel in distress   defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die   and restore order to the galaxy    firestorm s director   dean semler   is a former cinematographer   he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves     so it s no surprise that the film looks good    unfortunately   that s firestorm s lone asset   and it falters near the end   when computer generated special effects fill up the screen    these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game    the action sequences   which include a variety of chases   are occasionally interesting   but never invigorating    everyone   including long   appears to be going through the motions    there isn t a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end   unless you count the forest fire   which generates some heat    as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die   william forsythe lacks panache    he s worse than a generic bad guy   he s a boring generic bad guy who doesn t have any snappy one liners to hurl at our big burly hero    my advice to scott glenn   absolute power   and suzy amis   titanic   is to accidentally forget this film the next time they re making out a resume    there s some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list       at least i hope there aren t 10 worse films than this      and i know i wasn t the only one who really disliked this movie    as the audience was filing out of the screening   i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments    the general consensus seemed to be that   although the movie sucked   the promotional key ring was cool    the problem is that fox won t be giving out key rings to regular movie goers   so that nixes any reason to see firestorm    
Pos, an energetic   visually stunning   but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d arc    in history jeanne d arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy   which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors   who can basically alter the story as they wish    she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint    a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness    director/writer luc besson    nikita     leon    portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft    besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend    he tries not to show her as a saint or a villain    he shows her as a human being    in a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky   and the air smelled of rotten flesh   it is hard to keep your sanity    the only support and hope is in god    at the age of 13   jeanne   milla jovovich   watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers    this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne s mind    god is no longer her support    he has become her obsession    she starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny    with the help of the wise yolande d aragon   faye dunaway   and charles vii   john malcovich     whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake   jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls    after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield   where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences   only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo    the movie is filled with dreamy   symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship   that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere    the film is lost in time and space   hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne s thoughts   imagination and conscience    besson s visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age   feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle    but the film is far from being flawless    the script needs a lot of polishing    except for jeanne   there are no real characters    and although a grand star cast is assembled   their characters are nothing more than props   not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing    as for the maiden of lorraine herself   she is portrayed as a simple girl   too small for her divine task    in the latter part of the film   we see her as hysterical   confused and on the brink of madness   with her past purity and innocence for ever lost    jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect    but though her screen time is incredible excessive   both malcovich    being john malcovich    and dunaway    titus    surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance    and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part    besides casting jovovich   besson s only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting    there are some viscously evil englishmen that murder   pillage and betray with a smile on their faces    and some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen   represented by the   three musketeers   of this story    the brave gilles de rais   vincent cassel     the wise aulon   desmond harrington   and the strong la hire   richard ridings      though all those actor perform well   their characters are nothing more than symbols    banners that proclaim the glory of france    and thus   there is no sense of realism in this film     the messenger  has muscles instead of brains    there is some relief in the end   where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking    dustin hoffman s appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise    jeanne s character is unlocked   but whether god was in the picture or not   is never quite explained    was she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge    or was she truly a messenger of god    the film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious    bess o messenger  is nothing more than a fairly good film    it is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater    maybe the sound   the dreamy sequences   but certainly not the dialogue    it is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv generation   that although presents some interesting material   works better when it s on the battlefield    
Neg, any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project   as a perfect murder illustrates    frankly   dial m for murder is not one of the master director s greatest efforts   so there is ample room for improvement    unfortunately   instead of updating the script   ironing out some of the faults   and speeding up the pace a little   a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder   leaving behind the nearly  unwatchable wreckage of a would be  90s thriller    almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities    the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what s going on so that these flaws in logic don t become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled    unfortunately   in a perfect murder   the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they re happening    this is a very bad sign    not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief   but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder    of course   in the case of a perfect murder   at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless   cardboard characters    a perfect murder isn t a strict remake of dial m for murder   but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott s play   which was also the source material for hitchcock s version   as well as a 1981 made for tv retelling      emily hayes   gwyneth paltrow   is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover and shaker steven hayes   michael douglas      their marriage isn t going well    emily resents steven s controlling instincts   and   as a form of rebellion   she is having an affair with a penniless painter   david shaw   viggo mortensen      when steven learns of the relationship   he decides to confront david   but his approach isn t that of a typical cuckolded husband    instead of yelling or threatening   steven offers david a proposal that s too good to resist   for $500   000 in cash   $100   000 before   the rest after     he is to break into steven s new york apartment and kill emily       of course   after getting the first payment   david never bothers to ask how he s supposed to get the rest      ultimately   i m not sure which of the three main characters we re supposed to be sympathetic to   the cold hearted husband   who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune   her mercenary lover   who is willing to do the deed for half a million   or the woman   who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair    not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable   but they re not interesting       it s possible to make a good movie with detestable characters    see reservoir dogs    but there has to be something compelling about them   which   in this case   there isn t      steven   emily   and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes    the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks    michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep    he s gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife    gwyneth paltrow   who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors   is simply awful here    she now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998 s worst thrillers   the other being hush      at least viggo mortensen   g   i    jane   has a little fun with his part   but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies    the thin supporting cast includes david suchet   the star of   poirot     as a police inspector   and sarita choudhury   kama sutra   as emily s best friend    a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end    there aren t many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script   which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start    it s surprising to see director andrew davis   the man behind the fugitive   involved in this mess   but   like his stars   he too needs to earn a living    it s just that remaking hitchcock   and doing it so badly   hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough    
Neg, cashing in on the success of white men can t jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles   including the cowboy way and drop zone     wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed   hoping that they can strike up the same success    sadly   if this dismal   cliche ridden and mind numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by   they haven t got a chance in hell of even coming close    this time out   the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops    following several run ins with their tyrannical boss   robert blake     who is obsessed with the   money train     a train which carries all the subway s takings  and will let nothing stop it   now * there s * an original plot device     harrelson s character decides to try and take off with the cash    along the way   both of them fall in love with the same woman  another transit cop who also hates her boss    this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard    you were always the better brother  etc   etc   etc       and doesn t help to add anything to the film    given a better script   better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time   the film almost went for two hours  or did it just feel like it       this film might   and i mean * might *   have turned out okay   but as it is   it is stocked with the worst action film cliches   whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time    robert blake   who plays the evil boss   has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history !  he sounds like wayne newton   and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets !  but this is only one of money train s problems    if you look at the script as if it was an action film   it lacks originality and suspense    but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film   it is even worse    the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely ain t butch and sundance    the film isn t all bad though    snipes and harrelson   when they aren t using the dumb cliches that the script gives them   make an agreeable duo   and some of the stunt work is indeed excellent    but good stunt work cannot save a bottom of the barrel action movie    if you re a really undemanding action freak   there s a chance you ll like this    but if you re looking for something original   or suspenseful   try somewhere else  i doubt you ll find it here    
Neg, hey   i ve got a great idea for a movie !  ok   here it is   we ll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so !  what s that    sounds too boring    ok   how about this then   we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours   but half of them are angry looks and half of them are   i m in pain !    looks !  what s that    that still doesn t sound funny to you    how about if we through in some   ewwwww !    looks    still not funny    if you answered   no   that doesn t sound funny     then   ding ding ding !    you re absolutely correct !  for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple   played by tim allen and kirstie alley   who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant   wayne knight   best know as newman on tv s   seinfeld     gets them in trouble for tax evasion    what ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell    what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs            namely   talent !  backing up   the married couple is brad and caroline sexton   allen and alley     a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else   but in reality are on the brink of divorce    just as their marriage seems to be hanging from it s final thread   brad discovers that his accountant   bob lachman   knight     has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton s names    the irs catches on   but since everything points back to the sexton s and not lachman   there is nothing much to do            except run away and join an amish community    first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle out loud moments   and even some decent laughs here and * way * over there   but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you ll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn    alley is absolutely unwatchable   and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade   which   i inform you   was total b   s        allen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons   nor are they very convincing as an amish couple !  this entire movie is one bad ill conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning !  the amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing    it s such a trite   stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast   noticing that they re all predominantly tv figures   were probably the only ones they could get !  bryan spicer s directing doesn t help one bit   either    in fact   listing spicer s filmography   which includes the first   power rangers   movie and the big screen adaption of mchale s navy   is more of an insult than a r   sum   !  now that i ve pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground   i will let you in on the best thing about it    it bumped seven films up a notch on my   worst of   1997 movie list    that s right   thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the year s worst   six films are now not seemingly as bad   and a smile like yours   previously inhabiting the number ten spot   now doesn t have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list    if you look at it in that respect   for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all !  
Pos, in 1994   an insider s look at a scandal ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination   closely based on clinton s 1992 campaign   was written anonymously   former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship      now   the book   primary colors   has been made into a movie   directed by mike nichols   and   in light of recent presidential scandals   seems to be more relevant than ever    but the film is more than a diatribe against   or a paean in praise of   the president    it is a fascinating look at the political machinery   and the ethical quagmire   that surround modern politics    jack stanton   john travolta   is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination    he is charismatic   but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign   and strains his relationship with his wife   susan   emma thompson      the film is told from the point of view of henry burton   adrian lester     grandson of a civil rights leader   who is swept away by stanton s ideals and helps to organize the campaign    he joins political strategist richard jemmons   billy bob thornton   looking an awful lot like james carville     and campaign advisor daisy green   maura tierney      governor stanton s past repeatedly pops up to haunt him   a fact that his chief rival   lawrence harris   kevin cooney     consistently uses to his advantage    to help clean up the stanton campaign   jack and susan bring in an old friend   libby   the dustbuster   holden   kathy bates      the acting throughout primary colors is superb    it would be worth seeing the movie for bates  wild performance alone    she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance    travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton   although his accent does stray a little    emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can t let anything show that might hurt the presidential run    the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other   or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom    primary colors treads lightly on this issue    though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat   and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans   the movie touches on few actual political issues    in fact   most of the   bad guys   are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house    rather than issues   the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control    although the film strays into some obviously non clinton territory   it is difficult to completely separate it from reality   particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president s current troubles      primary colors  chief problem is its length    it runs about 15 minutes too long    there are some scenes which could have easily been cut    for example   midway through the film   the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists    the scene s only apparent purpose is to establish stanton s character   which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film    the extra length isn t long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying   but it mars an otherwise excellent film    republicans   democrats   and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors    it s a funny   and at some times shocking   look at the modern political process    
Pos, in recent years   harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence   scowling through the likes of tom clancy s jack ryan series    the fugitive    and last year s smash  air force one    that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system    apparently   it was just lying dormant    with ivan reitman s enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure  six days    seven nights    the lovable scoundrel is back   giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons    ford plays quinn harris   a carefree and slightly slobby   endearingly so   pilot in the tropics whose broken down plane crashes in a storm   stranding him and his charter   new york magazine editor robin monroe   anne heche     on a deserted island    of course   the sophisticated robin and the salt of the earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down   and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting    while some of the lines fall flat   the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche    both actors   who have largely done serious works as of late   seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders   and they deliver their zingers   as weak as they sometimes are   with beguiling abandon    naturally   there s nothing like a life threatening crisis to bring two people together   and quinn and robin s warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates    granted   some conflict needed to be introduced on the island   but this tacked on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes    but the point is to get the two together   and their newfound affection causes complications for both   but mostly robin   who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank   david schwimmer     who frantically awaits her return on the home island    reitman   and old   reliable hand at breezy comedies   keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action oriented sequences    his big accomplishment   however   is bringing the old   smiling ford back    as appealing and charismatic as he always is   ford hasn t been quite this charming and affable in years   he s obviously having a blast   and the audience cannot help but have one along with him    holding her own is heche   whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be   as the plane goes down   she frantically pops stress pills      she can take her lumps   physical and otherwise   just as well as quinn   making her a formidable foil and ideal match    formulaic and light as a feather    six days    seven nights  could be cited as a classic example of the summer   popcorn   movie season s lack of substance    it s certainly fluff   but it s unpretentious   undemanding   and  most importantly  fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach    pass the popcorn    
Pos, it s an interesting premise    our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real    in truth   our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains    what we see   what we do   everything around us is nothing more than a computer generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence    our bodies   severely atrophied   are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet    the sci fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along    the matrix isn t it   the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network   a sham world   the ability to plug one s brain into a computer   has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator   dark city   and a few star trek episodes   both classic and next generation      what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought provoking    keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo   who is plucked out of the artificial world   known as the matrix   by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines    the group s leader   morpheus   laurence fishburne     has chosen neo because he believes neo is   the one   who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence    >from the beginning of the film   we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out    this   in a lesser movie would be annoying   but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun    what is reality    what is a sham    the film turns our very perception of life on its side    more than once   we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality   or live a life of relative bliss   oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings    as viewers   this is intriguing enough   so imagine what it would be like for neo    and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves    reeves   whom i ve never really cared for as an actor   is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness   and little subtlety    he was good in speed   for example   but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds    neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely   so much of my expectation was happily for naught    in a couple of places   the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature   and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski    i mean   since bill and ted s excellent adventure   what movie could you say really   utilized   keanu reeves    more interesting than reeves is fishburne   who s morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions   and convincingly so    very surprising for a sci fi movie    fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout   as if he always knows what to expect    this helps to further the aura of his character s proficiency and extensive knowledge    hugo weaving as agent smith   one of the artificial intelligence s anti intruder programs   is also good playing his deadpan   no nonsense   kick ass role   which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time    unfortunately   when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row   the nature of his character s speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive    carrie anne moss plays trinity   morpheus s number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo    although her character is somewhat inconsistent   moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn t in the picture    there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects    many methods of imagery are employed   from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics    of special note is the use of the   freeze and turn   effect where the entire scene is frozen   turned   then continued from a new angle    this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi circle   with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends    the motion cameras film the action   and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once    place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second    pretty slick    the matrix drips with style    from the clothing to the music to the action   we re watching an exaggerated version of what we re used to    much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film   there s a lot of kung fu   there s a lot of gunplay    when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon   much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion    there s also the element of the japanese action cartoon   called anime by aficionados     especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects    combined   it s really like no live action film i have ever seen    the film is not without its faults    some of the scenes and ideas are   borrowed   a little too liberally from other films   and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing    some of the lines are also pretty bad   in one instance   a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying   and it wasn t meant to be a joke    however   these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci fi film that for once does more than merely entertain    
Neg, ladies and gentlemen   payback is the most expensive episode of   the equalizer   i ve ever seen    gibson plays porter   a burglar shot and left for dead by his wife   deborah kara unger   in an all too brief cameo   and partner   henry   after a successful heist    as a morgue attendant sets about removing the bullets from porter s back   porter miraculously springs back to life    he makes it his mission   as a walking dead man without a conscience   to exact revenge on those who screwed him and reclaim his share of the loot       in a running gag   porter demands $70 000   but everybody mishears him and assumes he s after the entire $130 000 haul      in his travels   or travails     porter encounters several other one named villainous cretins like fairfax   james coburn as a white haired   millionaire thief   and carter   kristofferson   as a brown haired   millionaire thief the kingpin of the obligatory   operation        helgeland s film   which was recut by mel the producer   is devoid of an imperative dime store charm    the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly   a   because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs   and b   because mel s schtick doesn t evolve from act one he s the terminator stranded in a plot without a sci fi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone    payback should have been called playback   it s a 102 minute loop of the same short sequence       mel     i want my money      anonymous villain     no      mel shoots gun    anonymous villain dies    mel meets up with his hooker friend   bello      second verse   same as the first      it s not porter s single mindedness that robs the film of snap   crackle   and pop   as a character who has already   died   once   he has nothing to lose and so much to gain    the movie lacks danger    the only thing porter is in jeopardy of is putting the audience to sleep    payback has a gritty   metallic look to it that also becomes monotonous   its cinematography would be more appropriate in one of those bleak urban psychodramas that come out of england every couple of months       director of photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello   so va va va voom in permanant midnight   to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig      to analyze such mediocrity is to grant payback far more attention than it deserves    perhaps only someone as experienced with antagonists as protagonists as tarantino look what he did with the similar hero less botched robbery tale reservoir dogs could have pulled off this material   a loose remake of john boorman s point blank      the movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction   all women are femme fatales   even the cops are in on it   etc     and crosses them with the conventions of cheesy tv crime melodramas   death is never in the cards for the main character   etc     but transcends neither    
Pos, note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction   the cinematic output from its creator   quentin tarantino   has been surprisingly low    oh   he s been busy    doing the talk show circuit   taking small roles in various films   overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn   making cameo appearances on television shows   providing a vignette for the ill fated anthology four rooms    everything   it seems   except direct another feature length film    it s been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr   tarantino s new feature film   jackie brown   one of the most anticipated films of the year   and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s    things aren t going well for jackie brown   pam grier      she s 44 years old   stuck at a dead end job     $16   000 a year   plus retirement benefits that aren t worth a damn     as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america    and she s just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette   portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton   and police officer mark dargus   michael bowen   smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun runner ordell robbie   samuel l   jackson     who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry   robert forster      the loquacious ordell   based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny   bong hitting surfer girl melanie   bridget fonda   and agreeable crony louis gara   robert de niro   hang out   operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat   and he s soon out to silence jackie brown    meanwhile   the authorities  target is ordell   and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half million dollars    only through a series of clever twists   turns   and double crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses    although jackie brown marks mr   tarantino s first produced screenplay adaptation   based on the elmore leonard novel   rum punch       there s no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film    while he s adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense   the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character s now black    in terms of ambiance   the film harkens back to the 1970s   from the wall to wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets    even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions    the opening sequence featuring ms   grier wordlessly striding through the lax   funky music blaring away on the speakers   is emblematic of films of that era    the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995   but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro    of course   nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads   and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists   backstabbing   and deceptions deliciously unfold   the strength of jackie brown is the quiet   understated relationship developed between jackie and max   when they kiss   it s perhaps the most tender scene of the year    tenderness   in a quentin tarantino film    sure   there ve been moments of sweetness in his prior films    the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer   or even in reservoir dogs   where a deep   unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters    but for the most part   mr   tarantino s films are typified by manic energy   unexpected outbursts of violence   and clever   often wordy   banter    these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown   but what s new here is a different facet of his storytelling    a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent   and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation    this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr   tarantino as simply a helmer of slick   hip crime dramas with fast talking lowlifes   and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent   he s the real deal    this new aspect of mr   tarantino s storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character    that of the world weary   sensitive   and exceedingly professional max cherry   whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching    mr   forster s nuanced   understated performance is the best in the film   he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie   we smile along with him    much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation era icon pam grier in the lead   with the wags buzzing that mr   tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta s then sagging career    as it turns out   ms   grier is solid in the film s title role   although nothing here forces her to test her range    i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection   though    she s been working steadily over the years   often in direct to video action flicks   but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton s mars attacks !  and larry cohen s original gangstas   where she first teamed up with mr   forster      of course   it s true that her role here was a godsend    a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress   let alone one of her age and current status in the industry    while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone   it marks tremendous growth of mr   tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding   and whose characterizations have never been better    and while the film s narrative doesn t really warrant a running time of 155 minutes   it s filled with such sumptuous riches   ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining   inconsequential conversations between the characters   that there wasn t an unengaging moment    with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt   it ll

 it s got style   it s got tough guys talkin  shite and it s got plenty of bullets to go around    a definite hunk a hunk a burnin  adventure !  a guy s guy movie through and through   and one that ll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff    it s not very original   it goes on for a little too long   but costner and russell make it happen   as two shite kickin  elvis lovers   who don t stop till they   more or less   drop    this movie s got some pretty intensive shoot out scenes   one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i ve ever witnessed   featuring several elvises with guns a blazin  and the king s music playing in the background   and a decent helping of double crosses   sharp dialogue and funny moments    in fact   even though the cast is filled with many name actors   b actors as they might be for the most part     most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim    but the true glue that holds this film together   other than the spirit of elvis himself   is costner and russell   who play their badass characters to the t   sure   russell s been down this road before   but costner surprised me with his nastiness    i guess he s pissed at all the box office bombs that he s been in of late   but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here    in the end   the bottom line with this movie is having fun   kickin  ass and making sure there s enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards    and smoke  em if you got  em   folks !  there is also this one really great show down scene between costner and a cop   that ll have you crackin  up and lovin  it all at the same time    the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that ll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next    it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background   with plenty   and i mean plenty   of camera tricks   cuts and edits   but for this kind of flick   it actually works    the film is not perfect though   it starts off with a pretty big bang   but then pulls a way of the gun on us   and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle   while characters intermingle and disperse    i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots   and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well    and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega hot in the movie    no       okay    well i just did !  i coulda done without her whole   romance   angle   but to be honest   it doesn t take up much of the film   which is generally covered in blood   explosions   guts and elvis nods    try to see how many   inside   connections to the king you can guess    of course   it s no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind    i also like these types of   guy   movies a lot   and even though the film doesn t bring much originality to the table   it does offer a pretty coherent story   some nice twists and turns   humor and a big ol  helping of whoop ass coming straight from costner and russell s respective boots    probably not a film for everyone   but definitely for those who enjoy the guns   the charismatic bad guys and a fun   if entirely disposable   adventure    now see how many elvis songs i ve used to pun my way through this phony review below    the elvis songs also recommend this movie !  so whether you re lonesome tonight or any other night   remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets   leave your little sister at home   bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse   cause this movie ain t one to return to the sender    i really beg of you   whether you re stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel   to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender    and no suspicious minds either   folks   cause i got stung by this movie   i mean it really shook me up   and unless you re the devil in disguise himself   i think you won t be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either    so don t be cruel   don t turn away   don t curl up with your latest flame tonite   whether she be a hard headed woman or not   and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film    it s now or never   folks    trust me   i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i d seen so far this year is far behind me    joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building    thank you       thank  you very much !

Pos, roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton    this italian film star   best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther   has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust    but benigni s life is beautiful   la vita e bella   is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love   devotion and sacrifice    the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni s guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore    like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him   most notably the almost forgotten harry langdon   benigni s guido has a childlike innocence    he ignores the growing anti semitism of the fascist government    instead   guido ardently falls in love and persues dora   a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official    in benigni s tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate   yet slapstick   encounter    guido wins dora    they marry    fast forward about five years    guido   dora   and their 5 year old son   giosue     giorgio cantarini   are a happy family    guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore    but racial and anti semitic tensions are on the rise in italy   and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities    the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp    here   guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son   but to keep him from being exterminated    it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched    for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror   the pain   the unimaginable suffering of a schindler s list    true   many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over   and most were not sent to the death camps   but to work camps where they were used as slave labor    unlike steven spielberg   benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust    his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child    for guido   to save his son   transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game    giosue   must follow the rules without question to amass 1   000 points    the winner takes home a tank    therefore   guido tells him   he must remain hidden in the barracks    he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him    guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates    guido   lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners   instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive    throughout their imprisonment   guido s quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm s way    ultimately   the allies rescue the camp    in a poignant scene   giosue   comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound    the boy goes wide eyed with wonderment and delight   thinking he has won the game    the price for his victory is most high    benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell   a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness    life is beautiful is a fantasy   a fable    it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust    those who object to it are missing its point    and that is simply where there is hope   where there is life and where there is love   the spark of humanity will never be extinguished    committed to lifelong learning through effective communication  
Pos, seen at the 21st portland international film festival  film title   supermarket woman director   juzo itami country   japan 1997 cinematography   yonezo maeda music   toshiyuki honda cast   nobuko miyamoto   masahitko tsugawa   shiro ito   yuji miyake   akiko matsumoto super features   typical itami film        funny and pointed in its own way    if you don t care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket   then this film is not for you          maybe it is better to ignore it   as this strong and biting satire   as only juzo itami can deliver   will give you an insight as to what some foods go through    having   in the past   made films that pulled every punch imaginable   from the family traditions   the funeral     to taxes   a taxing woman & a taxing woman returns     to the diabolical gangsters   minbo     to hospitals   the seriously ill     juzo itami   this time takes on the supermarkets  own war   to get the consumers    and while this film has its funny side   in the crazy situations that it creates   it also shows another side   which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer    goro has a supermarket    and a competitor comes into the neighborhood   trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket    bargains galore   its name   has in mind the closure of goro s humbler venue   so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can    goro hires hanako   a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management   than they are in anything else    hanako   as she gets familiar with the operation   discovers many of the tricks of the trade   done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market    and the procedures   are not always   fresh   food   but a new packaging and a new date   to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves    hanako s ideas take hold   starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket   being that they do not even shop there at all    and hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference    if not cause some serious problems in the running of the store    a price error   forces them to give away eggs for very low prices   and causes the store a few hassles   but   it brought the people in   and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things    as the operation gets stronger   the competition also has trickery up its sleeve   and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers   as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors    eventually these people are found out   and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully   until in the end they all have a showdown    and here   the truth and honesty win out   and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent    in the process   they also find that   freshness     with some very funny jokes on this word as well   becomes a much more important tool than they imagined    with some very nice performances   in this hectic   and fast paced film   this film gives us a sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways   although a failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much   even though towards the end it is suggested    but this would take away from the satire and its strengths    with food gags all over the place   the film lets you have it    and what fun it is    worth seeing       editorial   the director of this film   juzo itami   died shortly after the film was finished   and he left behind a legacy of comedy and satire that is rare   and uncompromising    we would wish that he had been able to make one about film making   of which he must have had a few stories to tell   but we will have to do with much of the japanese society   and its many errant ways          not to say that these things do not happen anywhere else          america is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all   should anyone have the guts to tackle it        we could learn something along the way   too          worth seeing   specially   is a taxing woman and its follow up a taxing woman returns    the funeral is also good   although not as funny as the later films    tampopo is also very enjoyable    all four of these films are available in video   which means your best local site for foreign film may have them        ask for it    
Neg, starring kiefer sutherland   reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen    freeway is giving me second thoughts    freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood    only in the nineties   little red riding hood is a foul mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon   and the big bad wolf is a serial killer   keifer sutherland      to top that pathetic premise off    reese goes to visit granny and you ll never guess who s waiting under the cover s in granny s bed    keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented   yet underrated actors   and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star    so what are they doing in this movie    after seeing the end result   undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question    you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review    the answer is quite simple    i dont want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary    i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it    note to keifer   you wonder why you aren t a bigger star in hollywood    because you keep making movies like this    note to reese   you were great in fear   what happened this time    note to both   don t worry about it too much   no one saw this movie anyway    bottom line    i m still shaking my head    don t waste your time on this turkey    if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie   go rent flatliners or young guns    reese witherspoon s abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear   a great thriller    do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies    but stay as far away from freeway as you possibly can    
Neg, the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury s love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon    as always   jacobi s acting is impeccable   but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque    the movie convincingly argues that francis   played by jacobi   was a completely despicable and vain individual   but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude    when interviewed by a fawning talk show host   francis calls his style   chance brushstrokes      starting with a burglary of francis s flat   the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie    the camera shots are heavy on the avant garde angles    lots of wide angle close ups and distorted shots filmed through colored glass reflections    the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man    daniel craig   in a lifeless performance   plays the burglar and boxer   george dyer    when francis lays eyes on him after the break in   francis promises not to call the police if he ll stay for sex    he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed    he thinks that francis s paintings have   no bloody use     and the movie presents no counterargument    writer maybury barely outlines francis s character   and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma    we learn little of george other than francis s reason for liking him    george s   amorality and innocence      francis s love of sadomasochism is shown early and often       boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex     he reflects to george on the way to watch a boxing match    as the fighter s head is sliced open with a heavy blow   the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood    francis appears to be in complete ecstasy    another of francis s favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities    as the carnage mounts   we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience    in a film that tries obsessively to shock   one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident    francis s mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother   the father   and the boy    sometimes the script throws us tidbits of francis s wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful         i m optimistic by nature    i m optimistic about nothing         loneliness is my only true companion        we learn more details about francis s makeup techniques than about the man himself    he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth    full of metaphorical interpretations   the film s best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom    mistaking francis s picture of a toilet for the genuine article   he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly    like a parody of a bad art house movie   love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by a director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling    by the end   the audience hasn t learned any more than it could have in a three minute sketch    love is the devil runs 1   30    the film is not rated but should be considered nc 17 for violence   profanity   graphic sex   nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers    
Pos, trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda   the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter    the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60 s   then cut to the harsh reality of the present    sheffield has become some sort of a semi slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel factories   a once flourishing industry    gaz   carlyle   spends most of his time in the worker s club   a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers    he and his `plump  friend dave   addy   as well as their former foreman gerald   wilkinson   have been sitting around the club for months without any `call for duty     what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of child support money to his ex wife    suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son   he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild idea to get the money he desperately requires    dave and gerald too have problems of their own    on top of his lack of employment   dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his`plump  appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as 6 months   leaving home for `work  when he was actually a long standing member of the worker s club    there we have it   people with real problems and a not so practical solution for them    gaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag   to perform a strip act at the local pub    in gaz s own words while looking at an add for a strip act featuring hunky `beautiful  men   `if women are willing to pay for this   they sure as well will pay for real men     the full monty is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all    it is a small film which delves in the harsh reality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to    it also is a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of human factor going for it    never for once   was it trying to be manipulative at all   the full monty was true to itself all the way    while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high   audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of a laugh   something lacking in many comedy films   wannabes     from hollywood    other than carlyle   who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting   the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on screen    however   the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying    carlyle s work here is a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting   implying real acting skill and flexibility on screen    kudos to the people involved in this film   especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your just another striptease    already a critical and financial success for such a small film   the full monty is a humble film which deserves applause throughout    while titanic managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way   the full monty gives one the same satisfaction       in  half the time    
Neg, watching the movie   i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup   cute  n cuddly   computer generated monkey    if the monkey died   the movie got an extra half star    alas   the monkey showed up at the end   unharmed   to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs    what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars    that s pretty generous   considering the movie s camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek    when will robinson   jack johnson   teaches his pet robot about friendship   you are actually supposed to buy it    so why such a seemingly high rating    there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage    first   we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater    the sound and screen kicked ass    nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did   and i don t necessarily mean that in a good way      also   there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons   or getting caught up in the movie s tension    i even liked the computer generated settings    i usually prefer to see models or sets   but the cg was more detailed than i ve seen in a lot of movies   it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities    also   gary oldman is never a bad actor   even though he is typecast as a villain    william hurt isn t too bad either    neither actor had a great role   but their performances were watchable    and perhaps i shouldn t admit this   but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood    there is very little swearing or blood   there is a strong moral message   saccharine though it is   there is a bit of romance   whose culmination after 2 hours is a   real   kiss    no sex      it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six    those movies were probably as bad as lost in space   but at the time   they were manna from heaven    that type of moviemaking is a lost art    now for the bad news    worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue    it s squeaky clean   family fun   trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction       you better hold on to your joystick     is one such line    and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs   they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign    second worst   and closely related   is the screenplay    the story s exposition takes place at a press conference   which allows the writers to explain what s happening with the least amount of creativity   effort   or interest    once the story gets going   i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while   but on the whole   the situations that arise are silly and contrived    when gary oldman easily reprograms will s pet robot to kill the robinsons   my friend summed it up perfectly     he flipped the switch to  evil        then there s the tone of the movie    the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson    then it could be an adventure movie    they re mostly right   except that johnson   will   wasn t a good enough actor to carry it off    still   that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination    just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn t mean that we have to bow to a   promise keepers   notion of who s the center of a family    many quality family films have been made with a non traditional family structure   fly away home comes to mind   to much better effect    and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie    in star wars   the rebels were the good guys    we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system    in lost in space   the rebels are the bad guys   a terrorist force that must be killed   crushed and silenced so that our children may live free    that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists    finally   a few specific details deserve criticism    the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056    why    why bother saying what year this is    just tell us it s the future    i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997    setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won t be timeless   not that this movie was really in the running anyway        then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole    this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny s barber chair   and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven t learned a thing about ergonomics    one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed   it made lost in space look cool    the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and   out of context   made it sound hip    this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie    but if that s the best part of the movie   i can t in good conscience recommend it    still   if you get stuck seeing it   as we did   you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance   think of liking bad movies as a child   and bring along your   bad movie bingo   cards    
Pos, what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection    sometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have   i will prefer it to a better made film that is not as thought provoking    the thin red line is flawed but it provokes    terence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war    unlike this year s saving private ryan   which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof   the thin red line simply says war is waste    while that might seem obvious to some   only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is    saving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost   the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs    one message is not necessarily more correct than the other    it just depends on one s point of view    in malick s film   war is set in a tropical paradise   and john toll s cinematography is beyond lush    the setting poses the question   why are we fighting in the face of such beauty    in saving private ryan   the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go    in the thin red line   the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place    they are just like the americans    frightened and angry   grieving and praying    all that separates them is war    the flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice overs    unbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious   sometimes corny   the voice overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary    dispensing with them   malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur    instead   he gets distracting self consciousness    aside from that   malick s direction is stunning    the tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary    sean penn   elias koteas   and nick nolte give the best performances    penn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism   koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain   and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle    john travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles    ultimately however   the thin red line s interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama    it has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure   but malick clearly has different things on his mind    has no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative    what malick is working with is theme   and in that   the thin red line is most provoking    
Pos, when i saw the trailer for this film   i laughed harder than i had in quite some time    while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it   i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good    i m happy to say that there s something about mary is not one of those trailer let downs    in fact   watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours    the film opens up in flashback to 1985   at a high school in cumberland   rhode island    ted stroehmann   ben stiller   is a social reject who can t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom   until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren   w    earl brown     who s being harassed by one of the school jocks    it seems warren s sister is the campus queen   mary jensen   cameron diaz     who is impressed with ted s willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother   despite a very real chance of getting beaten up    mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom    ted was just flattered that she even knew his name    unfortunately   prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper   at which every man in the theater will wince     and is sent to the hospital    fast forward to the present   where ted has cleaned himself up   now writes for a magazine   but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years   mary   whom he hasn t seen since that fateful day    with the help of his friend dom   chris elliott     ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy   matt dillon   to track down his only love    however   when pat finds mary   he falls for her too   and soon the both of them are competing for her affections    there s something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly   who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin    not exactly intelligent comedies   they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co workers to think you had such a great time watching them    with their current film   the farrelly brothers have come up with something you ll not only enjoy   but also won t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler    the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles   from the subtle to the ridiculous   and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some   seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers  last two films   they almost all work    i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on    one minute you ll be laughing at something ted says   and the next you ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary s apartment    one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller    he is perfectly cast in the role of ted   because he s a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation    ted s a nice fellow and tries to do his best   but for some reason or another things just don t always work out    it s comical   but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top    actually   i ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid eighties    the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money   entitled the hustler of money    in it   stiller played wince   not vince   who is taken under the wing of an older man   played by john mahoney   to become a big time bowling hustler    it was parody at its finest   more of which showed up in the short lived   the ben stiller show   on the fox network in late  92/early  93    like   the critic     which aired on abc   then fox     i still mourn that show s cancellation    cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film   although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates   and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper thin at times    however   diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm   that you can still see why she s got guys just falling over each other to be with her    heck   i even found her laugh to be cute   even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week    my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn t change   and you know   it s really true    he and ralph macchio must hang out or something    maybe they live in dick clark s pool house    anyway   here s another good piece of casting   as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary s heart    the supporting performances are also good    chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss   yes   check it out next time     and less annoying than in cabin boy    lin shae   who plays mary s neighbor magda   and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin     provides some good laughs   especially in scenes with her benji like dog   which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film    lee evans   as mary s friend tucker   displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist    the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j   strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren t any noticeable times where the film drags    the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes    they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot relevant information right toward the camera    it s a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film    after that it got a little annoying   and it s unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow    fortunately   filled with sight gags   humorous lines   and solid comedic acting   there s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater

Neg, a silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy   with its main asset being a beautiful film location along spain s mountainous coastline    howard pigeon   jeff goldblum   is a 40 year old mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to a wife constantly nagging him   elizabeth   mimi rogers      after a surprise birthday party for him   where his wife bawls him out for coming late to his surprise party   he confides to his best friend that he can t stand it anymore   and then tells him his plan to kill her while vacationing in the same barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon    jeff is going through a severe mid life crises   worried that he looks older than his age    he incessantly talks to himself   mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for a second time   and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive    he stutters and acts like a man who has lost his confidence    things change on their vacation   as elizabeth makes an effort to be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch    he nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room    by accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting    when other hotel guests and staff come to check about the gunshot   he nervously explains that it was the tv    realizing how unworkable his plan is   he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth    but elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip   and when after a great deal of effort to get a reservation at the hotel s 5 star restaurant he insists on eating in the room   she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him    as a result   he goes to the police to report her missing    while with the police   a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone    his boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him   and he gets a job promotion    but soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water   giving the police cause to arrest him and search his home    there they find letters he has written incriminating him to the murder    the police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room    in jail   things look bad for him    no one believes him   including his friends and lawyer    his boss fires him and the papers have a field day with the headline story   pigeon   a jailbird    out on bail   he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife    through a call placed on his credit card   he tracks her down to a mountain resort    once there he learns that she took a hike up the steep mountain and he gets a priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story    the film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance    he is someone coming apart by the seams   while mimi rogers is his perfect foil    it was mostly pantomine humor   with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation    a very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd    the film just didn t take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it   so it had no chance for black humor to develop    it instead played its set up of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw

Pos, at first glance   three kings looks to be just another war movie   the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember    the 90s version   it definitely is   just another war movie    not in your dreams !  imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan   thats three kings for you    believe it or not   it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter    the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war   with the allied troops victorious    majpr archie gates   clooney   leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post war looting spree   the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert    as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home   this `wild bunch goes awol on an armed hum vee   the vehicle of choice of the us army      they soon find out that they have much resistance   as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces    frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men   they become consciously attacked by their own morals    as the film begins to roll   it seemed to have a rather `light mood to it    `special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light hearted funny action movie    three kings is much smarter than that    as the conflict becomes more and more complex   the audience will be trapped in a limbo   trying to stay focussed on that light mood/serious mood that the film seem to portray    i personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film   trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity    this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant    action sequences are not shot as your old fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs in your face war violence    they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close ups and pauses   right before the action starts    not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style   tons of them starring clint eastwood      great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film   the screenwriter and the director    three kings ranks among the best films of the year   well   for me at least    highly recommended    
Pos, denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances    this perhaps may be washington s very best to date    he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent   this season   to become his character   copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly    his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting   the hurricane   a much better film than it actually is    when his rubin   hurricane   carter feels pain and is tormented by racism   he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy   disgust   and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices    the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago    the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone   as his tortured carter   sum up the troubles of racism in america s history    he is that amazing    the problem with   the hurricane   is that when compared to washington   all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles    mainly because the script focuses so much on carter   that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors    this is   without a doubt   washington s movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying   it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars    denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance    as rubin carter   we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system    >from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit    then after a successful marriage and boxing career   he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder    carter s second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous   powerful white men who refused to let him succeed    from these past experiences in jail   carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america    after several court appeals   an autobiography   and many public marches for his freedom   carter remained locked in prison    it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter s book in the 1980 s   that a serious battle for freedom took place    the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released    the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation    washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again   he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career    the devastation in washington s eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it    in the hole   carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot    his anger is heightened to a point of no control    we see multiple carters   a violent angry one   a silent passive one   and a mediator    we see an emotional boxing match inside carter s head    from this point in the hole to the end of the film   this fight continues    it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite    when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison   the angry carter at first erupts    white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life   this reminder leads to anger in his head    however   as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him    he realizes that society is changing    that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world    very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here    if only the other actors had this same determination    dan hedaya   ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around    it felt like his character was taken straight out of a   scooby doo   episode   he would have gotten away with it if it wasn t for those annoying little kids       the kids   in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable    the lawyers who help release carter also are underused   as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard   the complete opposite of his character in   shawshank redemption        there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears    hedaya was superb in   clueless     same for david paymer in   get shorty     harris yulin in   ghostbusters   and liev schreiber in   the daytrippers      it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles    on the other hand   it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin   hurricane   carter    this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get    
Pos, every once in a while   when an exceptional family film comes along   i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been   with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children   it is remarkable how many non disney films disappear in a couple of weeks    now i see that in so doing   i have unfairly ghettoized these films    so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents   but to anyone who wants to support smart   funny   energetic film making   see matilda    see it in a theater   rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video    see the best film i have seen in 1996    not the best children s film       the  best film    period    based on a story by roald dahl   it tells of young matilda wormwood   mara wilson     an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents   harry   danny devito     a crooked used car salesman   and zinnia   rhea perlman     a simple minded bingo addict    the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists   and when they do   it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books    when they finally do send her to school   it is to crunchem hall   a bleak place run by cruel   child hating miss agatha trunchbull   pam ferris      but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher   miss honey   embeth davidtz     who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness    matilda also discovers another special talent    the ability to move things with her mind    which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull s cruelty    it was this spring s james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them   and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda    and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton   matilda soars on the cock eyed direction of danny devito    devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses   and he contributes some memorable images    in one scene   an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer   later   an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert    matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale    it is also characteristic of the best children s tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don t realize that they are learning them    there is a hilarious moment when matilda s television addicted father snatches away the book she is reading   in a wicked joke   he thinks  moby dick  is pornographic   and forces her to watch an inane game show   hosted by jon lovitz   in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around    matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment   and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child    that because   i m big and you re little   i m right and you re wrong      more specifically   it has as its heroine an intelligent   self confident girl who struggles successfully against other people s notions of how she should behave    it is no coincidence that matilda was co written by robin swicord   who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women    finally   matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment   it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word    devito knows enough to make matilda fast paced and appealing to children   taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy   including a great chase through her dark house    the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable   with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character    but there are also many   many delights for adults   including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda s classmates recite in sing song fashion   there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda s father    i can t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted    matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling    i will see it again   and years from now i will watch it with my children    and now i will stop   because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin   and there is a seat in that theater you should be in   if you have a child or ever were a child    
Neg, hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell    the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films    in a nutshell   the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous    with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership   a lot of hong kong s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u   s   productions    such talents as jackie chan   rush hour     chow yun fat   anna & the king   the corrupter   and yuen woo ping   the matrix   have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results    now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai    unfortunately   romeo must die   bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong s rhythms    the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking    enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing   russell wong      kai confronts po sing   jon kit lee     the son of kai s boss and leader of the local chinese family    a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai   who handily kicks and punches his opponents down    it s not until club owner silk   rapper dmx     bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends    the following morning po sing is found dead    suspicions escalate   as issac o day   delroy lindo   is told of the murder    his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture    issac implores his chief of security   mac   issiah washington   to watch after his son and daughter    the scene shifts to a prison in china   where han sing   jet li   learns of his brothers murder    he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined    hung upside down by one foot   han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work    escaping to the u   s   han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother s death       romeo must die   is in many ways a fun film    it is both absurd and assured    the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes   the godfather      the relationship between jet li s han and aaliyah s trish o day reminds us of abel ferrera s   china girl     except that romeo must die s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another    their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history    the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable    li   of course has the showiest part   having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination    allayah   in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace    it s obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic    but   still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it    delro lindo as issac o day carries himself well in the film    an unsung and under appreciated actor   mr   lindo turns out the films best performance    the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d   b   woodside as issac s son   colin    the performance is undirected   with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in    an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written    first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film    having a career as one of the industry s best cinematographers   bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots   and   romeo must die   does look good    but the pacing of the film is lethargic   only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes    the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in    the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing    and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah s bodyguard   maurice has no comic timing whatsoever    the best things about the film are its fight scenes    jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles    one needs only to see his film   fist of legend   to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat    here   jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that   lethal weapon 4     jet s u   s   debut   didn t allow    unfortunately   a lot of jet s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision    also   romeo must die   must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film   and that is an x ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film   showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent    obviously a homage to the famed x ray scene from sonny chiba s   streetfighter     the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film    it s as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted    one problem though about the fight scenes    those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon    they do have an internal rhythm to them    a heartbeat   so to speak in their choreography    the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance    this is created by the performance   the direction and the editing    here in   romeo must die     there is no staccato    every fight scene   even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern    the rhythm is monotonous    a hong kong film has a tempo that changes   heightening its emotional impact     rmd  is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo   not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever    a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan s films      watch the restaurant fight from the film   rush hour   and notice that the context of the fight   while technically amazing is rather flat   the framing and cut always do not help      now look at the warehouse fight from   rumble in the bronx      there you have a heartbeat   and emotional draw that doesn t let the audience catch its breath    the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly   causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted    here in  romeo must die    the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl    jet li is a grand and personable screen presence    it s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here    one day filmmakers here in the u   s   will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity    until then   we ll be left with emotionally hollow product like   the replacement killer   and   currently   romeo must die      
Pos, i m not really sure what to think about   crash      on the surface   it s a cold   boring   unerotic porn with name starts   a name director   and some cool camerawork    i mean   it left me completely bored   unsatisfied   and generally kinda weirded out    but then again   not every film s supposed to leave you entertained       crash   is structured to play like a porn flick   but with significantly more plot and dialogue    while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex   we also have a skimpy little plot going on   mostly towards the beginning     and maybe just a hair of characterization    not to mention the acting is generally pretty good   and we don t really see a lot of the actors completely exposed    but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience    this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of   henry and june   or the just plain horniness of   say     deep throat     not that i ve seen it      if one was to be made completely hot by this film   it would probably mean they were also into the whole   auto eroticism   thing    the film leaves you cold erotically   and maybe in many other ways     but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge    the film opens up on a woman   catherine   deborah kara ungar   of   the game       pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar    suddenly   a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind   the film doesnt  show all this though   even if it is nc 17      the next scene has a film director   james   james spader     having sex with a camera woman   alice poon   in an office on the highly populated set of his movie    the next scene has the two coming together   revealing to us that they re husband and wife   and them sharing in one another s escapades    while the two are arguably freaky people   we at least know they love to live on the edge    soon afterwards   james is driving down the road at night   reclessly of course   he s reading something     when he drifts into the other lane   and then hits another car face on    james is not killed   but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat   obviously dying     leaving the driver   helen remington   holly hunter   in a porn       also alive    the two go through therapy together   and when getting out   they run into eachother again    when james gives her a ride home   they almost get into another accident   and immeadiately afterwards   they go to an unbusy parking lot   and have a little quickie   as they were aroused by the accident    you wouldn t think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish   but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan   elias kosteas   and his crutch carrying girlfriend   gabrielle   rosanna arquette     who are also into it    vaughan is into living on the edge as they are   but he takes it to another level   he loves to recreate famous car crashes    in one scene   he and a friend   colin seagrave   peter macneill   recreate james dean s car crash without any padding or safety belts   and suffer some concussions   but nevertheless get a rush   and the attention of the police      soon   these five are all having sex with one another   be it straight   gay   or lesbian sex    while this is admittingly all a bit comical   the film is almost like a black comedy     the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who s main fetish is living on the edge    i m sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents   but i personally don t see a connection between car crashes and sex    the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush    his car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini masterpieces   we re at first not sure if they ll take place   but everytime it looks like it may occur   we gasp    then when it happens   we hold our breath    the same thing happens with sex   although not in the same fashion    these people are merely taking it to another level    the only problem with the film is that it s a tad redundant    a normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half    this goes on for about 100 minutes   and it just seems a little too long    the sex and car crashes are far between one another   and the time between them are a tad on the boring side    there s no characterization   although it could definitely be argued   that hey   it s a porn   and we re not here to sympathize    but still   they coulda cut it down a bit    but the film is saved with its presentation   as well as some other elements    the atmosphere is very dark and forboding   creating a kind of cool weird feeling    and there are several scenes are just amazing    one scene has catherine and james having sex   while she softly asks him questions about being with a man   which sounds almost erotic the way she says it    a sequence involving one character s death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs    and the final shot is shot perfectly   creating an image of a car crash   and a couple having sex in front of it   despite the fact that she s wounded    the acting is also pretty good   especially for what is almost a porn   ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn      while james spader is pretty boring   he s usually pretty intense     deborah kara ungar is amazing    she speaks all her words in almost zombie like hushes   and when she s having sex   she has a blank look on her face   not showing the viewer whether she s enjoying it or not    in one scene   she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her    holly hunter   who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this   is pretty good   and so is rosanna arquette   who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role      but the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone    he often speaks as he is out of breath   showing a definite affinity for his way of life    he has a great deal of energy in several scenes   especially one scene where he s taking photographs of a picture   and a later scene where he s getting a freaky tatoo    he and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes   foreshadowing a later scene    kosteas is a little known actor   his biggest role was casey jones in   teenage mutant ninja turtles       but here he shows a deniro like presence   hinting that he s capable of bigger roles    while i hardly enjoyed   crash     it s still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who   if the exist   are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world    these people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities   and the film   which doesn t exactly pain them in a negative light   is sucessful in bringing them to light   even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out    despite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc 17 rating   there s also an r rated version   but i wouldn t even go near that thing     anyone looking for a quick turn on should just rent a regular porno    
Neg, maybe this mission should have been scrubbed  mission to mars  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  there s a world of difference between artists and technicians    the artist has a vision to create something new    he may not do it well   it might be sloppy   but it s something you ve never seen before    a good technician can make it look good   but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else   it s going to be just a xerox    obviously successful films need both skills    brian de palma is a masterful technician    he s spent his career copying others   most notably hitchcock    he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work   but only because he has learned it by rote    aside from rare flashes of originality   his films are often soul dead    in de palma s latest   he turns his attention to stanley kubrick    to tell the truth   i enjoyed portions of this movie   but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called   2001      i enjoyed it even more when it was titled   close encounters      nasa has set its sights for mars    when the first crew meets with disaster   a rescue mission is sent to the red planet    they don t do so well either   but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut gone rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe    and it s all so boring    there are so many scenes that just don t work   it s difficult to begin    when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside down martian tornado   which looks remarkably like a sandworm from   dune     destroying everything in its path   they just hang out watching    error    the most interesting character   and that s not saying much   is killed off    error    the alien is laughable    error    the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable    error    there s some nice eyecandy    the face on mars   which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head   looks cool    a three dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world    maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic    but there s so much more that feels as if we ve been there before    from   2001     there s the rotating space station   the blinding white room    >from   close encounters     they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens    the list goes on    the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues    even gary sinise and tim robbins can t muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing    no one seems to care about anything that happens    you won t either    the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr   pepper   with a 20 foot tall logo   saves the day    they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film    
Pos, oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with !  in a perfect world     a civil action   would be a breath of fresh air    it s cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn t    it s romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book/film isn t    and   the capper   it has no distinct ending   and the law in hollywood films is that above all else   you must have an ending    even if it s based on a true story   a true story which hasn t yet ended   you must supply an ending   a false one   but an ending nevertheless    hell     a civil action   is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together   and that includes   the firm     the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic      yet it s also oddly and slightly unsatisfying    weird    this is   in fact   a steve zallian film   not just the work of a hack   and zallian is the director of the much admired   search for bobby fischer     didn t see it   and writer of none other than   schindler s list      in short   i like this guy   and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories    after all   apart from the obvious it s a holocaust film and it s a spielberg film   isn t   schindler s list   just a damn brilliant film   not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study       a civil action   is the same way   it s narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study    and it s here that the film seems to go a bit wrong    the main complaint of this film is that while   yes   it s an engrossing lawyerly tale   it has no real ending   and that s not necessarily the problem with the film    it s that it s just kind of unsatisfying    if this were a great film   it would feel complete   and still end basically the same way    but this film just seems to end   and i don t want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on   imagine   if you will   being one of those the film is about   looking forward to this film   and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter   just so the many won t bitch about what is   essentially   genuine    but the fact that it just ends is not   in all actuality   what is wrong with it    it s rather that zallian has chosen   in the last half hour   to adandon the traditional lawyer story   and chose the other part of his story   the one about the lawyer   one jan schlictman   john travolta     who s shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer   brilliant because he s manipulative and he always wins    it wishes to make it all about jan in the end   but the truth is   his change   although nicely done   is not full    we see him suffering from a personal crisis   and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart   but in the end   we don t fully believe it    and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision   the film choses an odd angle to go at   a noble one   but one that gives the film s conclusion that of incompleteness    in the opening of the film   we see him doing his old schtick   manipulating courts   winning cases effortlessly   and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases    in short   he s full of bullshit and we know it    in the film   he takes a case that is hardly desired   a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river    point one   it s not of the usual criteria   jan points out   wickedly   that dead or wounded children aren t nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success      point two   it has been through several lawyers    after turning them down   jan changes his mind   a muddled scene   he stops his car on a bridge   looks out       is he feeling a sense of overachievement       and he and his team of lawyers   tony shalhoub   zeljko ivanek   and accountant william h   macy   head out to the town to do battle with the town s company    they spend millions of dollars examining the land   test the water   what have you   this is where stephen fry   a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in   wilde     pops up thanklessly     and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children   and then   unsuccessfully   the workers at the plant    they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company   the eccentric jerome facher   played by robert duvall   more on him later on      as we progress   we get so involved in the way the story is being told   which is engulfing everything around it   including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople   one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland   who lost her child   who begins to have a personal crisis      things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half   as they are up against impossible odds   the judge   john lithgow   is not only a strickler   but a pal of facher   the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify   no concrete evidence is being found   depsite the money spent to find it   and they are quickly running out of money    as macy mortgages everything he can   including their homes and their office   he slowly loses his sanity   his meatiest role since   oh     fargo       and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist    in fact   the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par   owen gleiberman   especially   criticized the film for not being overly dramatic       i  suppose like a grisham novel      this wouldn t be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is   instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good   he s seen as being still full of bullshit    because he doesn t take stock in the cares of his partners   and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town   he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out    the final half tries to redeem this   as must have been the point of making this in zallian s mind   but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs   and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he s seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him   and thusly receiving two speeding tickets     we still feel that the big change in his life is that he s not rich and esteemed anymore   the film s final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow      the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case   it s still going on   you know     but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has    we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life   and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life    it only feels like half of that    maybe even less    and it s not travolta   who does a great job here   though never to be a truly memorable performance of his     but rather zallian   whose final chapter needs a rewrite    up to then   though   it s an engrossing drama   one of the best of the year in fact   and one of the best lawyer films   period    the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted   but rather it s about the lawyers   the knights who battle eachother    we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town   but the reason it can t be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find    and duvall s facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it s almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is    facher is seen as an elderly man   a goofy eccentric   carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it   eating lunches out of paper bags   and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio   and scold anyone who interupts him    but look deeper and you see a master at work   his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him   and it s difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way    that s why i liked this film   it s hard to put a pointer on    you can never see exactly where this film will land   and even when the credits roll   you still aren t sure what to make of it    call it the zallian effect    same thing happened with   schindler s list     not that i m comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman      each film is so greatly crafted that you can t help but get involved in its broad storytelling   interesting characters   and   most peculiarly   the wit that comes along with it    if only it felt totally complete   like   say     schindler s list     though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two     it might have been one of the best films of the year   and along with that   a full breath of fresh air

Neg, the best thing about     lake placid   is that it s only 80 minutes long and when it s over you re glad that you didn t waste more than an hour and a half of your time    it s nothing more than a bad rip off of     jaws     and i think that s being kind      it was written by david e   kelly     ally mcbeal     as a horror comedy but fails at both   miserably    i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once    the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in     anaconda      the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine    that brings the local sheriff   brendan gleeson   and a fish and game warden   bill pulman   to investigate    also   a paleontologist   bridget fonda   from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire/crocodile lover   oliver platt   flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast    soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it    there s also an eccentric old lady   betty white   who lives by the lake and has a few secrets    as i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor   h20   don t go for a serious approach towards the material but they also don t have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either    the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting   they re all basically idiots    if they had any brains the croc wouldn t have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldn t have put themselves in half of the situations that they did    but then again   if they were smart there wouldn t be a movie    basically     lake placid   is best undiscovered    
Pos, the central focus of michael winterbottom s   welcome to sarajevo   is sarajevo itself   the city under siege   and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there    it proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents     platoon       racial tumultuosness   the risible   the walking dead     or a tinge of schmaltziness     schindler s list        the two leads   stephen dillane as a reporter and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify with   are extremely believable   not one moment with them involved rings false    the question is not what went right    the question is what went wrong    for one   the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses   the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs   and that s about it        the assortment of high profile supporting actors   ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter   into   liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children s aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters   albeit they strive    the interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film   it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison    still   winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy   frantic editing and imaginative use of music    and it s a plus   because he doesn t toy with our emotions with sentimental blandness    he wants us to know that in war   no one is victorious    the sweet hereafter  starring ian holm   sarah polley   bruce greenwood   tom mccamus   gabrielle rose   arsinee khanjian   alberta watson   maury chaykin   caerthan banks    produced by atom egoyan and camelia frieberg    script by atom egoyan   based on the novel by russell banks      directed by atom egoyan    running time   110 mins    rated r                                                               atom egoyan s powerfully meditative   the sweet hereafter   is as anything as haunting and transcendental as i ve seen this year    it not only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tragedy with magnificent subtlety   with cold   and stunning shots of the backdrop of this mistfortune but also by telegraphing the sense of devastation that has permeated the small town with an enormous amount of dignity and respect for each and every soul affected    ian holm as the somber   lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople   has a decency and a restraint uncommon with lawyers   he s a lion for the wrong reasons   the pain for having lost his daughter   she s a druggie who frequently calls him begging for money   is reflected on the town    and in some mesmerizing flashbacks   we witness how she lost her purity    it s one of the most strikingly breathtaking takes on the loss of innocence i ve ever seen    but the most astounding part goes to sarah polly   the peaceful   benevolent girl who   in contrast to the other characters   remains the most mentally stable during past   present or future    her ability to convey concealed pain and unconditional love is the opposite   yet near revolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for   breaking the waves      both women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident but it is only then that we truly see   truly feel   their wordless   omnipotent love       the sweet hereafter   though   is atom egoyan s movie and as of now   he is emerging as the definite face of independent cinema    after surging to worldwide recognition with 1994 s   exotica       the sweet hereafter   makes him something few people in this industry can call themselves   an artist    he interweaves time with a delicacy and sees a soul with a purity that is just not common    
Pos, after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film   you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again    there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles   as a master would teach an eager apprentice       you caress the noodles with the chopsticks     he says     then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying    see you soon        of course   it s meant to be a parody   but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety    you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat   not something you like   not something you enjoy   but rather something you experience    experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses   fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts    trust me   you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point    juzo itami s tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western   set in modern day japan    a stranger   goro   tsutomu yamazaki     comes into town and finds tampopo   nobuko miyamoto     the proprietor of a small   hole in the wall noodle shop   trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman   pisken   rikiya yasuoka      goro   to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles   gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen   emerging bloodied   but victorious    goro finds that tampopo s ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away   just to eat a bowl of her ramen    the problem is   her fare is something less than popular   and less than appetizing    however   goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest   and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert   enlist the aid of a wealthy patron   and make friends with the former enemy    this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems    take   for example   when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner    the price is too high   but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum    tampopo meets him at his store late at night   and he leads her to a back room    she protests   thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives   but he insists    just when she is about to bolt for the exit   he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door    she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day   her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience    this scene   while comical   is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation   then of relief and discovery    there s also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who   despite their economic trappings   are all gourmets and master sommeliers    we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet    the scene is meant to bring a laugh   but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor   food is something which everyone has in common   and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all    there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film   which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people s lives    a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor    surrounded by her children   she is obviously in her last hours of life    her husband comes home   and seeing her worsened condition   demands that she get up and make dinner    the viewer knows the husband s intention is not to be mean   he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived   and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this    in a near miracle   the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal   then brings it to her awaiting family    as the family eats   she looks on them and smiles    preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her   and for a brief moment   she too enjoys the normalcy    then she falls over   dead    for a moment   the family is stunned   but then the father yells at the children     keep eating !  this is the last meal your mother ever made !    crying as they do so   the family finishes the meal    the scene is comical   awkward   moving   and beautiful    by including the vignettes   itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film   but surprisingly   they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline    instead   they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo s goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble    because the film parodies a western   the construction of the plot is fairly predictable   but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the   good guys   come together for the final showdown    in this case   the showdown is against the ramen    if they eat tampopo s ramen   soup and all   tampopo knows she has succeeded    it s pretty obvious what the outcome will be   but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life   you can afford to cut it a little slack    
Pos, an indian runner was more than a courier    he * became * the message he was carrying    what danger is a bear   to a message    i used to think sean penn was an immature   arrogant   photographer  punching   madonna marrying   loudmouth    but all that has changed now    the guy has grown up    and that s not all    it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director   if this film is any indication    one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo   given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper    but   no    this film is about a real struggle   and the victories and defeats are not simple    penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters   without unnecessary rush or flash    the focus of the story is two brothers    david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised   tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer    viggo mortensen is the wild brother   whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he can t name   much less resolve    the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam   and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line    it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared    the film is unobtrusive   simple   direct   plain   and sincere    it isn t exactly perfect   but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them    life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems    this is a good film without big budget sets   or big name stars pushed into your face    in fact   i m reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing    there were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw    i thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified   though there are a few free form sections which also work very well    the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche   but what are you going to do  this movie * does * take place in the 1960s after all    in my opinion   it is worth full price admission    
Neg, bats is this year s camp flick    with the world s worst dialogue   cheesiest premise and stupidest editor   this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity    as for the rest of us   well        i d say skip it   but looking at the box office figures for this one   it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway    follow their lead and you ll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot    i love alfred hitchcock s the birds   almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based    it saddens me even more   then   to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror/schlock such as bats    when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town   the authorities call in a batologist   dina meyer   to investigate    it turns out that a creepy scientist   bob gunton   has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab   making them smarter and more vicious    why has he done this   you ask    because   you see   it is apparently a scientist s job to make things   a little better     even if that means the death of all mankind    so the batologist   her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff   lou diamond phillips   have to kill all the bats and save the world    of course   that can t happen before they wallow in some guamo   bat shit   for the uninitiated     get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture    consider   for example   a scene where two people are in a bat cave    the bats are all sleeping   but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out    what do they do    do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can    nope    they stand there for a while   transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes    what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes    we don t even get to see what s going on   the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick    all we know is that bats are attacking    how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery    a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies   and bats sure could use some    of course   director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor   but it is so conventional it doesn t really go anywhere    most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist s wisecracking sidekick   leon     who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like   i hate bats !    some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality   they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept    i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one liners    playing such characters does not help actors  careers    still   i suppose that if you re looking for a movie that is   so bad it s good     you could do worse than bats    it does have a tremendous amount of camp value    i m not   recommending   the movie because   quite frankly   it sucks   and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it    more power to them

Neg, i have never been a   star trek   fan   and   to tell the truth   out of the five films in the series that i have seen   1   2   3   8   9     i have disliked all of them    i do   however   always go into one of these with an open mind   and the ninth film in the series     star trek   insurrection     is no exception    dropping almost completely the hard core sci fi element of the previous one in the series     first contact       insurrection     tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people   known as the ba ku   as well as the fountain of youth    at the start of the picture   the villagers go under attack by a second alien species   known as the son a   who want to push all of the ba ku out so that their own race will not die out    also attacking the ba ku is data   brent spiner     a robot from the star trek enterprise    after returning to jean luc picard   patrick stewart   and the gang on their space ship   no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force    so several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba ku   where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants   a sultry   kind alien woman   donna murphy     who is over six hundred years old   but looks to only be in her thirties       star trek   insurrection     is a completely unoriginal and cheap looking installment in the series   and is a big step down from   1996 s   first contact     which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different    in     insurrection     however   it plays like a low rent episode of the television show   due to the small scale   generic storyline   and an emphasis on one liners rather than excitement    the film was filled with nearly non stop comedy   and worse yet   most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff    meanwhile   when there were action sequences   they were not at all interesting or inventive   relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very   very slowly    this plot device   which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays   is getting old fast    are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax    another element of     star trek     films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest   but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later    although donna murphy   who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here   is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103 minute running time   alfre woodard was far superior in     first contact      she should have returned for this one   but i don t blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie s disappointing and often lifeless screenplay   by michael piller       star trek   insurrection     is perhaps the weakest film in the   star trek     series   although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst     star trek v   the final frontier         insurrection     is the type of   safe   sequel that will bewilder non fans   since it is so low tech compared to most of today s blockbuster action films   although most of these are honestly not very good   either     and should disappoint the loyal trekkies   since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts    on second thought   they probably should have completely thrown the script out    that way   they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness    
Neg, it happens every year    the days get longer   the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big budget blockbusters    this year s crop already seems inferior to that of past summers   even 1997 s lackluster trio of batman & robin   the fifth element and the lost world    the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla     heeere   lee zerd   lee zerd             which doesn t make me optimistic about future summers    godzilla is   of course   based on a series of cult movies   translation   really bad movies only a few people can tolerate   from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner owned cable stations    that this big budget remake won t rise above its roots is fairly obvious    the credits show us the origin of godzilla    in five words   nuclear explosion creates giant lizard    sounds like an enquirer headline   doesn t it    the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable   discovery   sequence    this time   a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling   if that ain t a stereotype          when he discovers the telltale radar blip    people die    cut to our protagonist   played by matthew broderick    he makes his first appearance wearing headphones   warbling along to   singin  in the rain      it s a none too subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie    no dice   bueller    from the beginning   poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla s enormous footprint    every disaster movie has to have a know it all scientist   and this time broderick is it    as the world s leading expert on radiated earthworms   and wouldn t you love to have that printed on your business card        broderick is invaluable to the government    he immediately dispels vicki lewis  theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because   hey   you can t take seriously the intellectual arguments of   newsradio   cast members    broderick instead hits the nail on the head   announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard       the radiation isn t an anamoly     he announces   and lightning strikes       i believe this is a mutated abberation     he continues   and lightning strikes again    it s vocabulary lightning   you see   activated by words of four syllables or more    meanwhile   we re introduced to our new york cast   headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist   maria patillo     broderick s former love    gee   what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time    poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer    italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she s not ruthless enough     nice doesn t get you anywhere in this town    it s dog eat dog      actually   it s lizard eat city   as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple s core    the filmmakers provide us with a one note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla       i think i ve got a bite     he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him    you can guess what happens next    similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city    hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps   one new yorker remarks     please don t tell me that s another parade      please don t tell me that s the best line you could come up with    mayor ebert is not pleased    played by the principal from   head of the class     he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option   and bickers with his assistant gene    i guess the filmmakers knew they d be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didn t even bother to kiss ass    the problem is   if you re going to attack siskel and ebert   you should at least make it funny    dialogue like     didn t we agree that we weren t going to have any sweets until after the election      followed by     back off   gene     just doesn t work for me    other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character s last name and frenchman jean reno s inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york    there s even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses    as the beast heads back into hiding   broderick suggests the military lure it out with food    cue twelve dump trucks   all dropping fish into a new york intersection       broderick   that s a lot of fish      that ambush fails   but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying $50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them    yep   godzilla s with children   which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla    that s until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually   like linda tripp    godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day   so it has a lot of dumb action scenes   destructive special effects and shallow subplots    look no further than patillo s betrayal of broderick   patillo   what have i done   animal    what have i become     and the climactic   godzilla s nest   sequence in madison square garden    the main difference is   independence day was about the experience    it had a real global   patriotic element to it   and some genuinely fun characters    godzilla has lots of rain and lightning   reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak   blockbuster   juicy fruit   swatch   sprint and bumble bee tuna    yes   bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla    that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie    
Neg, last summer   a feature length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning    based on the famous 60 s television show   the film was an enormous box office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros   a year later   the studio is up to their old tricks again   with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild   wild west    but it sounded promising   the same tag team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld   who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success   is at the reins again    and co star kevin kline is attached to the project   as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects    i mean   what could possibly go wrong    the answer is just about everything    wild wild west is a cinematic abomination   a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate    there are a lot of fancy special effects   and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression    but the script is so deliriously uneven   the entire movie so off course   that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it    at square one   we have a bizarre case of casting    will smith plays james west   a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series    my guess regarding the casting of african american smith is a simple one   the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved    smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material   but this is not an ideal role for him    he s too much of a joker    i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role   and frankly   that sounds a lot more plausible    what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self assurance in his eyes   you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office    the plot involves west and cross dressing government agent artemus gordon   kevin kline     who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists    the trail leads to the diabolical dr   arliss loveless   kenneth branagh     a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry   witty southern accent    loveless has taken the country s top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control   using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns    one such weapon is an 80 foot mechanical tarantula   bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right    the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular   seamlessly blending computer generated imagery with the western surroundings    unfortunately   all of these effects seem so detached from the story   and can do little to support the film s plot deficiencies   which are undoubtedly the main problem    wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works    most of the jokes   usually care of smith   die on arrival    if it s one thing that could possibly be the saving grace   it s the performances   and even they are mostly off kilter and poorly delivered    kline is admirable   but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot    salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest   because she is viewed as little more than that   window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon    branagh   an esteemed shakespearean actor and director   adds marginal enjoyment to the film    but even he is so utterly weird and over the top    rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is    i suppose there s always one turkey of the summer season   a highly anticipated   big budget release that manages to completely disappoint    wild wild west is such a movie   and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999    but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office    perhaps after this   audiences will be less assured when they see will smith s name stamped on a summer movie    after such hits as independence day and mib   wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume    
Neg, one night   during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets   we went to see    what else    hard rain       so   are we all going to die      the sheriff   randy quaid   asks in the story s opening line as he evacuates his flooded town    the answer is pretty much yes   but not nearly soon enough    and to add insult to injury   the supposedly dead   regretfully   often turn out not to be so    populating this bad tv movie of the week material are a host of talented actors    one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture    besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water   they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie    graham yost s script serves up one cliche after another for the actors   who thankfully managed to mumble quite a few of the lines    director mikael salomon s staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening    the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies   jr    s dark and ugly cinematography    the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water    onboard are guards tom and his uncle charlie    christian slater   who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart   plays tom    edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie    coming to their   rescue   is a gang headed by jim   played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman    he views the loot   three million dollars worth   as his retirement plan    the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang   who are in turn after tom    along the way   tom picks up a love interest in the person of a crucifix weapon wielding woman named karen   played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver    the action sequences are repetitive and without much interest    they do feature lots of explosions and gunfire to keep you awake    christopher young s emotionless score for the film has a single trait   ear shattering loudness    the plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks   submerging the town    the characters have an infinite number of bullets and rarely do they have to bother reloading their guns    the weapons and the ammunition spend most of the time under water or being rained on but always fire perfectly    when one of the bad guys drops a gun into the water   it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims to get it   even though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees    counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each other    the show has a single   but unprintable   good line    betty white plays an incessantly bossy wife   and   when her hen pecked husband finally told her off   our audience roared with laughter    the show concludes with a sickening set of twists    the best that can be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed to laughably bad    hard rain runs 1   37    it is rated r for violence and would be fine for teenagers       the two families behind us shockingly had a half dozen preschoolers among them      
Pos, scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well    during a film class discussion   windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are   and why sequels never live up to the originals    a few rare exceptions are noted   but they left out one            scream 2 !  1996 s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america !  a sequel was unavoidable   but luckily the re teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment    in fact   at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream   i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film !  sidney prescott   neve campbell     the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro   ca in the original scream   is now two years older and off to college   majoring in theater    meanwhile   tv journalist gale weathers   courtney cox     who covered the murders in the first film   has since written a book about the dreadful events   a book titled   stab     which has been developed into a major motion picture    as scream 2 opens   a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of   stab     and before long   a young couple are butchered to death   unnoticed in the midst of hysteria    this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown   copycat   sets out to repeat what s been done            and finish what hasn t !  of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film   and yes   movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds   but this * is * a sequel   and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies    this is in large part due to williamson s deliciously written script   which will easily leave you satisfied    as much as the film condemns the use of cliches   it is riddled with them   but it is done so effectively   and with skillful direction by craven   that you re not bound to complain    i will note   however   that the   whodunit      did wind up being the first person i suspected   but believe me   i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie    all the actors outdo themselves here    we re not talking oscar performances   but cambell   cox   david arquette as dewey riley   and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing    the characters remain true to their roots   and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years    we can see how the events in the first film has affected them   but we don t lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place    the nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn t seem off kilter from it s predecessor    it s a natural   smooth   and believable   as far as horror films go   transition from film to film    we skip two years   but there doesn t seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks    it flows so well that you feel more like you re reading chapter two of a book   long chapters   eh      than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces    while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels   scream 2 s entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first   making for immediate fondness and absorption    as i said before   scream 2 easily lives up to   if not surpassing   it s precursor    the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first    this doesn t mean that it overcasts the unique   whimsical humor or overall caliber of it s sequel   it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it s own while maintaining it s sought after qualities    if ever a film followed it s original so well   it would be scream 2   and it makes this a definite must see for all those unbridled scream fans out there    scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream   and will hopefully receive as many high remarks    it would top off the series quite well   if it weren t for the fact that two movies don t really make a series    it s unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won t appear in the next few years   but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror trilogy   let s hope they can keep up the fantastic work    like they say   don t mess with perfection            but when a money making smash hit is almost guaranteed   who s gonna listen    
Pos, synopsis   rumored to be about a true person   the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years   and has inspired operas   literature   and even coinage       since 1984   china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures   the 1992 set includes mulan      in the ballad of mulan   written in the 5th or 6th century     an imperial edict by the khan   emperor   orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china    a girl s parents hear sighing   and think that their daughter mulan   the name means magnolia   is dreaming of boys   but actually she s dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle    mulan bravely runs away   masquerading as a boy   to serve in the army instead of her father    ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later   the army finally returns in triumph    the emperor wants to reward mulan s valor with a prestigious position in government   but she declines   accepts a horse   and returns home quietly to don her true clothes    mulan s old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman    the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story   only it adds a modern character for comic relief   mushu the dragon   eddie murphy      in disney s mulan   when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army    old mr   fa   soon tek oh   is handicapped and has no son   he has only his spirited young daughter mulan   ming na wen      fearing for her father s life   the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair   disguises herself as a man   and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father s stead    meanwhile mushu   the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family   has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner       his only duty is to ring a gong      mushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero    with the help of mushu   a horse   and a lucky cricket   can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family    opinion   east meets west    i know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic   he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors    from their state of the art animation studio in orlando   disney is hoping to work the same kind of east/west magic with mulan    i mean   what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art   with donny osmond singing   ming na wen acting   and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson    yet this is the case in the disney s re interpretation of the familiar chinese classic    the end result is spectacular   mulan is one of disney s best movies ever    personally   i m also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak willed subservient asian woman take a beating   mulan is portrayed as a normal   if spirited   compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative    mulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney    kids of any age will like the family themes   and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing    and adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor   while the boys admire the battles    and adults can admire those male/female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family   honor   and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love   gumption   and questioning    but even the tiniest details reveal quality    the movie s art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look   negative spaces   positive detail   period clothing   and graphic designs typical of the time and place    computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30   000 people   and a special program called  attila  was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback    and singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game    balance is crucial    a movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney s cup of tea   but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine   then   pow !  the dream team    by the same token   a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself   but toss the dragon in there and you ve got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp    it s rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west   old and young   male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole   but mulan hits the universal bullseye    it s movie for any age   creed   gender   or color    
Pos, the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and   real   movies    consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved    lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste    top flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety    based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks   the movie represents a rethinking of the story s structure   not merely a literal adaptation of the novel    told in linear form by four narrators in the book   egoyan s version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator    the author is even on record as applauding egoyan s changes    in the press notes the book s author describes the story as   a parable of lost children      he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children    picking up on this   egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter   nicole burnell   played with grace by sarah polley   reads parts of   the pied piper   from an old   illustrated book to her two charges    periodically throughout the picture   nicole s readings are heard in voice over    you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment    they and the rest of the town s children come into harm s way    some live and others are seriously injured    and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again    although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children   the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss    ian holm   in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career   plays mitchell stephens   an intense man of quiet misery    mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small   snow encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness    his mission there is a singular one   to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone   anyone   on their behalf    if this seems crass   well it is   but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot    the story unfolds slowly and always believably    each little aspect has its own fascination    as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker   played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson   he has a simple task    he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit    wendell ticks off one town member after another and then   as one can in a small town   enumerates each person s numerous faults    although the town is no peyton place   people there do have their foibles    one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell   bruce greenwood     who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good bye to his kids    well   single parent billy s fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita    his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story    the accident itself   a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice   isn t shown until the middle of the picture   but   nevertheless   the mystery about it builds throughout the film    although the picture is no detective story   finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy    as the injured bus driver   gabrielle rose   dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning    to round out the story   mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear    his daughter zoe   caerthan banks   is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half way house and recovery center after another    fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help   she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk         i can help you     mitchell tries to reassure billy       not unless you can raise the dead     billy snaps back    mitchell s pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder      mychael danna s haunting music sets the stage for tragedy    the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur   but it is in the warm   shadowy   intimate moments indoors where it works best    the show   which is ripe for emotional manipulation   never plays with its audience    still   when the house lights go up   you may feel as i did    i could barely breathe   i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed    more than anything   the film is like a master painting    each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint    with the final color in place   the masterpiece is complete   and the ending credits roll    the sweet hereafter runs 1   50    it is rated r for mature themes   sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers    
Neg, to put it bluntly   ed wood would have been proud of this    a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor   hokey drama   zero logic and a crap screenplay    also   a beautifully anti climactic ending    not to say it didn t look intriguing when i saw the previews    so much for truth in advertising    roland emmerich   who s later   independence day   would look like   the 400 blows   compared to this   co writed and directed this inane sci fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens    in a useless opening sequence   men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it    it wouldn t be till present day    94   till they would actually figure it out    they re decipherer    a slightly neurotic scientist   nice twist     dr   dan jackson   james spader   doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare   who s life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word    why do they use him to decipher what no one else could    so there is a hokey ending !  duh !  he figures it out in about a minute    yea    and then they get a suicidal colonel or something     jack   o neill   kurt russel   with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position      why a suicidal colonel    for the ending !  you ll get the hang of this    they open the stargate   a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad    after an overdone special effects thing   they re       inside a goddam pyramid    so they went to egypt   right    wrong    they re on another planet that was filmed in egypt    they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra   the sun god   the androginous jaye davidson   with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma     and there are fights   explosions and a kiss between two people    yea    also melodrama   stupidity   hokey scenes and a bizarre language    an anti climactic ending ends with stupid lines     say hello to king tut   asswhole !      the quintessential line   lemme tell ya   and some convenient pesudo pseudo pseudo character development    by the end   you just wanna go home and watch   i don t know   the   outer limits   or something    the script s terrible    the special effects are okay   but nothing great    the story s so weak that it s almost opaque    the whole experience just isn t worth it unless you re so bored that you d consider watching a   full house   marathon       or  this    i d pick this   obviously   but still   it s just not fun at all    and i can t wait for it to premier on mst3k    
Pos, vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element   substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject   but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents    and   unlike any of the more outlandish myths   the vampire holds some real world probability   one study claims 1   000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide   and places 50 in los angeles      but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys   john carpenter would like to remind us that they are   and always have been   a truly frightening element of the thriller genre    and remind us he does in his latest film   vampires    there was some question   as halloween weekend approached   of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema s immensely successful blade   released in august    the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue   and don t even agree on some basic points of the slaying method       for instance   blade s main weapons are silver and garlic   whereas main character jack crow s technique is a wooden stake to the heart      blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization   while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate    both have their advantages   and here   carpenter s style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered    when it s all said and done   though   the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish   the level for gore is indeed set to maximum    this time   our hero is vatican sponsored slayer jack crow   james woods      he s a cynical   battle worn veteran   and the best of his bunch    he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest   and after exterminating a nest one night   they run up against a super vampire   termed a   master     named valek   thomas ian griffith      valek kills all of jack s team except for his partner   tony montoya   daniel baldwin     and as the two regroup   they learn that valek is the original vampire   now over six hundred years old    apparently   valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime    so with the aid of a priest named adam   tim guinee   and a bitten hooker   sheryl lee   as bait   they track valek down for the final confrontation    the script for vampires   written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel   is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year    crow   in particular   is a fun source of one liners   and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism    baldwin   lee   and guinee are all fine supports   adding to the character pool   but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffith s bad guy    griffith s intense expression is perfect for the role   and the only downside is that he s got to talk sometime    luckily   he s got few lines   and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance    all said   fans will surely be impressed by this picture   and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one    certainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters    
Neg, what would you do if no one could see you    well   if you re a super smart bio molecular research scientist working for the military   you d grope a co worker and rough up your neighbor from across the street    that s right    of all the non criminal possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible   in   hollow man   kevin bacon s character opts to commit sex crimes    er   it s kevin bacon who plays the super smart military bio molecular research scientist    something sounds horribly wrong already    but this is a paul verhoeven film   and the sleazepin director of such open crotch classics as   basic instinct   and the infamous   showgirls   never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic tendencies which   when you come right down to it   is all this film is about       hollow man   features a string of hapless   c list actors   among them bacon   elisabeth shue   josh brolin   and kim dickens   in a grade z plot with a lot of special effects that   frankly   don t look much better than those used in the 1933 version of   the invisible man      oh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he s attempting reentry but otherwise it s lots of   thermal   shots and inanimate objects   elisabeth shue included   bobbing around without any visible signs of support    since invisibility   once achieved   isn t much of an effect   the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other  it amounts to much of a muchness     the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon s character gets invisible he can head straight for them    it s as if that fascinating concept  what would you do if no one could see you     is  simply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin    as a horror film     hollow man   is unsophisticated and disturbing   in its intent   not its achievements   and not worth your time or your hard earned dollars    it s minor verhoeven  and even that s not saying much  and boy is it hollow    
Pos, `strange days  chronicles the last two days of 1999 in los angeles    as the locals gear up for the new millenium   lenny nero   ralph fiennes   goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips    he pines for his ex girlfriend   faith   juliette lewis     not noticing that another friend   mace   angela bassett   really cares for him    this film features good performances   impressive film making technique and breath taking crowd scenes    director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it    but as a whole   this is an unsatisfying movie    the problem is that the writers   james cameron and jay cocks   were too ambitious   aiming for a film with social relevance   thrills   and drama    not that ambitious film making should be discouraged   just that when it fails to achieve its goals   it fails badly and obviously    the film just ends up preachy   unexciting and uninvolving    
Pos, are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny    director/writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film   next stop wonderland      the two main characters   alan and erin   spend the entire movie in each other s orbit   catching glimpses of one another   yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion    is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together    does this predestination carry over to all aspects of life    as the film starts   erin castleton   hope davis     a melancholy 29  year old late shift nurse   is ending her live in relationship with her boyfriend   hoffman      rather   he is ending it with her    arriving home from work   erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment   car packed with his belongings    in a fumbling   amusing and self deluding ramble   he instructs erin to watch a videotape he s made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he s leaving    it s obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand   all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship    he then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief    erin s mother   holland taylor   in a surprisingly effective   small role     fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life   takes out a personal ad for erin    to erin s embarrassed horror   the ad describes her as a   frisky   cultured   carefree professional with a zest for life      eventually   erin responds to the tidal wave of responses   which makes for some of the most humorous   telling moments of the movie as she meets prospective suitors and   poseurs      alan   a plumber and aspiring marine biologist   first spots erin as he s cleaning the inside glass of a fish tank at the boston aquarium    wearing a wet suit and goggles   he follows erin from window to window   separated by the glass as erin   oblivious to his gaze   enjoys the fish    later   we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside   mere feet away    the movie spends it s entirety having their paths circle each other without crossing    there are several subplots involving alan    one concerns his attempts to get on the job track at the boston aquarium   thereby escaping his apparent fate to carry on the family plumbing business    another subplot involves his father s desperate attempts to force fate s hand by gambling away his life at the dog track    a distracting focus is put on alan s debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off    the movie tries too hard to make alan a likable guy    thankfully   his dream  guy persona is counterbalanced by erin s distant   yet fundamentally hopeful   personality    the film moves along at an unhurried pace   albeit too much so in the latter third   as we wait for the two to meet    co writers anderson and lyn vaus throw a couple of possible red herrings into the mix as the two find other possible relationships    the films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over    when alan and erin eventually do meet   we see that perhaps they both were destined for each other as they share a lingering   almost subliminally knowing   gaze    it s a sweet   measured moment    the disappointment comes in the fact that we ve come to know the pair   yet we don t get to view their impending romance    the film s inherent belief in the subtle persistence of fate and the wonder it can bring to one s life makes   next stop wonderland   a quiet pleasure in a cinematic landscape littered with explosions   shallow characters and overdone special effects    
Pos, capsule   a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg    joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs    it lets us see some new dinosaurs   is that an oxymoron     and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure    the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious    i had a good time       low +2    4 to +4    here goes my credibility    this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority    i liked the third jurassic park film    i even liked the second jurassic park film    in a lot of ways jurassic park   the lost world was a creative three way braiding together of michael crichton s novel the lost world   arthur conan doyle s novel the lost world   and the classic silent film version of the doyle    jp2 was an adventure   as doyle said     for the boy who s half man or the man who s half boy      that is what all the jurassic park films are    expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house    the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon s mines had under written characters also    jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs    the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be   and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting    some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds    that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require    i feel i got my money s worth    the story opens with eric   played by trevor morgan   and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica    this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park    they hope   no doubt   to get a look at the island s dinosaurs from a safe height    the height is safe   but driving the boat in the water is not    the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended    flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant   sam neill   in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide    he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs    but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go    doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple   william h   macy and tea leoni   who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs    they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn    he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once    right    guess what happens next    jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2    first it has alan grant and ellie sattler   laura dern   back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm    sattler has a much smaller part in jp3   but is still present to tie this story to the first    curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance    one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other   suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time    they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films    of course   these raptors look a little different also   so perhaps they are a different related species    not only are they more intelligent than in the past films   they are also more sympathetic    in this story they are not just killing machines   they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition    this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized    each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs   of course    in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus   not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus   but larger and presumably more nasty    it has a crocodile s head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright    perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs    sometimes they just move too fast to see    occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision    a few times we get unconvincing matte shot   particularly of the laboratory    but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films    the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams s score for the first film    joe johnston   who directs   already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky    a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay    the film they have made is a long way from great cinema   but it still is fun    if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today   the film is for you    i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the  4 to +4 scale    
Pos, disney s 35th animated feature   a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with   well   the superman story   is surprisingly soft at the center    great wit   great art   and a great villain   james woods as hades   lord of the underworld and local lounge act   can t quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero   his colorfully monotonous sidekick   danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil     and a largely unremarkable soundtrack       none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular  ly noteworthy    some lack lyrical snap    others need more memorable melodies    boring ballads we expect   but boring production numbers   too      so   hercules is a bit of a long sit   but you won t stay bored    the highlights include a nifty round of animated action   herc battling a cgi hydra     a steady stream of anachronisms     somebody call ix i i     and pop references     let s get ready to rumble !     a la aladdin   and several long overdue jabs at the mouse s marketing and merchandising depart  ments    while not as rock solid as hunchback   it s a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas    directed by ron clements and john musker   with voice credits including tate donovan   susan egan   bob goldthwait   matt frewer   samantha eggar   paul shaffer   and   as lighting bolt zeus   rip torn   who s having a very good summer   also appearing in trial and error and men in black    
Neg, ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his   or her   sophistication    it s full of stops and starts and usually   the punch line is ruined    i felt the same way watching drowning mona    skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy    there are some slightly successful attempts at humor   but they only serve as window dressing    there is a running gag about the town   verplanck   n   y     being a test town for the then new yugo    everyone drives a yugo   differentiating their cars with personalized license plates    even the police chief drives one    there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets    there also is a running gag about one of the characters   jeff   missing a hand and how it occurred    it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends    it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend    there are some sight gags that pop up as well   such as mona s tombstone   which reads   demoted     instead of devoted    still   the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond    the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona   midler      each scene with her is the same   scream at someone   hit someone   then scream some more    there s no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness    anyone off the street could have played the role   such as it is    the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts    each one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization    there is a burly   female car mechanic   so of course   there is a forced lesbianism gag    mona s son   jeff   marcus thomas   is a simpleton   hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth    chief of police rash   devito   likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter    there s nothing more to him    elle   the chief s daughter   campbell     is bland personified   a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married    mona s husband phil   fichtner   jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch    bob   affleck     elle s betrothed   and business partner to jeff   is a mumbling   obvious dullard    there is no contrast to any of the characters    by having at least one character with some wit   or wits   to serve as counterpoint to the others   perhaps steinfeld s attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better    ostensibly a murder mystery   drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately   then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer   who could be anyone due to mona s loving manner with everyone on town    even that aspect of the film fails   throwing in a convenient   ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things    it s been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood    what makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it s ineptitude    
Pos, i was born in 1970   which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons   8 tracks and disco    however   since i was 17 years old i ve seen more than my share of adult films    i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i m not against pornogrpahy    i ve seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available    director paul thomas anderson s boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema   the mid to late 70s    this was the period when x rated movies were real movies   shot on film   shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics    this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films   films that attempted to tell a real story    one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how   like in an any other billion dollar industry   the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete    in this case   the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette    burt reynold s manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur   known as jack horner    horner s has a steady   family   of performers   some of whom live in his plush l   a   home    but in the world of porn   performers are a commodity   the fresher   the better    when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque   he decides to add him to his stable    it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his    as directed by anderson   the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door    boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l   a    s hardcore film scene    but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends    the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut    by the film s final image   what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams    boogie nights is not about sex    it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers    in fact   the film isn t really about pornography at all    pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub culture to find acceptance of who they are    the film goes to brilliant   often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world    yet   like in the lauded tarantino films   these people still have their own moral code   their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively    the characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion    first stop   the den mother   julianne moore   in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son    second stop   the cuckold crewman   william h   macy   who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone   the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real life porn star nina hartley      but the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams    eddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it    with no real ambition of his own   he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame    his alcoholic mother   clearly dissatisfied with her own lot   abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house    horner introduces him to amber waves   moore   who immediately adopts him   a nuclear family is born    the surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her   babies   provides some of the films most poignant scenes    clearly   she is not even fit to manage her own life   let alone nurture these lost children    but the need to love and be loved is so strong   they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to    even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family    then again   perhaps its not so different from real families at all    eddie adams   who later takes on the screen name   dirk diggler     is skillfully acted by former pop star   mark wahlberg    i say   former   pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job    this is bold and brave territory for such a young man    he pulls it off marvelously    wahlberg is a   big   bright star   with a big bright future    boogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt   without the first amendment preachiness    its intimate studies of character make it the superior film    wahlberg s surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson s    but in my opinion   boogie nights   is not the best film of the year    i got the feeling that itus 2 1/2 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance    still   if the subject matter of this film intimidates you   thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing   but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway       ya  know   kinda like disco    
Neg, like a good action film should     metro   has action that keeps you involved    some action films have action sequences that are so conventional   our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts       the ghost in the darkness     which opened a few months ago   is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving   it not only invited my thoughts to divert me   it nearly put me asleep    but   metro   is one of the best action films in a while    it is hip   sharp   nifty   and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy    eddie murphy was in bad shape for a while    and this invites me to mention last year s   the nutty professor     which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be       metro   happens to be a lot better than any film in the   beverly hills cop   series    that is because   metro   takes itself seriously   but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun    eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible   and controlled people    the   beverly hills cop   movies all featured eddie as a reckless   wild cop   always crossing the line by just an inch    in   metro   he plays a hostage negotiator   so negotiation is his job   not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble    his character in   metro   takes himself seriously    eddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in   metro     and perhaps it is quite better off that way    murphy plays scott roper   and as i previously mentioned   he is a san francisco hostage negotiator    in the first tense situation in the film   we are introduced to roper s kind of work   as he tries to calm down a confused   unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up    murphy handles the scene seriously   without his usual happy go lucky   misfit humor    the film develops when its villain is established   and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda   a jewel thief   and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim       metro   takes different twists and slight turns   and there is one great   virtuoso chase scene   involving the a cable car    cars flip    cars crash    cars turn over    and it is done so good in this film   i was reminded of   speed     and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons    there are also some other good scenes in   metro   that a lot of films would rather choose not to have    scenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning    of course   the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling    the scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice   too    those are the scenes that make up   metro     which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality    the actor that i most enjoyed seeing in   metro   was michael rapaport   who plays roper s new partner   a lip reading   book skimming genius   and a master of observation    it was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius    rapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really   really dopey dimwit    i hardly recognized him in   metro     and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more    there are two main types of villains in movies like this   the ones that are part of the story   and the ones that are devices    the villain in   metro   is no more than a device   but he is a darn good villain nonetheless    he is played by michael wincott   whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp   as if he smokes a cigarette between every take    wincott makes his villain   korda   as mean as could be   the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks   like richard widmark in   kiss of death      and   in addition   wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms   in the film   actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have   who is no longer on my good list    i liked   metro     and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy    his past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place   possibly from murphy s growing as a person   now having a family       metro   is a no nonsense movie    it works as a buddy movie   which it does not overplay    it works as a dry comedy   which it does not overplay    it works as a suspense film   which it does not overplay    and it works as an action film   where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all out    but who cares    it still remains serious   and it does not overdo itself    oh   and there were plenty of explosions in   metro     as well    how nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those    if there is one major objection i had to   metro     it was the length   an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes       metro   is a film that lasted a little too long   but it was still entertaining   and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end    paul haynes   >  
Neg, martial arts master steven seagal   not to mention director !   has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights   talks in a hushed tone   and squints at any sign of danger    he s also the most consistent individual in hollywood today   since all his movies suck    they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art   that is   martial art      i m sure the guy s good   and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows   although a tad haughty   but these movies he makes are all the same   a guy who is basically indestructable   is maybe wounded supposedly mortally   then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses   although i kinda liked   under siege        of course   this one   as a change   has a   message   that is drilled into our mind       of  course   after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people    so why do i watch his crap    i usually don t    i will never   and you can hold me to this   i will never pay to see this man s movies   unless   and only unless   he s in a supporting role   i   e       executive decision     and i d definitely pay if he dies   i   e       executive decision        but this one has a special place in my heart    this doesn t mean it s good or that i even liked it    this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle   and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la   mystery science theatre 3000     and this was a couple years before i had heard of   mystery science theatre 3000      in this one   seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased up typical shallow villain   this time played by an oscar winner to give the movie some more clout   michael caine    it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land    around the 20 30 minute point   seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs   what with his new   fire down below     another   message film       and caine has him bumped off       or  does he    seagal is rescued by some inuits   and falls in love with one of them   played by joan chen   who can act   hypothetically   but   for some reason   not here    one of caine s cliched henchmen   played here with a lot of overacting by john c   mcginley   shoots the cheif of the inuit clan   and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory       literally    of course    at one point   seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn t have any options but blow stuff up    he even goes as far as to say     i don t want to kill someone     and in the same breath   he asks some guy where the arsenal is    i have no problem with violence    i m a huge john woo fan   but he paints his films with suspense   skill   style   depth   characterization   and just plain cool violence    in the films of seagal   the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly   and him either wounding or killing them    at some points   they use the cliche of the talking villain   where the villain has the advantage   can shoot seagal   but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan   or saying a corny line   to which seagal says something hokey back   and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them   and does    this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn t take itself seriously at all   like in the case of this summer s   con air      but seagal is serious about his skill   and of course   his message    i wouldn t mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence    but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle   not pounded into the viewer s mind    the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish   thus we can t take him and his motives seriously   and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment   he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig   and kills some workers who were just doing his job    then at the end   he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech   just in case you didn t get the message from the trailers    what seagal doesn t realize is that no one takes his films seriously   although maybe a couple do   and any message he has is no only redundant   but doesn t comfortably fit in his film   which is filled to the brim with hokey violence   crap suspense   stupid melodrama   and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish    as far as seagal and his acting   he s rather boring    he squints   he kills    period    nothing else    oh   yeah   there s corny one liners     i m gonna reach out and touch someone !        of course   he s the star   and we re supposed to root for him and all   so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks    michael caine   who s a great actor   is just supposed to yell and look cold    he does it well   i guess   but this is no   alfie      of coure   no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him    his big henchman   john c   mcginley is kinda boring as well   but is not horrible    and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid   r   lee ermey   from   full metal jacket     as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is   just for the movie trailers and for seagal s ego    and also   look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey s assasins    anyway   to conclude this all   to judge one of seagal s movies is to judge all of them   except for   under siege   and   executive decision     though the latter is not really a   seagal movie        they all have this same formula   they all have the same action   same villain   same plot   but this one has that message   which makes it more excrucitating to watch    i mean   if you do rent it   and i don t reccomend you do   make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes    but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad   that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one    my   extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock    
Neg, plot   a young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth   oops       i  mean   an evil man    he vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself    anyway   fourteen years go by and       arrgh   well   you know the rest       swish swish zzzzzzz !  critique   this is a pretty bad movie    let s see   where should i start    okay   first of all   the story is just plain boring    it s not original   is entirely predictable and lacks energy    okay   what s next    acting   you say    hmmmm   well   the main actor   justin chambers   is basically an uncharismatic version of chris o donnell but with less range   think about that !     and mena suvari   is just plain off    not as bad as thora birch was in dungeons & dragons   but entirely miscast   with bad deliveries   awful sequences and a piss poor accent that comes and goes    now i m not sure if this was ms   suvari s fault or the director s   but i ve definitely seen her at a much higher level than in this film    the only semi saving grace actor wise is tim roth as the irrepressible   bad guy     but once again   it s not something that we haven t seen before       a  thousand times       by the same guy ! !  tim   please       for the love of god   beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day   american roles   for you as a   nice guy   in a romantic comedy or something    stretch   dude       stretch ! !  we all know that you can do much better than this gunk    alright   what else was bad in this film    oh yeah   the score !  yikes   how s about taking it down a few notches there   fellas    this thing blares in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene   but actually does little more than annoy    i think it s important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn t a   real epic   by any stretch of the imagination    it s a fluffy rehashed cake walk created by some   shrewd   studio heads who decided to take advantage of the whole   kung fu   phenomenon in films   and test it out on an old classic    dudes       you  failed all around !     keep reading    the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie   the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problems       plentiful !     why does the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way back to the top    why don t they just cut the mouseketeer s rope at the top of the tower   instead of jumping down on their own chords and fighting him while hanging    why doesn t anybody look a day older   when the sequence says   14 years later         at least       change  your shirt   man !    keep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing certain movies that are created simply for the sake of a   fun time     but this flick just didn t cut it for me    it was boring for stretches   the acting was atrocious at times   the   romantic   scene between suvari and chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe     there was little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeers fat    i will give the movie this much   and that is that its main reason for being   its   raison d etre     as the french would say     its fight sequences   do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film    i was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer   but what you see there   are essentially the snippets from the two major   and cool   swashbuckling sequences from the film    the first comes right at the beginning of the movie   while the other essentially finishes the film off   hanging from the tower and juggling off ladders    the ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap    and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film s credits    hullo    the film is called the musketeer and stars a dude name justin chambers    deneuve is barely in this movie !  ugh   just another small thing that annoyed me about this trash    now say it together   gang     all for one   and one for all       we  vow to stay away from it all ! !    thank me later    where s joblo coming from    a knight s tale   7/10     american outlaws   5/10     crouching tiger   hidden dragon   7/10     the matrix   8/10     the replacement killers   6/10     romeo must die   3/10     shanghai noon   6/10    
Neg, starring shawnee smith   donovan leitch   ricky paull goldin   kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960 s classic   a term that i use very loosely to define the original   about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way    now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel    the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn t exactly hurt it either    fast forward to the late  80 s    steve mcqueen isn t in the remake   this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years      nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role    that is unless you count matt dillon s brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter    the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original    the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets    it looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets    the special effects in this movie are cheesy   like the original s    unlike the original   they don t look campy   they just look cheap    one bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith    she is very attractive and can actually act   which is more than i can say about some of her costars    in terms of plot   a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky    seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite    anyway   the pink stuff has a taste for humans    the more people it absorbs   the bigger it gets    and it isn t the friendliest goop on the block either    anyway   it attacks this little town and it s up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it    not really   but that is how it seems    this version attempts to recapture the camp of the original    as i ve already said   this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap   badly acted   and badly written than campy    in the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness    although   star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon    the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple    they all stunk out loud    although some of the film s smaller roles are filled with some actors that   while not big stars   are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows    it also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible    sadly   it doesn t work very well    if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town   then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original       although that isn t so hot either      this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities    
Pos, the heartbreak kid   reviewed on aug   26th/1998    starring charles grodin   cybill sheppard   eddie albert  in   the heartbreak kid     charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters i ve seen on screen in a long time    he s a guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another    i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film    as the film opens   he has just gotten married   and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon    halfway there   he begins to resent his bride    by the time he arrives at his hotel and has met the cybill sheppard character   he is ready to divorce his wife    as played by grodin   this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him    the phrase   the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence   was practically written with him in mind    however   if he finds something he really wants   he will pursue it for as long as it takes    the only problem is   once he has it   he immediately loses interest    the end of   the heartbreak kid   is both hilarious and sad for that very reason    charles grodin is at his smarmy best here   and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodin s desire    however   the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin   daughter of director elaine may   as grodin s whiny bride    she owns every scene that she s in   and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do       the heartbreak kid   was written by neil simon and it shows    simon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships   and he s at the top of his game here    as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is   he s the type of guy that everyone knows    the character of george costanza on   seinfeld   seems to have been modelled after him    the only problem with the film is that it s not that funny   and it s billed as a comedy    as much as i could see the realism in the characters   it would have been nice to have a chuckle here and there       the heartbreak kid   is not a date movie    it has an extremely negative view of relationships   so seeing it with a girlfriend/boyfriend   could be hazardus to your health
